0) Nausea and vomiting are significant side effects in bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients who receive high-dose preparative regimens. 
1) Our objective was to conduct a prospective, randomized study comparing two different administration methods of high-dose ondansetron during a BMT preparative regimen in breast cancer patients. 
2) All patients received ondansetron as an intermittent (INT=24 mg i.v. q 12 h/day) or continuous intravenous infusion (CIV=8 mg i.v. loading dose followed by a continuous infusion of 2 mg/h per day). 
3) There were no differences in efficacy when high-dose ondansetron was given as CIV or INT for the control of nausea and vomiting in breast cancer patients undergoing high-dose CT for autologous BMT.

0) This isdue to the higher than standard doses and the combinationsof chemotherapy utilized, and also to the known variancesin emetogenicity patterns. 
1) To date, no dose-limitingadverse events have been reported with ondansetron.
2) We wanted to evaluate apatient population receiving the same chemotherapy drugs(and hence the same emetogenic potential) on the sameschedule to avoid difficulty in interpretation of results.
3) Patients were excluded for the following reasons, a Karnofskyperformance status of <60%, chronic nausea and/or vomiting or nauseaand/or vomiting of other etiologies, including, but not limited to,gastric outlet obstruction, increased intracranial pressure or brainmetastases, documented vomiting or retching episodes or uncontrollednausea in the 12 h prior to the first dose of i.v. ondansetron,radiation therapy administered as part of the preparative regimen, ormedications with known or potential antiemetic activity administeredin the 12 h prior to the initiation of i.v. ondansetron. 
4) The restrictedmedications included benzodiazepines, butyrophenones, corticosteroids,cannabinoids, phenothiazines, antihistamines, tricyclicantidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, metoclopramide, trimethobenzamide,scopolamine, fluoxetine, dipravan, paroxetine andsertraline. 
5) Patients were also excluded if they required any of the restrictedmedications during the study period. 
6) Premedications for transfusions, such as diphenhydramine orhydrocortisone, were not excluded.
7) All patients received a preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide1500 mg/m2 i.v. q 24 h´4 doses, thio-TEPA 125 mg/m2i.v. q 24 h´4 doses and carboplatin 200 mg/m2 i.v. q 24 h´4 doses(Fig. 1). 
8) Recently, Hesketh etal. classified the acute emetogenicity of antineoplastic agents.
9) Although thio-TEPA’s emetogenicity is not ranked byHesketh et al. [14], the formula he proposed to rank the emetogenicityof combination chemotherapy indicates the maximum level 5(>90% emesis frequency without effective antiemetic prophylaxis)for this regimen.
10) Antiemetic therapyUpon enrollment, patients were randomized to either an intermittent(INT) or a continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) ondansetron regimenusing a 1,1 block randomization scheme. 
11) Ondansetron therapy was initiated 30 min beforethe first dose of chemotherapy for both study arms. 
12) The history included a review of demographic information and historicalstatus of cancer. 
13) An episode of vomiting was defined as expulsion of any stomachcontents through the mouth. 
14) An episode of retching was defined asan attempt to vomit that was unproductive of stomach contents. 
15) Continuous vomiting and/orretching was defined as two or more vomits and/or retches within 1min of each other. 
16) Nausea was assessed by a numerical visual analoguescale ranging from 0 to 100 mm, with 0 mm representing nonausea and 100 mm representing the worst nausea ever experienced.
17) Patients,assisted by nurses when necessary, were responsible for recordingthe number of vomits and retches. 
18) The need for rescue therapy was left to the discretionof the patient and/or investigator. 
19) At the end of each 24-h period oftherapy, emetic episodes were graded. 
20) Clinical analysisEach patient was evaluated as having been a “success” or “failure.”
21) A failure was definedas 5 or more emetic episodes or a requirement for rescue therapy.
22) The proportion of successes and failures in each arm for each dayof the study was compared. 
23) Thepercentage of patients requiring rescue antiemetics and the numberof rescue antiemetic doses administered each day were evaluated.
24) The Wilcoxon signed-rank testwas used for nonparametric variables. 
25) Data were analyzed for these two patientsup until the time they withdrew from the study (day –5and day –4). 
26) Thirty-four patients were randomizedto INT ondansetron and 32 to CIV ondansetron. 
27) Meanage, age range, ethnicity and disease status were evenlydistributed between treatment arms, as illustrated in Table 1.
28) Means were compared with a t-test, and categorical variableswere compared with the Chi-square test. 
29) The onlysignificant difference (P=0.05) detected between treatmentarms in Table 1 was the mean age. 
30) This difference was notfelt to be clinically significant.
31) The worst grade of emesis was determined for each patientover the entire study period. 
32) There was no statisticaldifference between treatment groups in the worst grade ofemesis (P=0.49, 2-tail Fisher’s exact test). 
33) Figure 2 illustrates the percentage ofpatients experiencing success (complete, major, or minorcontrol) of emesis control per day. 
34) There was no significantdifference between treatment arms in grade of emesisper day for the entire study period. 
35) No significant differenceswere detected between study arms for these threevariables. 
36) Documentation of the number of retches waspoor, with only 43% of 386 possible values recorded.
37) Vomiting and nausea scores were missing in 5% and 24%,respectively.
38) From day –7 through day –2, the INT group received amean (±SEM) of 11.9 (±1.4) rescue medications and theCIV group received a mean (±SEM) of 14.4 (±1.9) rescuemedications (P=0.30). 
39) Additional study ofvarious combinations of antiemetics in BMT recipients isneeded to help determine the most efficacious regimen inthese patients.
