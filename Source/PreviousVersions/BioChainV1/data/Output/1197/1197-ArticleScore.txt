Summary:
Summary (2 StdDev, Compression=0.25,47 of 187)
-------------

0) Results,After a median follow-up of 59 months, 60 patients had relapsed and 48 died (28 and 20 in the treatment arm and 32 and 28 in the control arm, respectively). 
1) The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 48 months in the treatment group and 16 months in the control group (P = .04), and the median overall survival (OS) was 75 months for treated and 46 months for untreated patients (P = .03). 
2) Therefore, our data favor an intensified treatment in similar cases. 
3) The treatment of limb sarcomas mainly relies on a combined-modality approach, after the demonstration that pre-or postoperative radiation and conservative surgery led to local control in a high proportion of patients.4 In fact, limb-sparing procedures allow an 85% to 90% local dis-ease-free survival (DFS) rate and demolitive surgery now represents only 5% to 10% of the operations in comparison with the 50% survival rate of the 1960s to 1970s.
4) Their main differences, compared with the previous studies, are the introduction of ifosfamide (IFO) and the intensification of doses in combination with hematopoietic growth factors, and more restricted selection criteria. 
5) Here we report the results of the Italian co-operative study after a median follow-up of 59 months and a minimum time between randomization and date last seen of 28 months among patients who did not die. 
6) The time of the analysis (November, 1999) was 36 months after the last randomization. 
7) This time of analysis was chosen because it is generally agreed to be the period in which the great majority of events appear in a patient population with high-risk extremity sarcomas. 
8) After a positive biopsy for sarcoma, all patients underwent complete staging and programmed local treatment. 
9) Treatment started after the completion of any local treatment and/or as soon as the wound had healed (Fig 1). 
10) Inclusion criteria were as follows, age, 18 to 65 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2, primary tumors subfascially localized with diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm, high-grade spindle-cell or polymorphous sarcomas (fibrosarcoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, polymorphous liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, malignant schwannoma, angiosarcoma, and polymorphous rhabdomyosarcoma), local relapse of any size, no previous radio/chemotherapy, adequate bone marrow (WBC count of >= 4,000/fiL, platelets = 120.000/mL, and hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL), renal (creatinine <= 1.3 mg/dL), hepatic (SGOT <= 2.5 X normal value and bilirubin <= 1.2 mg/dL), and pulmonary functions.   
11) Local Treatment 
12) Adjuvant Treatment 
13) In the case of incomplete hematologic recovery (defined as WBC < 4,000/mL and platelets [PLTS] < 100.000/mL), treatment was postponed by one or more weeks, furthermore, on complete hematologic recovery, a dose reduction of EPI was applied depending on the observed nadirs (WBC > 1,000/mL and PLTS > 75.000/mL, IFO and EPI doses both 100%, WBC > 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL, IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 75%, WBC < 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL, IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 50%). 
14) A difference of P <= .001 (two sided) in DFS between the two groups was considered sufficient to stop patient accrual. 
15) The study period was calculated from randomization to the first occurrence of the considered events (local recurrence alone, metastasis with or without local recurrence, death due to disease, toxic death). 
16) In November, 1996, the per protocol interim analysis of disease-free survival revealed a significant difference in favor of chemotherapy (P = .001), therefore the accrual was stopped and the data reported. 
17) Overall, there were no statistically significant differences in the considered parameters between the two groups. 
18) However, the median diameter is the same in the two groups, and the difference in range is caused by a small number (three patients) of large tumors in the control group. 
19) Local Treatment 
20) Seven patients (13%) did not start adjuvant treatment. 
21) The median time between surgery and the start of chemotherapy was 62 days (range, 8 to 187 days), in the three cases with early metastases, the time intervals between surgery and relapse were 42, 74, and 89 days. 
22) Of the 46 patients that started chemotherapy, four did not complete the treatment. 
23) One patient refused the fifth and last cycle for personal reasons, and three patients did not complete the treatment because of related toxicities (reappearance of viral uveitis, consecutive episodes of pneumonitis, and persistent leukopenia) after two, three, and four cycles, respectively. 
24) In 8% of these cases, the delay was between 7 and 14 days, thus representing the real recovery time from previous toxicity. 
25) The average median relative dose-intensity (DI) of the program was 83.3% (Table 2), 63% of the cycles were given at a DI of >= 80% and 48% at a DI of >= 90%. 
26) At the time of statistical analysis (November 1999), the median follow-up for the 104 patients included in the study was 59 months, 61 months in the treatment arm and 55 months in the control arm. 
27) The ranges for the observation time (ie, the time between randomization and date of last visit) among censored patients who did not die were 28 to 84 months, 39 to 84 months, and 28 to 81 months, respectively. 
28) Univariate analyses did not reveal any statistically significant difference in overall DFS and OS for any of the characteristics considered (age, sex, center of surgery, histology, grading, site of primary tumor, presentation, diameter, local treatment, and stratification) with the exception of adjuvant treatment (data not shown). 
29) In four patients, the first event was a synchronous local relapse with metastases (one patient in the control arm and three patients in the treatment arm). 
30) Furthermore, nine patients developed metachronous relapse at a different site (three were local relapse after a metastasis and six were distant relapses after a previous local relapse). 
31) The median overall DFS was 48 months among treated patients and 16 months in the control group. 
32) Local DFS 
33) Overall, 13 patients had a local recurrence of disease as the first relapse without simultaneous distant metastases (four patients in the treatment arm and nine patients in the control arm, Table 4). 
34) Four patients had local relapses simultaneously with metastasis (one patient in the control arm and three in the treatment arm), and another three patients developed a local relapse as the second relapse after a distant metastasis (two patients in the treatment arm and one patient in the control arm). 
35) Taking into account the overall local relapse rate (all local events observed), 11 patients in the control group and nine in the treatment group experienced local failure. 
36) As the first event, a total of 47 distant relapses were observed (22 single distant events in the control group and 21 in the treatment group, one synchronous distant and local event in the control group and three in the treatment group Table 4). 
37) Overall, the difference in distant relapses as the first event between the two arms was not significant (P = .48, Fig 3). 
38) DISCUSSION Adjuvant treatment of localized soft tissue sarcomas is controversial because no sufficient and convincing data are available. 
39) The preliminary data of previous studies were sometimes positive for DFS and OS,15-19 but further analyses, made after an adequate follow-up time, indicated a disappearance of the positive effect of chemotherapy on 20,21 and, in some cases, worse results.22 However, the recently published meta-analysis,7 involving 1,568 patients, showed a statistically significant benefit for treated patients of 6%, 10%, and 10% for local, metastatic, and overall DFS, respectively, and a favorable (but not statistically significant) trend in OS (4%), after a median of 9.4 years of follow-up. 
40) Furthermore, in the subgroup of 886 patients  affected by extremity sarcomas, the difference in OS between treated and untreated patients was significant (P = .029), and the absolute benefit after 10 years increased to 7%. 
41) First, the selection criteria were different between studies, resecting the different times at which the studies were activated (1973 to 1990). 
42) Furthermore, the univariate analysis performed at interim analysis and repeated yearly thereafter for all characteristics reported in Table 1 did not reveal any statistically significant differences between the two patient groups, except for chemotherapy. 
43) A difference of P = .001 (two sided) in DFS between the two groups was considered sufficient to stop patient accrual. 
44) This unfavorable local behaviour is mainly because of the dimension of local disease, in our opinion. 
45) In fact, the median diameter of the primary tumors and relapses was 10 and 9 cm, respectively, with no differences between treatment and control groups (Table 1). 
46) However, between the three different local approaches there was a trend in favor of preoperative radiation therapy (two local relapse of 24 patients in the control arm, 8.3%).
