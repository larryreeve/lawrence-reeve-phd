0) The number of progenitor cells was evaluated in the harvest and before and after leukapheresis in the peripheral blood.
1) RESULTS, The number of harvested CD34+ cells (4.8 × 106 vs. 3.4 × 106/kg body weight, p<0.001) and colonyforming units–granulocyte-macrophage (3.1 × 105 vs. 2.4 × 105/kg body weight, p = 0.0026) was significantly higher for LVL procedures than for NVL procedures. 
2) The median extraction efficacy, defined as the difference between the yield in the harvest and the decrease in thetotal number of CD34+ cells in peripheral blood during leukapheresis, was significantly (p<0.0001) higher for LVL than for NVL (2.6 × 108 and 8 × 107, respectively).

Summary (2 StdDev, Compression=0.25,35 of 137)
-------------

0) The yield of CD34+ cells obtained by leukapheresis issignificantly influenced by the extent and duration ofprior chemotherapy, therapy with stem cell-toxic drugssuch as carmustine or melphalan, and extensive radiotherapy.
1) In some uncontrolled studies, an influence of theleukapheresis size on the number of PBPCs in the harvestwas observed. 
2) Large-volume leukapheresis (LVL) is definedeither by processing a minimum of 15 L of peripheralblood or by processing more than three times the totalperipheral blood volume. 
3) It has been suggestedthat it might be possible to harvest sufficient numbersof PBPCs for transplantation by one LVL only. 
4) In 50percent of previously treated patients it has been possibleto harvest more than 1.0 × 106 CD34+ cells per kg of BW ina single LVL procedure. 
5) However, these favorable resultscould not be confirmed in all investigations. 
6) After giving informed consent, patients in each patientgroup, that is, BC and NHL, were randomly allocated bysealed-envelope technique to undergo either LVL in which4.5 ± 15 percent of the total peripheral blood volume wasprocessed and an NVL in which 2.5 ± 15 percent of the totalperipheral blood volume was processed on the consecutiveday, or vice versa (an NVL followed by an LVL). 
7) Inclusion criteria for patients with NHL were large-cell lymphomawith persistent disease after standard chemotherapyor at relapse or low-grade NHL stage III/IV andprogressive disease. 
8) All patients with chemotherapy-sensitivedisease were eligible. 
9) Exclusion criteriaExclusion criteria were refractoriness to platelet transfusion,disorders of blood coagulation, heparin-inducedthrombocytopenia, disease manifestation in the centralnervous system, fever >38.5°C within 48 hours beforeleukapheresis, dilatative cardiomyopathy, symptomatic ischemicheart disease, heart attack within 6 months beforeleukapheresis, chronic lung disease with hypoxemia, severedrug-resistant hypertension, severe nonadjustable diabetes,epileptic seizures, impairment of renal function withserum creatinine >2.0 mg per dL, elevation of liver enzymes>3 times the normal value and/or a bilirubin value >2.0 mgper dL, clinical symptoms of impaired cerebral blood circulation,severe psychiatric disease, and previous bonemarrow or PBPC transplantation.
10) Patients and study populationDuring the study period, a total of 100 patients underwentPBPC mobilization and harvest. 
11) After mobilization and progenitorcell harvest, two patients with NHL and two withBC were not eligible for HDCT and PBPC transplantationbecause of progressive disease. 
12) In patients with partial remission or initial bonemarrow involvement, PBPCs werecollected again after further cycles ofchemotherapy. 
13) Bags of PBPCs harvestedas late as possible during treatmentbut still containing a sufficientnumber of PBPCs were chosen fortransplant.
14) Calculations were performed with asoftware program (Statistical Analysis System, version 6.12,SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 
15) Results were considered to be significantlydifferent when the p value was below 0.05.
16) RESULTSYield of CD34+ cells and extraction efficacyThe median number of CD34+ cells was significantly higherin LVL than in NVL (Table 3 and Fig. 2). 
17) In all butthree of these patients, the NVL was scheduled on Day 2.
18) As this value was greater than zero for both procedures, NVLas well as LVL seems to lead to a recruitment of PBPCs.
19) But patients with BC hadsignificantly higher (p = 0.012 and p = 0.028, respectively)median numbers of CD34+ cells per µL in peripheral bloodbefore leukapheresis than patients with NHL had (LVL, 61vs. 24, NVL, 64 vs. 23). 
20) Moreover, in patients with BC, themedian extraction efficacy was significantly higher(p<0.0001) for LVL than for NVL, whereas, in patients withNHL, there was no difference (p = 0.24) between the twoprocedures (see Table 3).
21) In PBPCtransplantation, patients received a median of 2.7 × 106CD34+ cells per kg of BW (range, 1.0-7.8 × 106) and a medianof 2.0 × 105 CFU–GM per kg of BW after cryopreservation(range, 0.7-10.4 × 105). 
22) A platelet count >20,000per µL without transfusion support was reached after amedian of 12 days (8-70) after transplant.
23) Twenty-five transplantations were performed in 24 patientswith grafts from study leukapheresis proceduresalone. 
24) In 23 transplantations, the graft of one leukapheresiscomponent was sufficient in PBPC content. 
25) Seventeen patients,14 with BC and 3 with NHL, received a graft from anLVL. 
26) Only 1 of these patients with BC needed a total harvest,the other 16 received only one-half of the leukapheresiscomponent. 
27) In both LVL and NVL, the median extractionefficacy was greater than zero, which suggests thatadditional PBPCs must have been recruited into the peripheralblood during leukapheresis, as also reported by others.
28) The number of “recruited” CD34+ cells per kg of BWis in the magnitude of 1 (NVL) to 3.5 (LVL) times that in atransplantation dose. 
29) Our observation that the extractionefficacy of LVL differed in patients with BC and those withNHL may help to explain conflicting data in the literature.
30) In children, the processing of more blood volumes does notnecessarily lead to increased recruitment of PBPCs. 
31) The phenomenonof hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization is poorlyunderstood. 
32) Stem and progenitor cells are released from thebone marrow into the peripheral blood, where they can beharvested by leukapheresis. 
33) At least from a kinetic point of view,a transient, rapid increase, such as that after physical exerciseor the administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone,endotoxin, dextran sulfate, or antibodies againstthe cell adhesion molecule VLA-4, can be distinguishedfrom a delayed, sustained increase that can be observed, forexample, after the administration of G–CSF.
34) Preliminarydata (Humpe A, manuscript in preparation) suggest that thedecrease in CD34+ cell numbers in peripheral blood duringleukapheresis and the increase in the numbers in thecollection bag can be well described by a cell-kinetic modelconsisting of the three distributional compartments, bonemarrow, peripheral blood, and extracorporeal volume.
