Summary-Abstract:
Summary (2 StdDev, Compression=0.25,3 of 12)
-------------

0) Seventy-nine have received two full courses of therapy. 
1) Controllable clinical congestive heart failure developed in seven patients, and four others had a deterioration of noninvasive measures of cardiac function without clinical failure. 
2) Two of 22 (10%) patients receiving doxorubicin and five of 24 (21%) receiving mitoxantrone as secondary therapy responded.

Summary (2 StdDev, Compression=0.25,28 of 109)
-------------

0) MAJOR ADVANCES in breast cancerthroughout the past decade have includedthe widespread introduction of combination andmultimodality treatments and the development ofnew agents such as doxorubicin and tamoxifen.
1) Several bis-substituted anthraquinones were introduced into clinical trials about 5 years ago asan entirely new class of anticancer agents. 
2) Dihydroxyanthracenedione(mitoxantrone) hasemerged as the most promising of this group ofagents. 
3) This is the finalreport of that study.
4) All patientsgranted written consent after being informed of the experimentalnature of the therapies. 
5) They were then randomized to receiveeither doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) or mitoxantrone (12 mg/m2) asinitial treatment. 
6) Doses wererepeated every 3 weeks and increased by 25% until the patientachieved a WBC nadir of 5 2,500//L. 
7) Increasingshortness of breath in the presence of a changing and abnormalgated acquisition (MUGA) scan (< 0.50) or systolic timeinterval (STI) measurements (AD _ 28%) or a physician'sclinical diagnosis of probable congestive heart failure (CHF)were designated as drug-related CHF. 
8) Either MUGA scans orSTI measurements were scheduled before therapy, at least everythree courses, and at crossover. 
9) Partial response required a 50% decrease in all lesionsthat persisted for at least one full course of therapy. 
10) Completerelief of pain in the absence of analgesics for at least 4 weeks wasaccepted as a partial response if the pain was clearly cancerrelated and had initially required analgesic therapy for relief. 
11) We have chosen to use pain as a response endpoint since palliation is an important goal in this setting and therandomized design helps alleviate bias that might result fromusing subjective end points. 
12) Response determinationswere initially made by the patient's physician and a researchnurse. 
13) They were then confirmed by at least one of the investigatorsin a blinded review of response data. 
14) RESULTSPatient characteristics are presented in Table1. 
15) The response rate to primary treatmentfor all eligible patients was 30% with doxorubicinand 17% with mitoxantrone. 
16) One patienthad a complete response to each agent. 
17) The95% confidence intervals overlapped, and thedifferences were not statistically significant (P <.2). 
18) Seven of 46 patients whoreceived either agent as secondary therapy (aftercrossover) had a response. 
19) Again the response rates (mitoxantrone, 21%, doxorubicin, 10%)were not significantly different for the twoagents. 
20) Responses lasted for about 3months in most patients but continued for morethan a year in some.
21) Nauseaand vomiting (P < .001), alopecia (P < .001),and fatigue (P < .05) occurred less frequently asa result of treatment with mitoxantrone and tendedto be less severe. 
22) DISCUSSIONThis study was designed to determine comparativeresponse rates, response durations, andside effects of mitoxantrone and doxorubicin inpatients with breast cancer who had failed therapywith CMF. 
23) The complete and partial response rates tothese agents are similar, and observed differencesare not statistically significant. 
24) TheEastern Cooperative group used a dosage of 4mg/m 2/d for 3 days every 3 weeks on patients forwhom one prior chemotherapy regimen' 2 hadfailed, they have observed only two partial responsesin 34 patients (6%). 
25) Mitoxantrone hasshown reproducible but modest efficacy as a single agent in the doses and schedules used in thesestudies. 
26) Seven of 46 patients (15%) respondedto one agent after having failed to respond tothe other.
27) Alopecia to a degree that isbothersome for the patient is unusual, althoughsome hair loss is seen in one third of the patientstreated with mitoxantrone.
