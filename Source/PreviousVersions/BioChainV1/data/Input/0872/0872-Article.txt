Cardioprotection With Dexrazoxane for Doxorubicin Containing Therapy in Advanced Breast Cancer

Purpose: To determine the cardioprotective effect of
dexrazoxane (DZR) used in a doxorubicin-based combination
therapy in advanced breast cancer.
Patients and Methods: Between November 1988 and
January 1991, 534 patients with advanced breast cancer
were randomized to two multicenter, double-blind studies
(088001 and 088006). Patients received fluorouracil,
doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) with either
DZR (DZR-to-doxorubicin ratio, 10:1) or placebo (PLA)
every 3 weeks and were monitored with serial multiplegated
acquisition (MUGA) scans.
Results: The hazards ratio (HR) of PLA to DZR for a
carci-c event, which was predefined ejection fraction
changes or congestive heart failure (CHF), was 2.63
(95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.61 to 4.27; P < .001) for
088001 and 2.00 (95% CI, 1.01 to 3.96; P = .038) for
088006. The objective response rates for 088001 were
46.8% for DZR and 60.5% for PLA, a difference of 14%
(95% Cl, -25% to -2%; P = .019), and for 088006 were
53.7% for DZR and 49.3% for PLA, a difference of 4%
(95% CI, -13% to 22%; P = .63). Time to progression
and survival were not significantly different between
treatment arms in either study. Toxicities on the DZR
arms included lower granulocyte and platelet counts at
nadir (P = .009 and P = .004, respectively) and more
pain on injection (P = .001), with no difference in the
rates of fever, infection, or hemorrhage.
Conclusion: DZR had a significant cardioprotective effect
as measured by noninvasive testing and clinical CHF.
One of the two studies (088001) showed a lower response
rate with DZR, but time to progression and survival
were not significantly different. DZR is the first
agent shown to reduce cardiotoxicity from doxorubicin.
THE ROLE OF DOXORUBICIN (Adriamycin; Pharmacia
& Upjohn, Inc, Kalamazoo, MI) for the treatment
of women with metastatic breast cancer is clearly
established. It is the most active single agent for this
disease' and, when used in combination chemotherapy,
has been shown to produce response rates that range from
55% to 82%.2 It has been suggested that continuous treatment
for advanced breast cancer compared with intermittent
treatment improves quality of life. However, the
ability to continue to administer doxorubicin to patients
who have responded is limited by cardiotoxicity associated
with increasing cumulative doses.4 Retrospective
analyses indicates that the probability of developing congestive
heart failure (CHF) increases from 0% to 3% at
total cumulative doses of 400 mg/m2 , and to 18% to 31%
at doses greater than 600 mg/m2.4 -5
Reported risk factors for the development of doxorubicin
cardiotoxicity include prior radiation therapy to the
heart, age. and a history of heart disease. Therefore,
many patients with metastatic breast cancer who might
potentially benefit from treatment with doxorubicin have
been categorized as being at high risk for developing
cardiotoxicity and are excluded from treatment.
In two retrospective analyses, the mortality rate of
doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy ranged from 43%
to 59%, when no prospective monitoring for cardiotoxicity
was used. However, in a large retrospective analysis
reported by Schwartz et al, who used serial resting radionuclide
angiography with guidelines established for monitoring
patients, the incidence, severity, and morbidity of
clinical CHF were reduced in patients at high risk for
cardiomyopathy. Although Schwartz et al showed a 16% incidence of CHF in high-risk patients, 87% of the CHF
patients improved with medical therapy. Therefore, these
established guidelines identified patients who could receive
and tolerate higher doses of doxorubicin. This study
demonstrated that empiric discontinuation of doxorubicin
at a specified dose may not have been necessary. Other
studies have shown that following doxorubicin administration,
a decrease in resting left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF), in either absolute value or magnitude, was
the strongest predictor of clinical cardiotoxicity. Also,
studies have shown that sequential radionuclide testing
results in serial assessments of LVEF that are reproducible
with a low intrinsic variability.
The use of doxorubicin in different schedules to alleviate
cardiotoxicity has also been evaluated. Both a weekly
schedule and continuous infusion were associated
with a significantly lower incidence of cardiotoxicity,
which suggests an association with lower peak plasma
levels. Other methods studied to decrease cardiotoxicity
include the use of anthracycline analogs and liposomeencapsulated
doxorubicin.
Further attempts to decrease cardiotoxicity are based
on a mechanistic approach. Myers et al found that the
cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin is related to anthracycline-
derived free-radical formation. Originally
synthesized for its antitumor effects,'s dexrazoxane
(DZR, ADR-529, ICRF-187, NSC 169780; Zinecard,
Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc) has been shown to reduce the
cardiotoxicity produced in animals by anthracyclines such
as doxorubicin. DZR is a bis-dioxopiperazine compound
that is hydrolyzed to form a chelating agent similar
in structure to EDTA. It is intracellularly hydrolyzed to
its open-ring chelating form, which complexes with iron
and thereby inhibits the generation of free radicals. DZR
does not interfere with the antitumor effect of doxorubicin
against the MX-I human breast tumor line at dose ratios
up to 20:1.
In a prospective randomized trial, DZR was shown
to have a protective effect against doxorubicin-induced
cardiotoxicity in women with metastatic carcinoma of the
breast. Also, DZR did not alter the rate of response to
doxorubicin or increase the toxicity of the regimen. To
verify the results of this initial randomized trial, two
multicenter, double-blind, randomized, phase III trials
were initiated (designated 088001 and 088006). The primary
objective was to confirm the cardioprotective effect
of DZR when used in a doxorubicin-based combination
regimen in patients with advanced breast cancer. Additional
objectives of these studies were to determine if
DZR altered antitumor efficacy and to assess the safety
of the combination of DZR with fluorouracil, doxorubicin,
and cyclophosphamide (FAC). PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Female patients 2 18 years of age who had histologically confirmed
stage IIIB or IV carcinoma of the breast were eligible for
studies 088001 and 088006, activated in February 1988 and May
1989, respectively. Patients who had previously received chemotherapy
were not eligible unless they had completed adjuvant chemotherapy
that did not include an anthracycline or an anthracene at least
6 months before study entry. Patients must have discontinued hormonal
therapy more than 1 week or completed radiation therapy
more than 4 weeks before study entry. In the original protocol for
study 088001, patients were required to have bidimensional measurable
disease, but this was modified in April 1989 to include patients
with nonmeasurable, but assessable disease. Study 088006 included
patients with nonmeasurable disease from the onset.
Patients were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG)24 performance status of 0 to 2 and adequate hematologic
(WBC count 4 x 109/L or granulocyte count 2 1.9 X
109/L, and platelet count 2 100 x 109/L), renal (serum creatinine
concentration 5 2.0 mg/dL), and hepatic (bilirubin concentration c
2.0 mg/dL) functions. Patients were required to have an LVEF at
or above the lower limit of normal (LLN) percentage for the participating
institution, obtained within 4 weeks before study entry. Patients
with a documented history of CHF or cardiomyopathy, current
arrhythmia, or myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months before
entry were excluded. Written informed consent was required for all
patients.
Study Design
Each patient was assigned to a treatment arm according to a
prospectively prepared randomization list. A separate list was prepared
for each investigational site. Within each site, the assignments
were stratified relative to the presence or absence of cardiac risk
factors. They were also stratified on the basis of measurable versus
nonmeasurable disease. Hence, within each site, four sets of codes
were prepared, one for each stratum. The random sequence of codes
within each of the four strata was restricted to a block size of four.
All assignments to treatment and subsequent clinical assessments
were made under double-blind conditions.
In study 088001, patients were initially stratified (in February
1988) within each center as to the presence or absence of one or more
cardiac risk factors. These factors were defined as prior mediastinal
irradiation, age greater than 65 years, history of heart disease (ie,
previous MI, significant arrhythmia, or angina), hypertension or diabetes
mellitus that required medical treatment, and a baseline LVEF
0% to 10% above the LLN for the institution. In April 1989, disease
measurability was added as a second stratification variable. Study
088006 began in May 1989 and both cardiac risk factors and disease
measurability versus nonmeasurability were included m the stratification.
A Safety and Data Monitoring Committee composed of external
investigators (medical oncologists, an ethicist, and a biostatistician)
was established to provide an independent review of the safety profiles
of the trials. In November 1990, this committee recommended
that the studies be amended because of an excess of cases of cardiotoxicity
on the placebo (PLA) arm in both studies. Therefore, after
January 14, 1991, patients who were randomized to either arm of
the studies and had received a cumulative dose of at least 300 mg/
m2 of doxorubicin subsequently received open-label DZR. Drug Treatment
Chemotherapy consisted of 500 mg/m2 fluorouracil, 50 mg/m2
doxorubicin, and 500 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide, which were administered
intravenously (IV) on the first day of each treatment course
DZR or PLA, designated as the blinded study drug, was administered
in a volume of 50 mL/m2 (10:1 ratio of study drug to doxorubicin)
by slow IV push or rapid-drip IV infusion. The placebo control
contained 150 mg of lactose and 50 mg mannitol (United States
Pharmacopeia) lyophilized to form a pellet that resembled DZR. The
blinded study drug was administered between 15 and 30 minutes
before doxorublcin. Treatment was repeated every 3 weeks, provided
recovery from toxicity had occurred.
In study 088001, the initial dose ratio of the blinded study drug
(DZR or PLA) to doxorubicin was 20:1 (DZR 1,000 mg/m2). During
the first 9 months of the study, six deaths occurred on the DZR arm
of 088001; five deaths occurred on the DZR arm of a parallel study
(088002, a small-cell lung cancer study using a 20:1 dose). During
this interval, there was one death on the PLA arm of study 088002.
Because of this imbalance, the ratio of study drug to doxorubicin was
reduced to 10:1 (DZR 500 mg/m 2) in November 1988. Throughout
study 088006, the dose ratio of study drug to doxorubicin was 10:1.
Dose Modifications
A computer-based expert system was developed to ensure compliance
with scheduled evaluations and dose modifications. The investigator
transmitted specified data by facsimile to a central data site at
the time of a patient's registration in the study and before each
course of therapy. A computer-generated program calculated the
patient's body-surface area and recommended initial doses, dates for
future treatments, and dose modifications or delays based on the
toxicity observed for each course Toxicity was graded using ECOG
guidelines. 24 In addition, follow-up tests were recommended at the
appropriate times. This information was transmitted back to the investigator
by facsimile.
Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity were allowed for
fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide, but were not permitted for doxorubicin
or DZR. Treatment was delayed for 7 days if on day 22 the
granulocyte count was less than 1.5 x 109/L or the platelet count
less than 90 x 109/L. The doses of fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide
were reduced by 100 mg/m2 if the absolute neutrophil count
(ANC) was less than 500 cells/pL and fever occurred during a
course, if the day-22 granulocyte count was less than 1.5 x 109/L,
or if the day-22 platelet count was less than 90 x 109 /L. Subsequent
doses of fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide were reduced by 50
mg/m2 . Dose reductions for other toxicities were not permitted. A
dose delay was defined as a period of at least 28 days since the
previous cycle of treatment. The studies had no predetermined cumulative
dose for discontinuation of doxorublcin.
Monitoring
Patients received a baseline evaluation before the start of treatment,
including a history and physical examination, tumor measurements,
chest radiograph, complete blood cell (CBC) count, and serum
chemistries. CBC counts were repeated weekly following
courses I through 4, and subsequently before each course. Physical
examinations, tumor measurements, chest radiographs, and serum
chemistries were repeated after every third course. Cardiac evaluation
included baseline physical examination, ECG, and determination
of the resting LVEF by multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) nuclear scan. MUGAs were to be repeated on the same equipment after
administration of cumulative doxorubicin doses of 150, 300, 400,
and 500 mg/m2, and then after every dose of 50 mg/m2.
Off-Study Criteria
Patients were removed from the study if they developed progressive
disease, a cardiac event, or other toxicity that precluded further
treatment. Cardiac events were defined as a decline in LVEF from
baseline of 2 10% below the institution's LLN, a decline in LVEF
of at least 20% from baseline, a decline in LVEF to at least 5%
below the institution's LLN, or the development of CHF while on
study with two or more of the following: cardiomegaly established
by radiography, basilar rales, S3 gallop, or paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnea, orthopnea, or significant dyspnea on exertion. There was
no predetermined cumulative stopping dose of doxorubicin.
The case report forms of patients reported to have CHF on or off
study by December 31, 1993 were independently evaluated by a
referee cardiologist who was blinded to the treatment arm the patient
had received. Based on the patient's clinical manifestations and the
LVEF levels, the reviewer made a determination of whether, and in
which course, CHF occurred.
Assessment of Tumor Response
Tumor response was assessed using standard ECOG criteria.24
Complete response (CR) was defined as the complete disappearance
of all evidence of tumor; partial response (PR) as 50% decrease
in the sum of the products of two perpendicular diameters of all
measurable disease compared with baseline and no new disease
activity; stable disease (SD) as a less than 50% decrease in measurable
disease (sum of bidimensional products) or less than 25% increase
in measurable disease over baseline measurements and no
new lesions; and progressive disease (PD) as 2 25% increase of
measurable disease (sum of bidimensional products) over baseline,
new lesions, or unequivocal progression of nonmeasurable disease.
Complete regression of bone disease was defined as remineralization
of all lytic lesions or disappearance of all areas of positive uptake
on bone scan; partial regression was defined as remineralization of
2 50% of lytic lesions without an increase in size of any lytic lesion
or the appearance of new lesions. SD was defined as remineralization
of less than 50% of lytic lesions and no new lesions, and PD as a
measurable increase in size of any lytic lesions or the appearance
of new lesions. Blastic bone disease was not considered measurable
and was not used to determine response.
Statistical Analysis
The analyses presented in this report focus on 534 patients (349
on study 088001 and 185 on study 088006) who received the 10:1
dose ratio of DZR or PLA to doxorubicin and were randomized
before January 14, 1991. The 53 patients on the PLA arm who were
still receiving treatment on January 14, 1991 and crossed over to
open-label DZR were not censored after crossing over. P values c
.05 were considered to be significant, and P values greater than .05
but .10 were considered to be of borderline significance. All
analyses performed were intent-to-treat analyses. The cut off date
for these analyses was December 31, 1993.
For patients in the DZR and PLA groups, the cumulative doxorubicin
dose at cardiac event was plotted using Kaplan-Meier curves
and the doses were compared using the log-rank and generalized
Wilcoxon tests. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to
estimate the hazards ratio (HR), which indicates the overall risk of patients on the PLA arm who experienced an event relative to a
patient on the DZR arm. An HR greater than 1.0 means an event is
less likely on the DZR arm, whereas an HR less than 1.0 means an
event is less likely on the PLA arm. Patients who discontinued
treatment without experiencing any of the four cardiac events were
censored at the cumulative dose received when they went off treatment.
A Cox proportional hazards model was also used to compare
the two groups after controlling for six cardiac risk factors based
on the Wald x2 test.
The study was designed so that if the true HR of doxorubicin
dose at cardiac event was 3.0 in favor of the DZR group, the power
to detect this difference would be .80 using a one-sided log-rank
test, setting the alpha level at .05. This required that 24 cardiac
events occur. There were 82 cardiac events in study 088001 and 43
in study 088006.
Objective response rates (CRs and PRs) were compared using the
Pearson X2 test in patients on the two arms with bidimensional
measurable disease. Patients whose best response was SD or PD, as
well as those who were not assessed before going off treatment,
were considered to be treatment failures.
The time to disease progression and survival were plotted using
Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using both the log-rank and the
generalized Wilcoxon tests. The Cox proportional hazards model
was used to estimate the HR both for time to progression and for
survival, both before and after controlling for three prognostic factors.
Time to progression was defined as the time from randomization
to progression either on or off treatment. Patients were censored if
they had no disease progression as of their last known follow-up
visit or if they had died without disease progression. Survival was
defined as the time from randomization to death, and patients who
had not died were censored at their last known date alive.
Noncardlac toxicities, including hematologic and nonhematologic
toxicities, were separately tabulated for each study. The PLA and
DZR groups were compared by stratifying by study and using either
the blocked Wilcoxon or Mantel-Haenszel test.
RESULTS
Between February 1988 and December 1992, a total of
682 patients from 53 institutions entered study 088001 and
were randomized to receive FAC plus DZR or FAC plus
PLA. Between May 1989 and December 1992, 326 patients
from 65 institutions entered study 088006 and were randomized
to receive FAC plus DZR or FAC plus PLA.
Table 1 lists all patients randomized onto the two studies.
They include patients randomized to the 20:1 dose ratio (study drug to doxorubicin) before the dose change.
These patients received one or more cycles at the 20:1
dose ratio. Also included are the patients who received
the 10:1 dose ratio (study drug to doxorubicin) randomized
before the amendment on January 14, 1991, and
those randomized after that date.
The analyses presented in this report include only the
534 patients who received the 10:1 dose ratio randomized
before January 14, 1991. This was to ensure a homogenous
population of patients, since the dose and design of
the trial were changed during the course of the studies.
There were 349 patients on study 088001 and 185 on
study 088006. The median follow-up time on study
088001 was 532 days (range, 1 to 1,863) for the 168
patients who received DZR and 511 days (range, 1 to
1,652) for the 181 patients who received PLA. The median
follow-up time on study 088006 was 397 days
(range, 6 to 1,393) for the 81 patients who received DZR
and 517 days (range, 29 to 1,429) for the 104 patients
who received PLA.
There were nine patients (four on study 088001 and
five on study 088006) randomized and not treated. All
but one are included in the analyses. The patient not
included had insufficient data for randomization and was
inadvertently randomized. The reasons for no treatment
in the other eight patients are patient refusal in four,
physician decision in one, pain that required radiation in
one, study drug not available at site in one, and patient
not eligible for study in one (protocol violation for entry
criteria). There were 34 patients taken off studies 088001
and 088006 for protocol violations, including one patient
who was never treated. There were eight on the DZR arm
and 15 on the PLA arm in study 088001, and six on the
DZR arm and five on the PLA arm in study 088006.
Reasons for protocol violations included ineligibility for
study entry (n = 8); study drug scheduling, recording, or
dosing problems (n = 18); ejection fraction changes that
did not fulfill criteria for cardiac event, but patient taken
off study by investigator (n = 7); and an 8-week treatment
delay (n = 1).
Disease characteristics for these 534 patients randomized
before January 14, 1991 and who received a 10:1
dose on studies 088001 and 088006 are listed in Table
2. The treatment groups were well balanced for all patient
characteristics. Cardiac risk factors for these patients were
also well balanced and are listed in Table 3. Investigators
were requested to indicate on the case report forms
whether mediastinal irradiation had been administered.
However, review of these forms indicated that the information
largely consisted of patients who received either
right and left chest-wall irradiation only and who there

fore may not have actually received mediastinal irradiation.
Cardioprotection
Table 4 displays the number of patients who experienced
a cardiac event, while Fig 1A and B shows Kaplan-
Meier curves comparing the DZR and PLA patients with
regard to cumulative doxorubicin dose to cardiac event.
In study 088001, 15% of DZR patients and 31% of PLA
patients experienced a cardiac event, whereas in study
088006, these proportions were 14% and 31%. The HR of
PLA to DZR in study 088001 was 2.63 (95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.61 to 4.27), which indicates the overall risk of having a cardiac event was over 2.5 times as great
for patients who did not receive DZR. The log-rank test
showed this difference between groups to be highly statistically
significant (P < .001), but the generalized Wilcoxon
test indicated borderline significance (P = .068).
In study 088006, the HR was 2.00 (95% CI, 1.01 to 3.96)
and was statistically significant according to the log-rank
test (P = .038), but not statistically significant according
to the generalized Wilcoxon test (P = .42). The difference
between the results analyzed by the log-rank test and
those analyzed by the generalized Wilcoxon test was due
to the emphasis of the generalized Wilcoxon test on
events that occur early in the study. Although there was 

little difference between the two groups at cumulative doses up to 400 to 500 mg/m2, there was a substantial difference between these two groups at cumulative doses above this level. The HR of PLA to DZR in study 088001, adjusted for six cardiac risk covariables (age, diabetes mellitus, history ofcardiovascular disease, hypertension, prior mediastinal irradiation, and LVEF within 10% of the institution's LLN), was 2.84 (95% CI, 1.71 to 4.71; P < .001, Wald X2 test). The HR for study 088006, adjusted for these six covariables, was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.06 to 4.33; P = .034, Wald X2 test). Because of the small number of cases of CHF, both studies are considered together. Table 4 shows that 24 patients from both studies (16 on study 088001 and eight on study 088006) developed CHF either on or off study. Two of these patients were randomized to receive DZR and 22 to PLA. Five of these patients were alive, and in follow-up evaluation, 11 died of PD, three died of unknown causes, one died of a cerebrovascular accident, two died of CHF, and two died of PD with CHF. The two patients (one on study 088001 and one on study 088006) who died of CHF were on the PLA arm and had received 450 mg/m2 and 500 mg/m2 of doxorubicin. The two patients who died of PD with severe CHF were on PLA arms and had received 400 mg/m 2 and 550 mg/m2 of doxorubicin. Compliance with the performance of required MUGA scans was evaluated. In study 088001, 1,494 scans were performed and the compliance rate was 92% and 91% of the required tests in the PLA and DZR groups, respectively. In study 088006, 821 scans were performed and the compliance rate was 90% and 88% in the PLA and DZR groups, respectively. Response Rate Results of the initial review of objective response rates (CRs and PRs) for patients with bidimensional measurable disease demonstrated a significantly higher objective response rate in patients on study 088001 who received PLA (63%) than in those who received DZR (48%) (P = .007, Pearson x2 test). Response rates were not significantly different in study 088006. These responses were obtained by reviewers who were blinded to the treatment and used clinical judgment along with response criteria
to obtain results. A second review of all response rates
was performed by using only strict written response criteria
with the reviewers again blinded to the treatment arms.
The results did not substantially change. All patients with
measurable disease who were enrolled onto studies
088001 and 088006 and who received a 10:1 dose are
listed in Table 5. The objective response rates for study
088001 were 46.8% for DZR and 60.5% for PLA,
whereas for study 088006 they were 53.7% for DZR and
49.3% for PLA. The differences between the objective
response rates in the DZR and PLA arm were -14% (95% CI, -25% to -2%; P = .019) in study 088001 and
4% (95% CI, -13% to 22%; P = .63) in study 088006.
The response rate for patients on study 088001 who
had received prior chemotherapy was 41% on the DZR
arm versus 58% on the PLA arm, a difference of 17%
(95% CI, -36% to 2%; P = .072), and for patients who
had received prior hormonal therapy was 45% for the
DZR arm and 61% for the PLA arm, a difference of 16%
(95% CI, -33% to 1%; P = .065). Response rates for
patients on study 088006 who had received previous chemotherapy
for the DZR arm were 53% and for the PLA
arm were 52%, a difference of 1% (95% CI, -30% to 32%; P = .95), and for previous hormonal therapy for
the DZR arm were 44% and for the PLA arm were 53%,
a difference of 9% (95% CI, -35% to 17%; P = .50).
Time to Progression and Survival
Figure 2A presents Kaplan-Meier curves comparing
the DZR and PLA groups in study 088001 with regard
to time to PD. The HR of PLA to DZR was 0.86 (95%
CI, 0.68 to 1.10). The difference between groups was not
statistically significant according to the log-rank test (P
= .23), but was of borderline significance according to
the generalized Wilcoxon test (P = .10). The median time
to progression was 254 days for patients in the DZR arm
and 260 days for patients in the PLA arm. The difference
in time to progression between treatment arms after controlling
for three prognostic factors (prior chemotherapy,
number of disease sites, and disease measurability) was
not statistically significant.
Figure 2B is similar to Fig 2A, but presents the time
to progression data in study 088006. The HR was 0.83
(95% CI, 0.60 to 1.15). The difference between groups
was not statistically significant according to either the
log-rank or the generalized Wilcoxon test (P = .27 and
P = .45, respectively). The median time to progression
was 233 and 249 days in the DZR and PLA arms, respectively.
The difference was not statistically significant after
controlling for the three prognostic factors listed earlier.
The time to progression for patients who had received
previous chemotherapy and that for patients who had received
prior hormonal therapy were not significantly different
between treatment arms for either study 088001 or
088006. This was the case when either the log-rank or
generalized Wilcoxon test was used.
Survival curves are shown in Fig 3A and B. The HRs
were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.80 to 1.31) and 0.82 (95% CI. 0.59 to 1.14) in studies 088001 and 088006. No statistically
significant differences between groups were found using
either the log-rank or the generalized Wilcoxon test in
study 088001 (P = .88 and P = .94) and in study 088006
(P = .23 and P = .13). The median survival time in study
088001 was 598 days in the DZR arm and 551 in the
PLA arm, whereas in study 088006 it was 458 days and
553 days, respectively. The differences were not significant
in either study after controlling for the previously
listed prognostic factors.
Dose Modification
Beginning with cycle 2 and ending with cycle 7, the
proportion of cycles with dose reductions (doses of fluorouracil
and cyclophosphamide < 500 mg/m2) or delays
(at least 28 days since previous cycle) for patients in each
arm of both studies is listed in Table 6; there were no
significant differences between arms. When dose reductions
and dose delays were analyzed separately, there
were still no significant differences between arms. In addition,
there was no significant difference in the median
number of cycles received per treatment arm in either
study; the median number for each arm was six.
Noncardiac Toxicity
Patients who received DZR and patients who received
PLA in both studies were compared with regard to their
highest toxicity grade experienced during courses before
crossover to open-label DZR. Toxicities were separately
analyzed for each study and yielded essentially the same
results as a combined analysis. Therefore, the toxicity
data are presented as a combination of both studies.
With regard to hematologic toxicity, WBC count was
significantly lower at nadir (days 1 to 18) on the DZR
arms (P = .012) and was characterized for the majority of patients as grades 3 and 4 toxicity. Granulocyte counts
were significantly lower at nadir for the patients on the
DZR arms (P = .009). This was largely due to grade 4
granulocytopenia, which occurred in 75% of patients on
the DZR arms and 64% of those on the PLA arms. Lower
WBC and granulocyte counts at recovery (days 19 to 25)
for patients on the PLA arm were of at least borderline
significance (P = .072 and P = .030, respectively). Platelet
counts at nadir were significantly lower for the DZR
arms (P = .004), but the differences consisted largely of
grade 1 toxicity. Patients on the DZR arms had a 47%
incidence of grade 1 thrombocytopenia, whereas patients
on the PLA arms had a 29% incidence. Differences in the higher grades (2, 3, and 4) were minor. Platelet counts
at recovery were significantly lower for the patients on
the PLA arms (P = .003), and the differences consisted
mostly of grade 1 toxicity. The change in hemoglobin
value from baseline was not different between treatment
arms in either study. There were no differences between
treatment arms in the incidence of hemorrhage, fever,
sepsis, or infection.
For nonhematologic toxicities, pain on injection was more
frequent and severe on the DZR arms than on the PLA
arms (P = .001), but the difference was mainly in grades
1 or 2. Nausea and vomiting were significantly more severe
on the PLA arm (P = .024 and P = .003, respectively). There were some differences of borderline statistical significance:
stomatitis and esophagitis were more severe on
the PLA arm (P = .071 and P = .087, respectively). There
were no statistically significant differences between the DZR
and PLA arms in serum chemistry findings.
A comparison of the percentage of patients who experienced
either grade 3 or 4 toxicity during any course prior
to open-label DZR is listed in Table 7 for each study individually
and in combination. The only significant finding was
a lower WBC nadir for patients who received DZR.
Thirty-five of 534 patients (6.6%) on both studies were
withdrawn because of noncardiac adverse experiences. Seventeen
of 249 patients (6.8%) were on the DZR arms and 18 of 285 patients (6.3%) were on the PLA arms. Twenty
of 534 patients (3.7%) died while on study. Eight of 249
(3.2%) were on the DZR arms and 12 of 285 (4.2%) were
on the PLA arms. Eleven (55%) of these deaths were due
to PD (four on DZR arms and seven on PLA arms), two
(10%) to neutropenic sepsis (two on DZR arms), three
(15%) possibly to treatment (three on PLA arms), and four
(20%) to other non-treatment-related causes (two on DZR
arms and two on PLA arms).
DISCUSSION
The results reported here from these two placebo-controlled
prospective randomized studies confirm the 

cardioprotective effect of DZR in patients with advanced breast cancer treated with doxorubicin in combination with fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide. Because early analysis of these studies uncovered evidence of significant cardioprotection, in January 1991, patients on the PLA arm received open-label DZR starting with their seventh course or a cumulative dose of 300 mg/m 2 doxorubicin. Results of the analysis of patients who received DZR after 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin show significant cardioprotection without impairment of antitumor efficacy compared with patients who never received DZR and are presented in another report.25 A previous large nonblinded, randomized clinical trial that compared FAC and DZR with FAC alone showed that DZR permitted breast cancer patients to receive significantly more cycles and higher cumulative doses of on the DZR arm, as measured by serial MUGA scans

doxorubicin. Cardiotoxicity was significantly lower

and endomyocardial biopsies. Cumulative doxorubicin doses - 1,000 mg/m2 were given to 14% of patients randomized to receive DZR, without cardiotoxicity. There were no differences in objective response rates or noncardiac toxicity between treatment arms. Progression-free survival and overall survival were not different, although this study was not designed to test antitumor efficacy. The current reported studies were designed to test the hypothesis that DZR reduces doxorubicin-associated cardiotoxicity. Cardioprotection evaluated prospectively by frequent MUGA scans was significantly related to the use of DZR in both studies. The likelihood of developing a cardiac event was 2.0 to 2.6 times greater without the addition of DZR. The most substantial cardioprotective effect was seen at the higher cumulative doses. The majority of cardiac events were changes in LVEF and not CHF, although 4.5% of patients who entered studies 088001 and 088006 developed CHF secondary to doxorubicin treatment. However, 1% of the patients on the DZR
arms developed CHF compared with 8% on the PLA
arms. Fifty percent of patients who developed CHF did
so after treatment had ended. Even though the use of
DZR reduces doxorubicin-associated toxicity, it should
also be noted that 14% of patients in this report who
received DZR did experience a cardiac event and were
taken off the study. However, most of these patients did
not develop clinical CHF. Because DZR does not provide
absolute cardioprotection, patients need to be monitored
prospectively by noninvasive testing.
Because measurements of LVEF were used to define
a cardiac event, the issue of compliance with obtaining
MUGA scans was addressed. Investigators obtained required
scheduled scans at least 88% of the prescribed
times. This is extremely important, because scans were
required every cycle after a cumulative dose of 500 mg/
m2 of doxorubicin. It is possible that some patients who
had laboratory evidence of cardiotoxicity were missed,
but, if so, this number was small.
There is some evidence of interference with antitumor
efficacy in patients who receive DZR, as measured by
response rates in the larger study. The lower response
rate in trial 088001 could not be explained by the administration
of decreased chemotherapy doses or imbalances
in patient characteristics. Also, in specifically evaluating
responses in patients who had received previous chemotherapy
or patients who had received previous hormonal
therapy, the difference in response rates was of borderline
significance. However, the lower response rate in the patients
who received DZR did not translate into a significant
decrease in time to progression or survival.
Although study 088001 shows a lower response rate
with DZR, no other data support this result. Preclinical
data do not show a reduced antitumor effect. In addition,
the randomized study previously discussed and a
study that used DZR with epirubicin did not show any
interference with antitumor efficacy. This question of interference
may never be answered fully in the setting of
metastatic breast cancer, since a repeat randomized clinical
trial to evaluate the use of DZR with the initiation of
therapy is unlikely to be performed. Potential interference
with antitumor efficacy may be more germane to the
adjuvant use of DZR. It is a more difficult problem because
tumor response rates cannot be used as surrogate
markers for treatment efficacy. Because a definite survival
benefit is seen with anthracycline-containing adjuvant
therapy in subsets of patients, extreme caution must be
used before an agent that may decrease tumor responsiveness
is included. There are other avenues of research designed to decrease
doxorubicin-related cardiotoxicity; some have been reported
and others are in progress. In a randomized study of sarcoma
patients, doxorubicin administered as a 96-hour continuous
infusion, rather than as a bolus, has been shown to decrease
cardiotoxicity (P = .04). In preclinical models, liposomal
encapsulation of doxorubicin has been shown to decrease
cardiotoxicity. Phase I studies of liposomal doxorubicin
have shown a different toxicity profile, with hand-foot syndrome
and stomatitis found to be the dose-limiting toxicities.
36 The hypothesis is that liposomal doxorubicin may
have a slow-release effect, similar to that of continuous
infusion. A recent report suggests that probucol, a lipidlowering
agent with antioxidant properties, protects against
doxorubicin-associated cardiomyopathy in rats. The use of
both liposomal doxorubicin and probucol in phase II studies
will provide more evidence regarding cardioprotection and
antitumor efficacy.
An issue relevant to the current reports involves the
utility of treating patients with doxorubicin therapy until
disease progression. Three reports have compared
intermittent and continuous therapy for advanced breast
cancer. The first study found quality of life and time
to progression were significantly improved in patients
who received continuous therapy. The second trial
treated patients with six cycles of cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) then randomized
them to receive cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and
fluorouracil (CMF) or observation.3 8 The median time
to progression was shorter for patients randomized to
the observation arm (P < .001), but survival times were
equivalent. Toxicity was greater in the continuous arm,
and some patients requested cessation of therapy. The
conclusions were that if patients waited to stop therapy,
survival would not be affected. However, chemotherapy
may prolong time to progression and therefore
reduce tumor-related symptoms. Finally, a small randomized
study compared short-term and continuous
mitoxantrone and resulted in no difference in time to
progression, response duration, or survival between the
two groups. In conclusion, two of these studies support
continuous treatment with resultant longer time to
progression. However, the quality-of-life issues are less
clear, with somewhat opposing results. Therefore, since
patients with advanced breast cancer are not cured,
but certainly can benefit from treatment, the issue of
continuing treatment indefinitely is still open. The net
clinical benefit to the patient must be the objective of
future trials.
Future studies of DZR will focus on evaluating the merit
of continuing doxorubicin treatment beyond six courses of 
FAC in breast cancer patients who respond to treatment. 
addition, studies are planned for pediatric patients, patients
with cardiac risk factors, combination studies of doxorubicin 
with other chemotherapy agents and DZR with the initiation 
of therapy, studies with dose-intensified doxorubicin, studies
with anthracyclines other than doxorubicin, and studies in patients with other tumor types.
