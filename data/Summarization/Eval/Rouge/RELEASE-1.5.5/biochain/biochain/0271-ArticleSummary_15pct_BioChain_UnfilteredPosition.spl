MAJOR ADVANCES in breast cancer throughout the past decade have included the widespread introduction of combination and  multimodality treatments and the development of new agents such as doxorubicin and tamoxifen . 
Women with metastatic or unresectable regional breast cancer were eligible for this study if they had received no more than  one prior chemotherapy regimen , they had not received anthracyclines , and their previous therapy had failed .
Patients were considered evaluable for response if they completed two courses of therapy or showed documented disease  progression at any time . 
Two patients were entered on the  mitoxantrone arm and one on doxorubicin without measurable disease and were therefore not eligible . 
Response rates are reported for all eligible patients and  for patients completing two full courses of therapy . 
Table 2 shows the patient response to both primary treatment and secondary treatment (after crossover) .  
The response rate to primary treatment for all eligible patients was 30% with doxorubicin and 17% with mitoxantrone . 
If only patients who received two full courses of therapy are considered , the response  rates to mitoxantrone and doxorubicin are 23% and 33% , respectively .
Again the response rates (mitoxantrone , 21% , doxorubicin , 10%) were not  significantly different for the two agents . 
Overall response rates (primary and secondary treatment) are the same (22% v  25%) .
This study was designed to determine comparative response rates , response durations , and side effects of mitoxantrone and  doxorubicin in patients with breast cancer who had failed therapy with CMF . 
The complete and partial response rates to these agents are similar , and observed  differences are not statistically significant . 
Yap and colleagues reported a 22% overall response rate in 31 patients with  highly refractive breast cancer who were treated with mitoxantrone at a dosage of 4 mg/m 2/d for 5 consecutive days each  month . 
Their response rate was 35% , including six patients showing a complete response . 
We made no formal evaluation of the quality of life in  this study , but the performance status tended to be worse in patients receiving prolonged doxorubicin treatment than in  patients receiving prolonged treatment with mitoxantrone .
