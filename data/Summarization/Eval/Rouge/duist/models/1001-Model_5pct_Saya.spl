The 5-year analysis had shown that a short , albeit intensive , postoperative course of antibody treatment (900 mg total dose)significantly reduced the appearance of distant metastases , but did not affect the rate of local relapses .
For the immediate future , adding antibody to chemotherapy seems logical to attack both dormant , as well as proliferating, metastatic tumor cells .
Here , we report on the 7-year follow-up study of this prospective randomized two-arm trial in minimal residual disease that used the murine 17-1A antibody, 4 which recognizes a 34-kd glycoprotein of the cell membrane ofepithelial cells .
In contrast to other trials aimed at patients with larger metastatic tumor masses and using regression or shrinkage as the end point, this one on colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C required microscopically complete resection of the primary tumor for patients to be admitted .
As the primary end point , overall-survival was determined at 5 years .
After confirmation of histology and R0 resection of lymph node metastasis , patients were randomized into two groups one received 17-lA treatment , whereas the other served as observation controls .
Patients in both groups were monitored in exactly the same way , with 14 prospectively defined follow-up visits , first on a quarterly and later on a half-year basis .
The dose of antibody chosen deserves a special comment
