Our results and those of Browman et al do not support reports of  superiorefficacy for the sequential administration of MTX followed  by 5-FU compared to other drug sequences .
Sequential administration of moderate doses of MTX followed by 5-FU has been reported effective in advanced head and neck cancer and colorectal  cancer , as well as breast cancer , but the importance of the  sequence remains uncertain .
We therefore conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial in  which sequential MTX followed by 5-FU was compared to the same  drugs given in the opposite order .
No significant sequence-dependent differences in response rate or survival duration were observed among the patients with colorectal  cancer .
Both treatment sequences were effective in head and neck cancer ,  producing an overall major response rate (complete and partial) of  46% of all entered patients , including 52% (95% confidence limits , 39%-65%) of evaluable patients .
Survival duration was not significantly different by treatment sequence in univariate analyses , though the trend favored the sequence of 5-FU  before MTX , in which the median survival had not been reached at 23  months , compared to a median survival of 13.3 months in the group  receiving MTX before 5-FU .
Cox model multivariate analysis showed that ECOG performance  status at study entry was the most significant prognostic factor for survival  duration (P < .001) , and that , among the 70 patients with head and neck cancer , when allowance was made for performance status , a survival difference  in favor of the "reverse" FM sequence emerged (P < .025) .
The treatments were well tolerated in most patients , with a low incidence of hematologic and no significant renal toxicity (Table 2) , but  occasionalsevere diarrhea or mucositis occurred , apparently  despite normal renal function and FAR .
In fact , no significant difference was observed between the  toxicities of the two drug sequences (Table 2) , suggesting that neither synergy nor antagonism was displayed in the effects of either sequence on normal tissues .
