As the 7-year median follow-up data confirm the previously reported 5-year findings , the conclusion seems warranted that antibody treatment improves the chances of curatively operated patients .
In conclusion , the presented results still support the original hypothesis that minimal residual disease occurring so frequently in patients with sohd tumors appears to be an indication for antibody therapy .
For the immediate future , adding antibody to chemotherapy seems logical to attack both dormant , as well as proliferating , metastatic tumor cells .
Here , we report on the 7-year follow-up study of this prospective randomized two-arm trial in minimal residual disease that used the murine 17-1A antibody , 4 which recognizes a 34-kd glycoprotein of the cell membrane of epithelial cells .
A total of 189 patients were randomized between May 1985 and April 1990 .
Eligible patients were required to have histologically confirmed adenocarcmoma of colon or the rectum with spread to regional lymph nodes (Dukes' C or International Unimon Agamst Cancer [UICC] stage III) .
After confirmation of histology and R0 resection of lymph node metastasis , patients were randomized into two groups one received 17-lA treatment , whereas the other served as observation controls .
The death rate of the observed group was 63% (48 of 76 , 95% CI , range , 48 to 78) of patients and that of the treated group was 43% (39 of 90 , 95% CI , range , 31 to 58) .
Thus , treatment with antibody led to a relative reduction of mortality by 32% (hazards ratio , 0.57 , 95% confidence interval , 8% to 51%) .
The KaplanMeier survival curves (Fig 1A) showed a significant benefit for patients who received antibody over those who did not receive treatment (P < .01 with Cox's proportional hazard model corrected for influence of prognostic variables , and P = .01 with log-rank test for the univariate analysis) .
Also , the intention-to-treat analysis (Fig B) on all 185 patients showed a significant overall benefit for the treated group (P < .01 with Cox's multivariate analysis , and P = .02 with log-rank test for the univanate analysis) .
When the analyses of recurrence-free interval and recurrence-free survival were performed including all randomized patients , ie , according to intention-to-treat , 17-1A treatment again led to significant advantage over the untreated group (Cox multivanate , P = .02 , log-rank , P = .01 , respectively) .
Antibody treatment increased time to recurrence (P = .04 with Cox proportional hazards model corrected for influence of prognostic variables , and P = .07 with log-rank test for umvanate analysis) .
The reduction in recurrence was 23% (hazards ratio , 0.66 , 95% confidence interval , 1% to 43%) Recurrence-free intervals were plotted according to Kaplan-Maier (Fig 2) .
The calculated recurrence rate was 68% (49 of 76 , 95% CI , range , 53 to 82) m the control group and 52% (47 of 90 , 95% CI , range , 39 to 67) in the 17-1A group .
In summary , 46% of patients (41 of 90) in the treatment group are at nsk at 7 years and only 29% of patients (22 of 76) m the observed group are alive without recurrence .
When the two groups were compared with regard to the site of first recurrence , the 7-year data similar to the 5-year analysis show that significantly fewer distant recurrences occur in patients treated with the antibody than in the control arm (Fig 3) .
Therefore , the proposition is holding up that treatment with 17-1A may preferentially act on isolated tumor cells and thus prevent outgrowth of distant metastases .
As shown in Table 2 , there is an excess of local recurrences in the treatment group , which may partially be explained by the longer survival of treated patients .
The rather mild toxicity of 17-1A antibody has been described in detail in the 5-year report .
Since only acute and no chronic adverse effects were seen , the toxicity profile was not changed during the last observation penod .
When tested for antibody response against murine antibody (HAMA) , 80% of treated patients developed a distinct HAMA response after the second or third infusion .
Patients who developed recurrences and those who remained tumorfree did not show a difference in antibody titers .
