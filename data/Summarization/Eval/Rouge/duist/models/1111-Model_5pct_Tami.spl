Thus , adjunctive radiotherapy is beneficial for Stage I cervical cancer patients with clinical–pathological risk factors for recurrence other than positive nodes .
This conclusion is based on a significant reduction of cancer recurrences in patients in our study and acceptably low morbidity with a single treatment-related fatality .
The present prospective randomized study showed that adjunctive radiotherapy significantly reduced the number of cancer recurrences in women with the above risk factors by 44% and that the difference in recurrences between irradiated and nonirradiated patients was statistically significant at the P 5 0.019 level .
A detailed GOG clinical pathologic study had established that certain patients with poor prognostic factors related to the primary tumor (i.e. , large tumor size , deep stromal invasion , and capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement) but without lymph node involvement had a risk of recurrence of 31% after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy .
In 1988 the GOG initiated a prospective randomized study (GOG #92)  , reported here  , to investigate the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy for Stage I cervical cancer patients treated by conventional radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who were at high risk for recurrence  , because of LTD  , DSI  , CLS  , but excluding patients with lymph node metastases .
Between March 1988 and September 1995  , 299 women were accessioned into the study .
The crude estimate in the reduction in risk in patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy was 47% (i.e.  , relative risk 5 0.53) with the recurrence-free rate of 88% in the radiotherapy group and 79% in the no-further-therapy group at 2 years (Fig. 1) .
Fortyfive (78%) of 58 recurrences were local only (vagina or pelvis)  (Table 4) .
