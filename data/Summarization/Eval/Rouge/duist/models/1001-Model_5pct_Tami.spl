As the 7-year median follow-up data confirm the previously reported 5-year findings , the conclusion seems warranted that antibody treatment improves the chances of curatively operated patients .
In conclusion , the presented results still support the original hypothesis that minimal residual disease occurring so frequently in patients with sohd tumors appears to be an indication for antibody therapy .
For the immediate future , adding antibody to chemotherapy seems logical to attack both dormant , as well as proliferating , metastatic tumor cells .
Here , we report on the 7-year follow-up study of this prospective randomized two-arm trial in minimal residual disease that used the murine 17-1A antibody , 4 which recognizes a 34-kd glycoprotein of the cell membrane of epithelial cells .
A total of 189 patients were randomized between May 1985 and April 1990 .
Eligible patients were required to have histologically confirmed adenocarcmoma of colon or the rectum with spread to regional lymph nodes (Dukes' C or International Unimon Agamst Cancer [UICC] stage III) .
After confirmation of histology and R0 resection of lymph node metastasis , patients were randomized into two groups one received 17-lA treatment , whereas the other served as observation controls .
The death rate of the observed group was 63% (48 of 76 , 95% CI , range , 48 to 78) of patients and that of the treated group was 43% (39 of 90 , 95% CI , range , 31 to 58) .
