The treatment of limb sarcomas mainly relies on a combined-modality approach ,  after the demonstration that pre-or postoperative radiation and conservative surgery led to local control in a high proportion of patients .
In fact ,  limb-sparing procedures allow an 85% to 90% local dis-ease-free survival (DFS) rate and demolitive surgery now represents only 5% to 10% of the operations in comparison with the 50% survival rate of the 1960s to 1970s .
Here we report the results of the Italian co-operative study after a median follow-up of 59 months and a minimum time between randomization and date last seen of 28 months among patients who did not die .
The time of the analysis (November ,  1999) was 36 months after the last randomization .
After a positive biopsy for sarcoma ,  all patients underwent complete staging and programmed local treatment .
Inclusion criteria were as follows ,  age ,  18 to 65 years ,  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2 ,  primary tumors subfascially localized with diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm ,  high-grade spindle-cell or polymorphous sarcomas (fibrosarcoma ,  malignant fibrous histiocytoma ,  polymorphous liposarcoma ,  leiomyosarcoma ,  synovial sarcoma ,  malignant schwannoma ,  angiosarcoma ,  and polymorphous rhabdomyosarcoma) ,  local relapse of any size ,  no previous radio/chemotherapy ,  adequate bone marrow (WBC count of >= 4,000/fiL ,  platelets = 120.000/mL ,  and hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL) ,  renal (creatinine <= 1.3 mg/dL) ,  hepatic (SGOT <= 2.5 X normal value and bilirubin <= 1.2 mg/dL) ,  and pulmonary functions .
Patients were treated with radical surgery ,  wide resection followed by postoperative radiation therapy ,  or pre-operative radiation therapy .
Radical surgery consisted of amputation in case of massive involvement of critical structures or compartmental resection in highly selected patients .
Wide resection followed by postoperative radiation therapy (64 to 66 Gy in 32 to 33 fractions ,  5 fractions per week) was used for patients amenable to conservative surgery with negative margins .
Preoperative radiation therapy (44.8 Gy in 28 fractions in 2.5 weeks ,  160 cGy/ fraction ,  2 fractions per day) followed by resection with or without a post-or intraoperative boost (16 to 18 Gy for positive or close surgical margins) was used for tumors extending to critical structures for which conservative surgical resection was expected to be inadequate and amputation would usually have to be performed to obtain negative margins .
Chemotherapy ,  repeated every 3 weeks ,  consisted of five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin (EPI) 60 mg/m2/die ,  in a short intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1 and 2 (total dose per cycle ,  120 mg/m2) ,  IFO 1.8 g/m2/die diluted in 500 mL of normal saline and administered over 1 hour on days 1 through 5 (total dose per cycle ,  9 g/m2) ,  and 6-mercapto-ethansulfonate in a bolus IV injection at 20% of the IFO dose ,  given before and 4 and 8 hours after the IFO infusions .
On the basis of the estimated proportions of patients free from metastatic disease 2 years after diagnosis (60% in the treated group v 40% in the control group) ,  it was estimated that 95 patients were required per arm (beta = 0.80 ,  alpha = 0.05) .
All centers faxed protocol-specific eligibility checklists to the statistics office in Aviano ,  patients were stratified using a four-block stratification by primary tumor (diameter < 10 cm v >= 10 cm) and recurrent tumor (diameter < 10 cm v >= 10 cm) and randomized to treatment or control groups .
Overall DFS was defined as the time between randomization and the first recurrence ,  and OS was defined as the time between randomization and death as a result of disease (patients dying in complete remission were considered as censored on the date of death for OS) .
Under the auspices of the Italian National Council for Research (CNR) ,  104 patients ,  53 in the chemotherapy and 51 in the control arm ,  entered the study between June ,  1992 and November ,  1996 .
In November ,  1996 ,  the per protocol interim analysis of disease-free survival revealed a significant difference in favor of chemotherapy (P = .001) ,  therefore the accrual was stopped and the data reported .
The present article deals with a minimum observation time of 36 months calculated from the date of randomization of the last patient (11 of 96) .
The data from the first cycle clearly indicate the aggressiveness of the program ,  35% of the patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia ,  and 4% experienced grade 4 thrombocytopenia .
From the third cycle ,  grade 4 leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were less frequent because of the applied dose reductions ,  and anemia became the most important hematologic side effect ,  requiring repeated packed red cell transfusions in 24% of the patients .
Neutropenic fever was also mostly observed after cycles 1 ,  2 ,  and 3 (15 of 16 episodes) ,  with 9% ,  13% ,  and 11% ,  respectively ,  of the patients being admitted to hospital for IV antibiotics .
At the time of statistical analysis (November 1999) ,  the median follow-up for the 104 patients included in the study was 59 months ,  61 months in the treatment arm and 55 months in the control arm .
During the follow-up period ,  disease recurrences were recorded in 28 of the 53 treated patients and in 32 of the 51 patients who did not undergo adjuvant therapy ,  20 treated patients and 28 untreated patients died .
Univariate analyses did not reveal any statistically significant difference in overall DFS and OS for any of the characteristics considered (age ,  sex ,  center of surgery ,  histology ,  grading ,  site of primary tumor ,  presentation ,  diameter ,  local treatment ,  and stratification) with the exception of adjuvant treatment (data not shown) .
The median overall DFS was 48 months among treated patients and 16 months in the control group .
Patients in the treated arm experienced a 41% reduction in the risk of disease relapse (HR ,  0.59 ,  95% CI ,  0.36 to 0.99 ,  P = .04) (Fig 2) .
The absolute improvement deriving from chemotherapy was 27% at 2 years (72% and 45% in the treatment and control arms ,  respectively ,  P = .003) ,  and 13% at 4 years (50% and 37% ,  respectively ,  P = .19) (Table 5) .
Overall ,  13 patients had a local recurrence of disease as the first relapse without simultaneous distant metastases (four patients in the treatment arm and nine patients in the control arm ,  Table 4) .
The cumulative incidence function estimates at 2 years were 0% and 10% for the treatment and the control arms ,  respectively (P = .02) ,  and at 4 years ,  they were 6% and 17% ,  respectively (P = .09) (Table 5) .
Overall ,  patients in the treatment arm had an indication of reduction in the risk of local recurrence (P = .07) .
Overall ,  the difference in distant relapses as the first event between the two arms was not significant (P = .48 ,  Fig 3) .
There were a total of 48 deaths ,  20 in the treated group and 28 in the control group ,  forty-seven deaths were disease related .
The median survival time was higher among patients who underwent adjuvant therapy (75 months) ,  compared with untreated patients (46 months) (Fig 4) .
The reduction in risk in favor of treated patients was statistically significant (HR ,  0.52 ,  95% CI ,  0.29 to 0.93 ,  P = .03) .
The regimen used in the present study represents the highest dose-intensity ever tried in an adjuvant setting for soft tissue sarcomas .
The main finding of the intention-to-treat analysis in this study is the beneficial impact of chemotherapy on the DFS (P = .04) and OS (P = .03) for patients affected by high-risk extremity soft tissue sarcomas and treated with chemotherapy .
The absolute benefit deriving from treatment was a 19% reduction in death at 4 years (P = .04) (Table 5) .
A beneficial impact of chemotherapy on DFS and OS was observed at a median follow-up time of 59 months .
However ,  a cure seems difficult to achieve in high-risk patients ,  in our study population ,  60% of the patients have relapsed and continue to die in both arms .
Nevertheless ,  a significant delay in relapse and death ,  as observed in our treatment group ,  is worthwhile and cost-effective in young patients ,  also taking into account the shortness of the treatment and the absence of toxic death .
