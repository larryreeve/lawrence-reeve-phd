The proportion of tumours graded as Dukes C was significantly lower in the radiotherapy group than in the surgery alone group (29 vs 59% , p.0.0002) and the number of involved lymph nodes was also smaller .
Tumours were significantly smaller in the radiotherapy group (Mann-Whitney , p.0.0001) .
The log-rank comparison suggests an advantage for the radiotherapy group of borderline statistical significance (p=0¡¤04) .
Figure 2 shows Kaplan-Meier curves for time free of local recurrence. 65 patients allocated surgery alone had a recurrence compared with 50 of those allocated radiotherapy .
A reduction in the risk of metastatic recurrence was found which was , rather unexpectedly , of a similar order to the reduction in local recurrence (hazard ratio 0.66 [0.46-0.95] , log-rank p=0.02) .
Consistent with the results of the individual endpoints , results for disease-free survival also suggest a benefit to the radiotherapy patients (hazard ratio 0.76 [0.58-1.0] , log-rank p=0.05) .
The hazard ratio for death from any cause is 0.79 , giving an estimated reduction in the risk of death for patints allocated radiotherapy of 21% (log-rank p=0.10) .
However , the 95% CI for this hazard ratio is wide (0.6-1.04) indicating that the data are also compatible with no advantage to radiotherapy (figure 3) .
We intended to enrol 450 patients (with the anticipation of 251 deaths) , this sample size would have provided 90% power to detect a 15% increase in the 3-year survival rate (from 35% to 50%) , which was thought plausible at the time the trial was designed .
Recruitment into the trial started in November , 1981 , and ended in November , 1989 , when 279 patients had been enrolled , 140 patients were allocated surgery alone and 139 preoperative radiotherapy (figure 1) .
Of the 279 patients , 217 died .
The extended follow-up period of the study enabled us to come close to achieving our objectives despite failure to enroll the 450 patients required for the trial design .
Failure to recruit the planned number of patients is reflected in the wide 95% CI seen for each of the main endpoints .
The effects of radiotherapy on recurrence of cancer and survival are similar to the estimates on which the trial design was based .
Of patients who received radiotherapy , 61 (45%) of 137 reported no significant morbidity 45 (33%) of all patients suffered diarrhoea and 30 (22%) had skin reactions .
The median time from randomisation to surgery was 7 days (IQR 4.12 days) for patients allocated immediate surgery and 73 days (64.84) for those allocated preoperative radiotherapy .
In 1981 , the MRC began this trial of a higher dose of preoperative radiotherapy in patients with fixed or partially fixed tumours of the rectum who were thought to be suitable for abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection .
The aim was to increase the number of patients in whom curative resection could be done , and so improve survival rates .
