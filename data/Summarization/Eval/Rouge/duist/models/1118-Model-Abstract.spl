The purpose of our study was to determine whether the chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone with respect to survival and treatment toxicity in patients with advanced carcinoma of the cervix .
From October 1990 to April 1995 ,  a total of 122 patients with advanced cervical carcinoma were included in this study and randomly assigned to either radiotherapy or concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
The patients in the concurrent group received cisplatin ,  vincristine ,  and bleomycin every 3 weeks for a total of four courses ,  in combination with radiotherapy concurrently .
Sixty patients were randomized to the concurrent chemoradiotherapy ,  and 62 were randomized to the radiotherapy alone .
A tumor response was observed in 88.3% of the patients in concurrent group and in 74.2% of the patients in radiotherapy group (P Å 0.04) .
After a median follow-up of 46.8 months ,  the overall disease-free survival and actuarial survival rate at 3 years were 51.7 and 61.7% in the concurrent group ,  and 53.2 and 64.5% in the radiotherapy group ,  respectively .
Treatment-related toxicity appears to be higher with the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone (36.7% versus 17.7% ,  P Å 0.02) .
However ,  analysis by Kaplan ­ Meier method showed that the actuarial survival was not statistically different between the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups (mean survival time: 38.1 months versus 41.5 months ,  P Å 0.27) .
In conclusion ,  this study showed that concurrent multiagent chemoradiotherapy did not prove to be a superior definitive therapy over radiotherapy alone for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
