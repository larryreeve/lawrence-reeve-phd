At present , there is no evidence to support the use of upfront CT before pelvic irradiation in stage III B cervical cancer .
The high toxicity rate of BOMP CT , in the  dose and schedule used in this study , makes this combination unacceptable for routine use .
To test this  hypothesis , we began in 1984 at the Instituto Nacional de Cancer (Rio de Janeiro , Brazil) a prospective randomized trial  comparing neoadjuvant BOMP CT followed by pelvic RT (CT + RT) versus pelvic RT alone in patients with stage IIIB carcinoma of  the cervix .
The use of upfront CT as  initial treatment before pelvic RT would be theoretically advantageous as the vascular supply to the tumor is not  compromised , allowing a higher local tissue concentration of drugs , thereby improving the effectiveness of CT .
The CR rate was 32.5% and 47% (P = .19) for the RT and CT + RT ,  respectively .
Median survivals were 25 months in the RT arm and 10.5 months in the CT + RT .
The 5-year  survival rates for the complete responders were 57% and 36% for the RT and CT + RT groups , respectively .
There was also no  difference in the incidence of distant disease between RT and CT + RT (20% v18.5%) .
Pelvic disease remains the major site of failure , with at least 50% of the patients failing within  the irradiated volume .
