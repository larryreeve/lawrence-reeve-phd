We believe there is now sufficient evidence to recommend that women with locally advanced cervical cancer confined to the pelvis receive pelvic radiation concomitantly with treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil .
In 1990 , the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) began a randomized clinical trial to compare the effects on survival of treatment with extended-field radiation and treatment with pelvic radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in patients with cervical cancer .
In our study , the benefit of para-aortic radiation may have been less than that observed in an earlier RTOG trial , because our trial required more rigorous staging of para-aortic lymph nodes and included patients with more advanced pelvic disease .
We found that the combination of pelvic radiation and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil was more effective for locally advanced cervical cancer than pelvic and para-aortic radiation alone .
A previous study reported improved survival among women with locally advanced cervical cancer who received prophylactic radiation to the para-aortic nodes .
The results of these studies are inconclusive and have been criticized because they lacked a comparison group treated with radiation alone and because the radiation therapy used may have been deficient according to current standards .
Patients who completed the pretreatment evaluation and met all eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to receive extended field radiotherapy or radiotherapy to the pelvic region with concurrent treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil .
The inclusion of chemotherapy substantially reduced both local and distant recurrences of cervical cancer , leading to higher overall and disease-free survival rates .
