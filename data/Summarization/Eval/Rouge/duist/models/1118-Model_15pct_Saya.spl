In conclusion , when comparing patients with concurrent therapy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to radiotherapy alone , our study showed that concurrent multiagent chemoradiotherapy did not prove to be a superior definitive therapy for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
The purpose of this randomized trial was to assess whether the chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone for locally advanced cervical carcinoma . We also compared the toxicity of the two compared groups after planned treatment .
The concurrent use of radiation and chemotherapy , either as a single agent or in combination , has also been demonstrated to be effective in the local control of advanced carcinoma of the cervix with acceptable toxicity as presented by several reports , and was also supported by our previous phase I and II trial .
However , most series were nonrandomized and failed to achieve an improvement in long-term survival .
Thus , we designed the randomized trial to compare the tumor response and survival rate of patients with advanced cervical carcinoma receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus patients receiving radiotherapy alone .
Our study also revealed that the patterns of recurrences were not changed by the concomitant therapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
The most likely explanation for the poor results in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group is the higher treatmentrelated toxicity , and that could limit the dose of definitive radiation employed or interrupt the planned radiotherapy .
An equally likely explanation is the negative impact of prolonged treatment time caused by toxicity-induced delays .
This study was designed as a randomized , phase III trial conducted at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan .
Tumor response definitions used were based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria .
The primary objectives were to compare the two treatment groups with respect to tumor response , failure patterns , disease-free interval , and actuarial survival .
The secondary objectives were to compare the two treatment groups with respect to treatment-related toxicities , treatment delays , and completeness .
Survival was defined as the observed length of life from protocol entry to death or until January 5 , 1997 when the data analysis was finished and patients were still alive .
Radiation effects are dependent on well-oxygenated tumor cells .
Thus , advanced carcinoma , such as those observed in our study , having a large hypoxic cell component , may be ineffective if receiving radiotherapy alone .
Therefore , the design of a more efficient treatment modality , such as the addition of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy , with the objective of increasing tumor control and long-term survival for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma , is advocated .
Patients with documented disease beyond the pelvis were excluded , as were patients with positive paraaortic lymph nodes .
Eligible patients were randomized to receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy or radiation therapy alone .
From October 1990 to April 1995 , patients with advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix were entered on the study and randomly assigned to either radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy .
Before randomization , patients were stratified by stage (stage IIb bulky versus stage IIIB) .
The local response to treatment was evaluated at 1 month after completion of therapy by physical examination and abdominopelvic computerized tomography .
All adverse effects and laboratory abnormalities for chemotherapy were graded according to the toxicity criteria of the Gynecologic Oncology Group .
A tumor response was observed in 88.4% (53/60) of the patients in concurrent group and in 74.2% (46/62) of the patient s in radiotherapy group .
