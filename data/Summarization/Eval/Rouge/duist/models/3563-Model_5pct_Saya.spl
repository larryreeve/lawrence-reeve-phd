We conclude that the single-layer continuous anastomosis requires less time to construct and has a similar risk of leakage compared with the two-layer technique .
Because of these potential advantages , we hypothesized that the single-layer technique could be introduced into our surgical teaching program with no increase in anastomotic failure and that it could be performed in less time than the two-layer technique .
It also costs less than any other method and can be safely introduced into a surgical training program with no apparent increase in complications .
The major weakness of the study is its relatively small sample size .
In today's cost-conscious environment , the use of staples for anastomoses seems irresponsible if a hand-sewn anastomosis can also be safely used in a similar time interval .
