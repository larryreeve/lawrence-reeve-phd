In the present trial , there was a significant improvement in PFS associated with CIFX , however , its impact on the patient's sense of well-being was not assessed .
The result was impressive , but the importance of bleomycin was unclear and its toxicity sometimes troublesome , so we proposed to compare cisplatin alone versus a regimen of cisplatinplus mitolactol (C + M) and a regimen of cisplatin plusifosfamide (and mesna) (CIFX) .
Treatment of cervix cancer with the combination of ifosfamide , cisplatin , and bleomycin yielded a 69% response rate (49 patients) in one series .
Although we are not aware of such complications in the present trial , the possible risk of secondary malignancies plus the failure to show an improvement in outcome for C + M would suggest a limited future for mitolactol in the treatment of cervix cancer .
Cisplatin alone has limited value in advanced cervix cancer , we are not aware of a randomized trial of cisplatin versus supportive care .
Since there was no overall survival improvement , it is unclear to what extent the improvement in PFS or in response rate actually benefitted the patients .
