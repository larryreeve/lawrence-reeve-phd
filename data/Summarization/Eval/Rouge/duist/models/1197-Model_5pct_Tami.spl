The main finding of the intention-to-treat analysis in this study is the beneficial impact of chemotherapy on the DFS (P = .04) and OS (P = .03) for patients affected by high-risk extremity soft tissue sarcomas and treated with chemotherapy .
The absolute benefit deriving from treatment was a 19% reduction in death at 4 years (P = .04) (Table 5) .
A beneficial impact of chemotherapy on DFS and OS was observed at a median follow-up time of 59 months .
However , a cure seems difficult to achieve in high-risk patients , in our study population , 60% of the patients have relapsed and continue to die in both arms .
Nevertheless , a significant delay in relapse and death , as observed in our treatment group , is worthwhile and cost-effective in young patients , also taking into account the shortness of the treatment and the absence of toxic death .
The regimen used in the present study represents the highest dose-intensity ever tried in an adjuvant setting for soft tissue sarcomas .
Inclusion criteria were as follows , age , 18 to 65 years , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2 , primary tumors subfascially localized with diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm , high-grade spindle-cell or polymorphous sarcomas (fibrosarcoma , malignant fibrous histiocytoma , polymorphous liposarcoma , leiomyosarcoma , synovial sarcoma , malignant schwannoma , angiosarcoma , and polymorphous rhabdomyosarcoma) , local relapse of any size , no previous radio/chemotherapy , adequate bone marrow (WBC count of >= 4 ,000/fiL , platelets = 120.000/mL , and hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL) , renal (creatinine <= 1.3 mg/dL) , hepatic (SGOT <= 2.5 X normal value and bilirubin <= 1.2 mg/dL) , and pulmonary functions .
Overall DFS was defined as the time between randomization and the first recurrence , and OS was defined as the time between randomization and death as a result of disease (patients dying in complete remission were considered as censored on the date of death for OS) .
Under the auspices of the Italian National Council for Research (CNR) , 104 patients , 53 in the chemotherapy and 51 in the control arm , entered the study between June , 1992 and November , 1996 .
In November , 1996 , the per protocol interim analysis of disease-free survival revealed a significant difference in favor of chemotherapy (P = .001) , therefore the accrual was stopped and the data reported .
