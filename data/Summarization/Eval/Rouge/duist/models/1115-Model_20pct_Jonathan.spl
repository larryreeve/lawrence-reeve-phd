Radical external beam plus intracavitary radiation continues to be the standard therapy for advanced cervical cancer to which all new  therapies must be compared .
Between May of 1987 and August of 1995 ,  234 patients predominantly from  two centers ,  with others participating ,  were stratified by their extent of pelvic disease and randomized to receive one of four possible  treatments .
All patients were to have tumors 5 cm or greater regardless of FIGO  stage (stages IB ,  II ,  IVA) .
Stratum 1 included those with FIGO stage IB/IIA or stage IIB with parametrial involvement limited to one or both medial parametria .
Stratum 2 included those with FIGO stage IIB disease with any lateral parametrial involvement or stage IIIB with involvement of one pelvic sidewall .
Stratum 3 included those with FIGO stage IIIB and bilateral pelvic wall involvement or stage IVA .
Patients were randomized to receive either (a) standard external beam  pelvic irradiation (EBRT) in a dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions defined at  100% versus ,  (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional intravenous 5-FU in a dose  of 1 g/m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  (c) partially hyperfractionated RT ,  5280 cGy in 33 fractions ,  2 fractions per day on  the first and last 4 days of RT ,  or (d) arm (c) with the same infusional  5-FU .
The outcomes of interest in this study were pelvic control ,  survival ,   and disease-free survival ,  as well as the serious late complication rate .
Two factors were altered in arm (d) compared to standard arm (a) ,  (1)  the addition of 5-FU ,  (2) the change in radiation fractionation scheme .
Of the 234 patients randomized ,  221 were evaluable .
With a median duration of follow-up of 59 months ,  119 of 221 patients  are alive ,  111 without evidence of disease ,  and 8 with disease present .
There is no significant difference in the overall 5-year disease-free survival between the treatment arms .
Thereis a trend in favor of standard radiation and 5-FU .
Whereas there was once again a trend in favor of concurrent 5-FU ,  particularly in combination with standard radiation ,  the difference was  not statistically significant .
There was a significant improvement in 5-year survival and disease-free survival for those treated with standard radiation and 5-FU compared to  the other treatments (log rank test P 5 0.05) .
The actuarial 5-year disease-free survival was 76% compared to 65% for hyperfractionated irradiation plus 5-FU ,  58% for hyperfractionated irradiation alone ,  and 39% for standard radiation .
Similar differences were observed in pelvic control ,  but the addition  of 5-FU to standard radiation resulted in a greater improvement in  disease-free survival than in pelvic control .
In examining the effect of the addition of 5-FU on disease-free  survival in stratum 1 ,  there is a highly significant difference in favor of the use  of 5-FU regardless of the radiation employed .
However ,  in evaluating the importance of the contribution of the change  in fractionation to the differences observed ,  there was no significant difference in the 5-year survival of those treated on standard  radiation versus those treated with hyperfractionated irradiation whether or not  5-FU was used .
The observed differences in pelvic control and survival in favor of the standard radiation and concurrent 5-FU associated with the addition of  5-FU rather than the change in radiation schedule .
Stratum 2 was examined for differences in pelvic control and survival between the treatment arms and no significant differences were  observed .
Since significant differences in pelvic control and survival were  observed in stratum 1 which contained only 99 patients ,  it is important to  examine whether there was an uneven distribution of other possible patient or tumor-related prognostic factors across the treatment arms to account  for the differences observed .
Patients were stratified into three groups in this study because pelvic control and survival outcomes are strongly influenced by the bulk of  pelvic disease ,  declining with increasing bulk .
The original design for this study required 292 patients with adequate  power to detect a 15% difference in pelvic control and survival .
There were too few patients (17) in stratum 3 to justify further  analysis .
Within stratum 2 there was an improvement in pelvic control with the  use of 5-FU but the difference was not statistically significant .
However ,  in stratum 1 constituted of patients with stage IB/IIA and  those IIB tumors with medial parametrial involvement ,  a significant  improvement in both pelvic control and disease-free survival in favor of standard  radiation with concurrent 5-FU was observed (Figs . 5 and 6) .
The disease-free survival with standard radiation alone ,  however ,  was surprisingly low at 39% .
The direction of benefit in favor of 5-FU with standard radiation  compared to the other treatments was the same in strata 1 and 2. Because of the small numbers in each treatment arm it was surprising to observe a significant difference .
With so few randomized the possibility exists that an imbalance in prognostic factors exists between the treatment arms might account for  the observed outcome differences .
The tumor- and patient-related factors examined were FIGO stage (IB  versus IIA versus IIB) ,  size of tumor (greater or less than 6 cm and greater  or less than 7 cm) ,  grade of tumor the presence or absence of  capillary-like space involvement ,  nodal involvement ,  and patient age as a continuous variable .
The only significant factor predicting for disease-free survival was  the use of 5-FU .
The risk ratio for recurrence and death from disease was reduced to  0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 0.97) .
Thus ,  there is no obvious explanation for the differences observed  other than a treatment effect from the 5-FU .
With so few patients ,  however ,  there may still be a maldistribution of  some unrecognized tumor or patient-related prognostic factor which could be responsible for the differences observed .
The overall incidence of serious complications was too low to detect differences between the treatment arms .
Hyperfractionated radiation and 5-FU should theoretically have offered  a benefit over that of standard radiation and 5-FU if increased tumor  cell kill results from any interaction between the modalities .
Such a benefit was not observed in this study .
From the subset analysis of this trial we have generated the hypothesis  that there may be a beneficial effect of adding concurrent infusional 5-FU  to standard in patients with the disease characteristics of stratum 1. Since the data are not conclusive because of limited numbers ,   confirmation of the beneficial effects observed in this study is necessary .
The number of patients is too few to recommend that concurrent  infusional 5-FU with pelvic irradiation should become the standard therapy for  these patients .
