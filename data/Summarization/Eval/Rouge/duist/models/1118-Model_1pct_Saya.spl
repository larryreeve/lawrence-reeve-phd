In conclusion , when comparing patients with concurrent therapy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to radiotherapy alone , our study showed that concurrent multiagent chemoradiotherapy did not prove to be a superior definitive therapy for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
The purpose of this randomized trial was to assess whether the chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone for locally advanced cervical carcinoma . We also compared the toxicity of the two compared groups after planned treatment .
