The trial we report was started in 1995 to compare irinotecan with supportive care alone for survival , quality  of life , and other clinical variables .
The participants were  patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in whom fluorouracil chemotherapy had failed .
This study showed that treatment with irinotecan and supportive care alone , compared with supportive care , prolonged the life of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer .
This benefit was clinically meaningful because  the probability of surviving 1 year was 2.6 times greater in patients given irinotecan compared with that of patients given supportive care alone .
Other efficacy endpoints , such as survival without weight loss , survival  without performance status deterioration , pain-free survival , and quality-of-life , were all significantly in  favour of irinotecan .
The survival advantage for the irinotecan group remained highly significant after adjustment of performance status , a well-recognised prognostic  factor .
Furthermore , irinotecan improved the symptoms of patients and delayed the onset of  tumour-related symptoms such as performance-status deterioration , weight loss , and pain .
Irinotecan can therefore be recommended as the standard second-line therapy in colorectal cancer and as a new reference for forthcoming clinical trials .
189 patients were randomly allocated irinotecan and supportive care and 90 patients were allocated  supportive care alone (figure 1) .
Patients in the irinotecan group lived significantly longer than those in the supportive-care  group (p=0.0001) .
This benefit appeared after 2 months and became more apparent throughout the study period.  1-year survival was 36.2% and 13.8% in the irinotecan and supportive-care groups , respectively .
Median  survival was 9.2 and 6.5 months , respectively .
Pain-free survival in patients without pain at baseline (figure 4) was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the supportive-care group (p=0.003) , despite a higher proportion of patients on opioids in the supportive-care group .
Survival without weight loss of more than 5% (p=0.018) and survival without performance-status deterioration (p=0.0001) were significantly longer in the irinotecan group .
