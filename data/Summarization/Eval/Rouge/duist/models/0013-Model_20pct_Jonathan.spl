A phase II study of the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) demonstrated activity formitolactol as a single agent in cervical cancer using 180mg/m/d for 10 days by mouth in repeated 4-week cycles .
There were 55 assessable patients , with one CR and 15 partial responses (PRs) (29% response rate) .
Ifosfamide is a new agent closely related to cyclophosphamide , but with less marrow toxicity and more bladder toxicity that requires concomitant use of the uroprotectormesna .
Eligible patients included women with histologically confirmed advanced (stage IVB) , recurrent , or persistent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix not suitable for curative treatment with surgery and/or radiotherapy .
Patients were prospectively stratified according to whether they had received prior radiation-sensitizer treatment (hydroxyurea , cisplatin , or fluorouracil) and by PS , and were then centrally randomized with equal probability to receive (1) cisplatin 50 mg/m with appropriate hydration every 3 weeks for a maximum of six courses , or (2) cisplatin 50 mg/m on day 1 plus mitolactol (180 mg/m orally for 5 days) on days 2 through 6 every 3 weeks , or (3) cisplatin 50mg/m plus ifosfamide 5.0 g/m over 24 hours plus mesna 6 g/m given concurrently with ifosfamide and for 12 hours after , every 3 weeks , again for a maximum of six courses .
CR was defined as the disappearance of all gross evidence of disease for at least 4 weeks .
The design for this study was based on the assumption that a 15% increase in the response rate due to the addition of either mitolactolor ifosfamide to cisplatin would be regarded as clinically meaningful .
Thus , there were 140 eligible patients on the cisplatin arm , 147 on the C + M arm , and 151 onthe CIFX arm .
There was more granulocytopenia , thrombocytopenia ,and leukocytopenia associated with C + M compared with cisplatin alone (P < .025) .
Also , more granulocytopenia , thrombocytopenia , and nausea and vomiting were associated with CIFX versus cisplatin alone (P < .025)(Table 2) .
Peripheral (P = .013) and central neurotoxicity (P = .001) were both significantly more frequent and severe with CIFX compared with cisplatin alone (Table 3) , but not so for C + M .
There was a significantly greater frequency of response (31.1%) among patients treated with CIFX compared with cisplatin alone (17.8% , P = .004 , Table 4) .
The frequency of response among those treated with C + M (21.1%) was only slightly greater than cisplatin and not statistically significant .
The median durations of response among those who did respond were 5.5 , 7.7 , and 10 months , respectively , for cisplatin alone , C + M , and CIFX .
There was no significant difference in survival between cisplatin and either of the combination regimens (median[months] , cisplatin , 8.0 , C + M , 7.3 , CIFX , 8.3 , P =.835) (Fig 2) .
Age was associated with survival (P =.025) , with younger age being unfavorable (Fig 3) , this , in turn , was correlated with a shorter time from diagnosis to study entry .
The results of this trial in cervix cancer reflect a common set of findings in combination chemotherapy of advanced solid tumors , namely , a higher response rate (but not a high CR rate) with a combination compared with single-agent therapy at the cost of more toxicity and no survival benefit .
In the present trial , there was a significant improvement in PFS associated with CIFX , however , its impact on the patient's sense of well-being was not assessed .
Since there was no overall survival improvement , it is unclear to what extent the improvement in PFS or in response rate actually benefitted the patients .
The C + M regimen was well tolerated , but disappointing .
Perhaps that dose of mitolactol is too low to provide an additional effect with cisplatin .
In contrast , the present trial , which used cisplatin 50 mg/m2 plus ifosfamide , has shown an impact on PFS .
