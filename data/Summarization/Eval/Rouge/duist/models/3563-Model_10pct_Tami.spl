The present study demonstrates that a single-layer continuous anastomosis is similar in terms of safety to the two-layer technique , but that it  can be constructed in a significantly shorter time and at a lower cost .
With the single-layer method , less circumferential clearing is required , and in many instances no clearance is necessary .
The mean time saved by creating the single-layer anastomosis , 10 minutes ,may seem relatively insignificant .
However , our study design did not include the time required to prepare the bowel for anastomosis , which is considerably less for the one-layer technique .
In contrast , it is difficult for an experienced surgeon to create a two-layer anastomosis in less than 20 to 25 minutes .
It was surprising to see the considerable difference in cost of materials for the anastomoses .
The major weakness of the study is its relatively small sample size .
It is therefore difficult to make definitive statements regarding the relative risk of uncommon outcomes , such as anastomotic leakage .
To detect a significant difference in leakage rates based on our data , a power analysis indicated that 1 ,500 patients would be required .
However , our results and those in the literature are consistent and reassuring .
