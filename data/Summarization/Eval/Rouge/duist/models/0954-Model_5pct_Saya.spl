This study of premenopausal women with breast cancer demonstrates that locoregional radiotherapy reduces the rates of locoregional and systemic relapses and the chance of dying from breast cancer .
To test the hypothesis that adding radiation to adjuvant systemic therapy improves the outcome in patients with breast cancer , we designed a randomized trial in 1978 in British Columbia .
These data based on a 15-year follow-up indicate that radiation can offer substantial protection from systemic relapse to node-positive patients .
In node-positive patients , adding locoregional radiotherapy may be essential to prevent secondary dissemination from the residual locoregional metastatic disease , and it could increase the potential for cure .
TRIALS of postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer conducted during the 1960s and 1970s showed significant reductions in rates of locoregional recurrence but no improvement in overall survival .
