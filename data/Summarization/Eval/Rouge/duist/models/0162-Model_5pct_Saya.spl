In conclusion , the 5-yr results of our randomized study confirm that CMF , particularly when delivered at nearly full doses , can indeed alter the postoperative course of breast cancer with positive axillary nodes .
All our progress reports have consistently demonstrated that there was a significant difference in the relapse-free survival (RFS) favoring patients who received adjuvant CMF .
These results , as well as those reported in similar studies , suggest that the multimodality approach with cyclical combination chemotherapy is indeed an important advance in the strategy of primary management of resectable breast cancer , and therefore it is worthy of more widespread consideration .
Among the numerous questions to be answered by current adjuvant studies is the optimal duration of treatment .
For this reason , in September 1975 , we started a new prospective study with the intent to evaluate the possibility of reducing the duration of adjuvant CMF without compromising the therapeutic effect of combined treatment .
SINCE JUNE 1973, the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of CMF (cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , and fluorouracil) chemotherapy were evaluated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes .
The aim of the first program was to evaluate whether CMF given after radical surgery was able to alter the course of the disease .
After radical mastectomy , eligible patients were prospectively randomized to receive either no further treatment or 12 monthly cycles of adjuvant CMF .
The 5-yr results of the present study are now sufficiently mature to indicate with confidence that 6 cycles of CMF are equivalent to 12 cycles in terms of RFS and total survival .
