Vogl et al and Alberts et al using a combination of bleomycin ,   vincristine ,  mitomycin ,  and cisplatin (BOMP) in patients with metastatic and/or  recurrent disease reported high response rates (> 20% of  the patients with a  complete response [CR]) with acceptable toxicity .
To test this  hypothesis ,  we began in 1984 at the Instituto Nacional de Cancer (Rio de Janeiro ,  Brazil) a prospective randomized trial   comparing neoadjuvant BOMP CT followed by pelvic RT (CT + RT) versus pelvic RT  alone in patients with stage IIIB carcinoma of  the cervix .
Between April 1984 and August 1986 ,  107 previously untreated patients  with stage III B carcinoma of the cervix were entered  on the study .
Eligibility criteria consisted of a histopathologic diagnosis of  squamous cell carcinoma ,  age younger than 70  years with no past history of malignancy ,  the lower third of the vagina free of disease ,  and a  performance status greater  than 50% in the Karnofsky scale .
Thus ,  there were 39 assessable patients in the CT + RT  arm and 52 in  the RT arm .
A tumor dose of 50 Gy ,  in 2 Gy daily fractions ,  5 days per week ,   was prescribed at midplane .
Chemotherapy consisted of bleomycin 15 U intramuscularly (IM) every 12  hours from days 1 to 4 (total dose ,  120 U) ,   vincristine 1 mg/m2 IV on day 1 ,  mitomycin 10 mg/im 2 IV on day 1 ,  and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1 ,   given on an outpatient  basis every 3 weeks for three cycles .
A CR was defined as the complete resolution of all  measurable disease  and symptoms ,  a partial response (PR) was defined as a 50% or more decrease  in the sum of the products of  perpendicular diameters of measurable  disease ,  and stable disease (SD) was defined as less than a 50% decrease in the  sum of  the products of perpendicular diameters of the measurable lesions .
All patients were observed to determine the efficiency of the combined therapy by comparing overall survival ,  rate of local  control ,   incidence of distant metastases ,  and toxicity between treatment regimens .
The median follow-up time for the RT arm is 51 months (range ,  34 to 67)  and is 44 months  (range ,  35 to 65) for the CT + RT .
The CR rate was 32.5% and 47% (P = .19) for the RT and CT + RT ,  respectively .
The CR  rate after three cycles of BOMP CT was 25.5% .
For the partial responders ,  57% in the RT arm and 37.5% in the CT + RT  are alive with no evidence of  disease progression at a minimum follow-up  time of 3 years .
Median survivals were 25 months in the RT arm and 10.5 months in the CT  + RT .
The 5-year  survival rates for the complete responders were 57% and 36%  for the RT and CT + RT groups ,  respectively .
Pelvic disease remains the major site of failure ,  with at least 50% of  the patients failing within  the irradiated volume .
There was also no  difference in the incidence of distant disease  between RT and CT + RT (20% v18.5%) .
Of greater concern was the bleomycin-related pulmonary toxicity .
Five patients (13%) developed such a  complication ,  and four died as a direct result .
After two bleomycin-related lung deaths (two of nine treated patients) ,   the bleomycin dose was reduced from 30 U daily for 4 days to 30 U daily for  3 days .
In spite of this ,  two further patients  experienced a similar  complication (two of 18 treated patients) .
The rationale for the use of neoadjuvant CT23 is that (1) the blood  supply to the tumor is not compromised by previous  radiotherapy or surgery allowing for better drug distribution into the tumor ,  (2) patients' tolerance to CT may be enhanced  as performance status and marrow  reserve are unaltered by previous treatment ,  (3) decreasing the bulkiness of  the primary  disease would improve the effectiveness of the local RT ,  (4)  there is the possibility of eradication of subclinical  metastases ,  and (5) theoretically a tumor may be more chemosensitive before surgery or RT .
These reasons together with the  initial promising results with BOMP prompted us to start our randomized study .
Although 25.5% of the patients achieved a CR following three cycles of  BOMP and 47% of the CT + RT group obtained a CR at the  end of RT ,  the  5-year overall survival was significantly inferior in the CT + RT group than  in the control arm (39% v 21% ,  P  = .02) .
Furthermore ,  even if we exclude the patients who experienced treatment-related death ,  the survival in the BOMP group remains significantly inferior (39% v 25%) .
The most likely explanation for the poorer results in these neoadjuvant trials is the enhancement of accelerated tumor cell proliferation  during treatment .
Another possible explanatory mechanism for our poorer results with the combined treatment modality may be the development of  cross resistance between radiation and certain antineoplastic agents .
It is now clear that response rate is  a poor end point .
The lung toxicity experienced by patients in the CT + RT group is unacceptable .
In this study ,  the incidence of pulmonary  toxicity was 13% (five of  39) ,  with four patients dying from this complication .
The high toxicity rate of BOMP CT ,  in the  dose and schedule used in  this study ,  makes this combination unacceptable for routine use .
Theuse of concomitant CT (usually  fluorouracil and/or cisplatin) and  RT has shown promising therapeutic results in a variety of tumors43-45 and may prove  useful in circumventing the problem of accelerated regrowth of surviving clonogens .
The role of concurrent radiosensitizing  CT has yet to be established  in advanced carcinoma of the cervix ,  but this approach deserves further exploitation .
