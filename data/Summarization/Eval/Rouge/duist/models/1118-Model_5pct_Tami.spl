In conclusion , when comparing patients with concurrent therapy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to radiotherapy alone , our study showed that concurrent multiagent chemoradiotherapy did not prove to be a superior definitive therapy for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
Our results demonstrated that multiagent chemoradiotherapy , concurrently administrated with radiation to improve tumor response , can also produce serious acute and late toxicities , and life-threatening complications .
Our results indicated that , despite the excellent early tumor response seen during treatment , the benefit of concurrent chemoradiation in terms of reduced mortality and increased pelvic control rates may not be as great as that suggested by other reports .
Our study also revealed that the patterns of recurrences were not changed by the concomitant therapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
Thus  , we designed the randomized trial to compare the tumor response and survival rate of patients with advanced cervical carcinoma receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus patients receiving radiotherapy alone .
The purpose of this randomized trial was to assess whether the chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone for locally advanced cervical carcinoma .
We also compared the toxicity of the two compared groups after planned treatment .
After a median follow-up of 46.8 months , the disease-free survival and actuarial survival rates at 3 years for patients in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group were not statistically different compared with patients in the radiotherapy group (51.7% versus 53.2% , P Å 0.92 , and 61.7% versus 64.5% , P Å 0.88 , respectively) .
