The proportion of tumours graded as Dukes C was significantly lower in the radiotherapy group than in the surgery alone group (29 vs 59% , p.0.0002) and the number of involved lymph nodes was also smaller .
Tumours were significantly smaller in the radiotherapy group (Mann-Whitney , p.0.0001) .
The log-rank comparison suggests an advantage for the radiotherapy group of borderline statistical significance (p=0¡¤04) .
Figure 2 shows Kaplan-Meier curves for time free of local recurrence. 65 patients allocated surgery alone had a recurrence compared with 50 of those allocated radiotherapy .
A reduction in the risk of metastatic recurrence was found which was , rather unexpectedly , of a similar order to the reduction in local recurrence (hazard ratio 0.66 [0.46-0.95] , log-rank p=0.02) .
Consistent with the results of the individual endpoints , results for disease-free survival also suggest a benefit to the radiotherapy patients (hazard ratio 0.76 [0.58-1.0] , log-rank p=0.05) .
