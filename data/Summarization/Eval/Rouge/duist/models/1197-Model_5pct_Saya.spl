The main finding of the intention-to-treat analysis in this study is the beneficial impact of chemotherapy on the DFS (P = .04) and OS (P = .03) for patients affected by high-risk extremity soft tissue sarcomas and treated with chemotherapy .
However , a cure seems difficult to achieve in high-risk patients , in our study population , 60% of the patients have relapsed and continue to die in both arms .
Nevertheless , a significant delay in relapse and death , as observed in our treatment group , is worthwhile and cost-effective in young patients , also taking into account the shortness of the treatment and the absence of toxic death .
Nevertheless , a great proportion of high-risk soft tissue sarcoma patients develop distant metastases during theirI lives .
In the early 1960s , this clinical behaviour prompted the introduction of adjuvant chemotherapy trials with the aim of increasing DFS and possibly overall survival (OS) .
Toxicities were graded according to World Health Organization criteria .
Overall DFS was defined as the time between randomization and the first recurrence , and OS was defined as the time between randomization and death as a result of disease (patients dying in complete remission were considered as censored on the date of death for OS) .
The intention-to-treat analyses for overall DFS and OS were based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival function .
The absolute improvement deriving from chemotherapy was 27% at 2 years (72% and 45% in the treatment and control arms , respectively , P = .003) , and 13% at 4 years (50% and 37% , respectively , P = .19) (Table 5) .
Overall , patients in the treatment arm had an indication of reduction in the risk of local recurrence (P = .07) .
