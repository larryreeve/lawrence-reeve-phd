The results of this trial in cervix cancer reflect a common set of  findingsin combination chemotherapy of advanced solid tumors ,  namely , a higher response rate (but not a high CR rate) with a combination compared  with single-agent therapy at the cost of more toxicity and no  survival benefit .
There was no significant difference in survival between cisplatin  and either of the combination regimens (median[months] , cisplatin , 8.0 , C +  M , 7.3 , CIFX , 8.3 , P =.835) (Fig 2) .
There was a significantly greater frequency of response(31.1%) among patients treated with CIFX compared with cisplatin alone (17.8% , P  = .004 , Table 4) .
The frequency of response among those treated with C + M (21.1%)  was only slightly greater than cisplatin and not statistically significant .
PFS (Fig 1) adjusted for age , PS , and prior cisplatinas a  radiosensitizerwas statistically significantly longer for CIFX  (median , 4.6 v 3.2 months) compared with cisplatin alone (P = .003) , however , there was no  difference between C + M and cisplatin alone .
Age was associated with survival (P =.025) , with younger age being unfavorable (Fig 3) , this , in turn , was correlated with a shorter  time from diagnosis to study entry .
Peripheral (P = .013) and central neurotoxicity (P = .001) were both significantly more frequent and severe with CIFX compared with  cisplatinalone (Table 3) , but not so for C + M .
There was more granulocytopenia , thrombocytopenia ,and leukocytopenia associated with C + M compared with cisplatin alone (P < .025) .
Also , more granulocytopenia , thrombocytopenia , and nausea and  vomiting were associated with CIFX versus cisplatin alone (P < .025) (Table 2) .
Between June 1990 and January 1994 , 454 women entered the study of  whom 16 were ineligible (wrong stage , n = 2 , wrong cell type , n = 9 , wrong  primarytumor , n = 2 , prior chemotherapy , n = 2 , second primary  tumor , n = 1) , which left 438 eligible patients (including 10 who received no drug , all  wereincluded in the intent to-treat analysis) .
Thus , there were 140 eligible patients on the cisplatin arm , 147  on the C + M arm , and 151 onthe CIFX arm .
Eligible patients included women with histologically confirmed  advanced(stage IVB) , recurrent , or persistent squamous cell  carcinoma of the cervix not suitable for curative treatment with surgery and/or  radiotherapy .
Patients were prospectively stratified according to whether they had received prior radiation-sensitizer treatment (hydroxyurea ,  cisplatin ,orfluorouracil) and by PS , and were then centrally  randomized with equal probability to receive (1) cisplatin 50 mg/m with appropriate  hydrationevery 3 weeks for a maximum of six courses , or (2)  cisplatin 50 mg/m on day 1 plus mitolactol (180 mg/m orally for 5 days) on days 2 through 6  every 3 weeks , or (3) cisplatin 50mg/m plus ifosfamide 5.0 g/m over 24  hours plus mesna 6 g/m given concurrently with ifosfamide and for 12 hours  after , every 3 weeks , again for a maximum of six courses .
CR was defined as the disappearance of all gross evidence of  disease for at least 4 weeks .
PR was a >= 50% reduction in theproduct obtained from the  measurement of each lesion for at least 4 weeks .
The design for this study was based on the assumption that a 15%  increase in the response rate due to the addition of either mitolactolor  ifosfamide to cisplatin would be regarded as clinically meaningful .
Therefore , the primary objective of this study was to compare the  proportionof patients who responded to the cisplatin-only regimen  versus each of the combination regimens .
