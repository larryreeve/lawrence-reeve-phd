Therefore , we conclude that MeCCNU is not an essential component of effective postoperative combined modality treatment of adjuvant rectal cancer and should not be included in future treatment regimens .
Although the superiority of combination radiotherapy and chemotherapy with fluorouracil(5-FU) and semustine (MeCCNU) was clearly shown in terms of both disease-free survival and , subsequently , overall survival , the clinical impact of such treatment was tempered by the inclusion of MeCCNU in an adjuvant setting .
The leukemogenic effect of MeCCNU was established subsequent to the initiation of GI 7175 , indeed , one patient who participated in GI 7175 developed acute myeloid leukemia after MeCCNU therapy .
Consequently , the GITSG sought to assess the contribution of MeCCNU to the combined modality regimen in study GI 7180 .
In 1985 , the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG , study GI 7175) reported that postoperative radiation and chemotherapy reduced the tumor recurrence rate for patients who had undergone a curative resection for rectal adenocarcinoma .
A two-arm study was designed using the initial radiation/chemotherapy program of the previous study (GI 7175) for both arms of the new study (GI7180) but to offering MeCCNU to only half the patients during the postradiation period .
The same postradiation regimen of 5-FU and MeCCNU as that used in GI 7175 was chosen for one arm , with the exception that the duration of treatment with postradiation 5-FU and MeCCNU was reduced from 18 months to 12 months in an attempt to reduce the leukemogenic potential of the MeCCNU .
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an adjuvant treatment with radiation therapy and escalating 5-FU and to compare it with a combination of 5-FU and MeCCNU .
A major goal was to assess the contribution of MeCCNU to adjuvant benefit .
The clinical characteristics were well balanced between the treatment arms , with a slightly higher percentage of patients having disease extension into perirectal fat randomized to receive 5-FU and MeCCNU (61%) compared with escalating 5-FU (56%) , and a higher percentage of males randomized to escalating 5-FU compared with 5-FU and MeCCNU (63% v 56% , respectively) .
