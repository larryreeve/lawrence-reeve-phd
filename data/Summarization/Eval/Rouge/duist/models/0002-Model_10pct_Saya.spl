Our results demonstrate the superiority of radiotherapy and chemotherapy either with cisplatin alone or with cisplatin , fluorouracil , and hydroxyurea in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (stage IIB , III , or IVA without metastasis to the para-aortic lymph nodes) .
We recommend cisplatin as the standard drug for radiotherapy and chemotherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer .
The ability of radiotherapy to cure locally advanced cervical cancer is limited by the size of the tumor , because the doses required to treat large tumors exceed the limit of toxicity in normal tissue .
Survival rates were also significantly better in these two groups (P=0.004 and P=0.002 , respectively) than in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy (Fig. 2) .
In our study , the duration of radiotherapy and the dose of radiation were similar among the three regimens , implying that the differences in progression-free survival and survival were related to the chemotherapy .
Patients who received the platinum-based regimens had significantly longer progression-free survival than those who received hydroxyurea (P<0.001 for both comparisons) (Fig. 1) .
Thus , a total of 526 patients were included in the analysis , 176 in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy , 173 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin , fluorouracil , and hydroxyurea , and 177 in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
There were no significant differences in the clinical characteristics among the three treatment groups (Table 2) .
In our study , to improve the efficacy of the cisplatin and fluorouracil combination , we added hydroxyurea to the regimen , because of evidence that this drug inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and depletes tumor cells of deoxyuridine monophosphate .
Therefore , we undertook a randomized study in which all women with locally advanced cervical cancer received local radiation as well as weekly concomitant treatment with cisplatin alone , the combination of cisplatin , fluorouracil , and hydroxyurea , or hydroxyurea alone .
