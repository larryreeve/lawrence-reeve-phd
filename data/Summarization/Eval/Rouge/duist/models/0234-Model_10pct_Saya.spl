Our results show that EPI has therapeutic activity that is similar to that of DOX in patients with advanced breast cancer , and that EPI is a less cardiotoxic drug than DOX , even accounting for the difference in myelosuppressive potency .
In this study , EPI had therapeutic activity in breast cancer similar to DOX , but produced less cardiotoxicity than the parent compound .
DOXORUBICIN (DOX) , or Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories , Columbus , Ohio) , is one of the most useful antineoplastic agents available .
Its use , however , is limited by cumulative , dose-dependent , chronic cardiotoxicity .
Epirubicin is a new anthracycline with reduced cardiac toxicity , but preserved efficacy in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer .
More recently , however , subclinical cardiac injury has been documented at considerably lower doses .
Discontinuation of therapy in these patients may prevent cardiac failure , but also results in curtailment of the antineoplastic effect of DOX .
One approach to solving this problem is the development of DOX analogues that retain antineoplastic activity but possess reduced potential for cardiac damage .
The antitumor activity of EPI in animal models is similar to that of DOX , but EPI is a less toxic compound with regard to both cytotoxicity and cardiac injury .
Fifty-four patients with advanced breast cancer who had failed prior nonanthracycline combination chemotherapy were randomized to treatment with either epirubicin 85 mg/m2 or doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 intravenously every three weeks .
Cardiotoxicity was monitored by serial multigated radionuclide cineangiocardiography performed at rest and after exercise .
The median duration of response to epirubicin was 11.9 months compared to 7.1 months with doxorubicin .
Using methods of survival analysis , the median doses to the development of laboratory cardiotoxicity were estimated to be 935 mg/m2 of epirubicin and 468 mg/m2 of doxorubicin .
Epirubicin (4'-epi-doxorubicin , EPI) is one such compound .
Patients were stratified for performance status (Karnofsky scale < 70% v > 80%) and for estrogen receptor status of the primary or a metastatic lesion (positive or unknown v negative) .
All patients were then randomly assigned to receive either EPI or DOX .
The dose of EPI was 85 mg/m2 , and the dose of DOX was 60 mg/m2 .
Neither patients nor physicians were blinded with respect to treatment .
The criteria for evaluation of therapeutic response were based on the recommendations of the Breast Cancer Task Force of the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda , Md) .
The median duration of PR for patients responding to EPI was 11.9 months , whereas median duration of PR on the DOX arm was 7.1 months .
toxicity alone did not limit the administration of EPI , but DOX was discontinued in three patients with ongoing PRs because of cardiac toxicity .
