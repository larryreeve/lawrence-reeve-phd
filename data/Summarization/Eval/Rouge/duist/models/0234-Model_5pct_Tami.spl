In this study , EPI had therapeutic activity in breast cancer similar to DOX , but produced less cardiotoxicity than the parent compound .
In the present trial , EPI was compared with its parent compound in terms of both toxicity and antitumor efficacy .
The observed major therapeutic response rate to EPI (25%) was identical to that observed with DOX (25%) .
In the present study , each drug was given every three weeks in doses that produced equivalent degrees of myelosuppression , a preplanned limitation on the total cumulative dose of EPI was not used .
In the present study , EPI was found to be significantly less cardiotoxic than DOX , even when the dose is normalized to full myelosuppressive equivalence .
In contrast , the present study predicts an incidence of laboratory cardiotoxicity in excess of 70% for those patients who receive more than 600 mg/m2 of DOX .
Our results show that EPI has therapeutic activity that is similar to that of DOX in patients with advanced breast cancer , and that EPI is a less cardiotoxic drug than DOX , even accounting for the difference in myelosuppressive potency .
A combination of RNCA and endomyocardial biopsy is recommended for the individual patient at high risk for whom a therapeutic decision must be made .
Thus , while assessment of LVEF by RNCA was useful in quantitating changes in cardiacfunction for the purposes of this study , it cannot be recommended for routine monitoring of individual patients as a predictor of impending cardiac failure .
These findings , which are supported by the independent work of several other investigators , provide encouragement for further clinical trials with EPI .
