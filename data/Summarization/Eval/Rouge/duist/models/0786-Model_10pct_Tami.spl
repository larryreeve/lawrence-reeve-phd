The results of this study indicate that treatment after surgical resection of Dukes B2 and C rectal cancer with escalating 5-FU postradiation therapy provides similar survival and recurrence outcomes as a postradiation chemotherapeutic regimen including the leukemogen MeCCNU .
Both survival and disease-free survival results favor the escalating 5-FU arm , although these differences did not reach statistical significance .
Fewer recurrences involving distant sites occurred on the escalating 5-FU arm compared with the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm , further suggesting that MeCCNU is not an essential component of the postradiation chemotherapy treatment .
Although similar rates of local recurrence were experienced on the two study arms , the similarity in outcome is not surprising as both arms used identical postsurgery radiation therapy regimens including 5-FU .
The results of this study show that comparable results can be achieved using a combination regimen that does not include MeCCNU , this conclusion is also supported by preliminary data reported by the NCCTG .
The increased leukemicpotential of MeCCNU makes the drug additionally undesirable to include in the adjuvant setting .
Therefore , we conclude that MeCCNU is not an essential component of effective postoperative combined modality treatment of adjuvant rectal cancer and should not be included in future treatment regimens .
Of the 199 patients who comprised the cohort for primary analysis , 95 were randomized to receive postradiation 5-FU and MeCCNU , and 104 were randomized to receive postradiation escalating 5-FU .
A total of 91 deaths have been reported , 46% (44 of 95) on 5-FU and MeCCNU and 45% (47 of 104) on 5-FU .
Kaplan-Meier estimates of 3-year survival probabilities for patients assigned to 5-FU and MeCCNU and escalating 5-FU are 66% and 75% , respectively (Fig 2) .
Disease recurrence has been documented in 48% of eligible patients including 54% (51 of 95) of patient srandomized to receive 5-FU and MeCCNU and 43% (45 of 104) of patients randomized to receive escalating 5-FU (Table 3) .
Recurrences involving local sites occurred in 17% of 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 16% of escalating 5-FU patients .
Significantly (P = .05) more recurrences involving distant sites have been documented on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm (40%) compared with the escalating 5-FU arm (26%) .
The probability of 3-year disease-free survival on the two arms is 54% and 68% for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and the escalating 5-FU arm , respectively , median time to recurrenceis estimated to be 4 years and greater than 4 years , respectively (Fig 1) .
The difference in disease-free survival favors the escalating 5-FU arm , but this difference is not statistically significant (P = .20 , two-tailed) .
Toxicities experienced by patients on the two arms are comparable , 53% of patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNUarm (52 of 99) and 50% of those assigned to the escalating 5-FU arm (54 of 107) experienced at least one episode of severe or worse toxicity as defined by the GITSG toxicity scale .
Life-threatening toxicities were reported in six (6%) 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 11 (10%) escalating 5-FU patients .
Leukocyte depression below 1 ,000/UL accounted for a majority of these episodes (eight patients on the escalating 5-FU arm and three on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm) .
