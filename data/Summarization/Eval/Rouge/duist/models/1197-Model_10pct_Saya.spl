The main finding of the intention-to-treat analysis in this study is the beneficial impact of chemotherapy on the DFS (P = .04) and OS (P = .03) for patients affected by high-risk extremity soft tissue sarcomas and treated with chemotherapy .
However , a cure seems difficult to achieve in high-risk patients , in our study population , 60% of the patients have relapsed and continue to die in both arms .
Nevertheless , a significant delay in relapse and death , as observed in our treatment group , is worthwhile and cost-effective in young patients , also taking into account the shortness of the treatment and the absence of toxic death .
Nevertheless , a great proportion of high-risk soft tissue sarcoma patients develop distant metastases during theirI lives .
In the early 1960s , this clinical behaviour prompted the introduction of adjuvant chemotherapy trials with the aim of increasing DFS and possibly overall survival (OS) .
Toxicities were graded according to World Health Organization criteria .
Overall DFS was defined as the time between randomization and the first recurrence , and OS was defined as the time between randomization and death as a result of disease (patients dying in complete remission were considered as censored on the date of death for OS) .
The intention-to-treat analyses for overall DFS and OS were based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survival function .
The absolute improvement deriving from chemotherapy was 27% at 2 years (72% and 45% in the treatment and control arms , respectively , P = .003) , and 13% at 4 years (50% and 37% , respectively , P = .19) (Table 5) .
Overall , patients in the treatment arm had an indication of reduction in the risk of local recurrence (P = .07) .
Although these first-generation trials are no longer the gold standards , the meta-analysis did reveal a number of elements that suggested a positive role of adjuvant chemotherapy .
The treatment of limb sarcomas mainly relies on a combined-modality approach , after the demonstration that pre-or postoperative radiation and conservative surgery led to local control in a high proportion of patients .
In fact , limb-sparing procedures allow an 85% to 90% local dis-ease-free survival (DFS) rate and demolitive surgery now represents only 5% to 10% of the operations in comparison with the 50% survival rate of the 1960s to 1970s .
Here we report the results of the Italian co-operative study after a median follow-up of 59 months and a minimum time between randomization and date last seen of 28 months among patients who did not die .
After a positive biopsy for sarcoma , all patients underwent complete staging and programmed local treatment .
A dose reduction scheme was defined to avoid excessive toxicity .
Under the auspices of the Italian National Council for Research (CNR) , 104 patients , 53 in the chemotherapy and 51 in the control arm , entered the study between June , 1992 and November , 1996 .
At the time of statistical analysis (November 1999) , the median follow-up for the 104 patients included in the study was 59 months , 61 months in the treatment arm and 55 months in the control arm .
The median overall DFS was 48 months among treated patients and 16 months in the control group .
Patients in the treated arm experienced a 41% reduction in the risk of disease relapse (HR , 0.59 , 95% CI , 0.36 to 0.99 , P = .04) (Fig 2) .
