Based on previous results and our own findings , the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research decided to accept perioperative adjuvant chemotherapy as the standard treatment for further clinical trials in colorectal cancer .
The Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research(SAKK) started one of these trials in 1981 to investigate the effectiveness of a perioperative intraportal cytotoxic regimen with fluorouracil and mitomycin .
Adjuvant chemotherapy reduced the risk of recurrence by 21 % and the risk of death by 26% .
This trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase survival in patients with colorectal cancer .
Patients were randomly assigned no adjuvant treatment (control group) or an immediate postoperative intraportal infusion of 500mg/m fluorouracil plus 5000 units heparin in 1 L 5% glucose per 24 h for 7 consecutive days (days 1-7) plus 10 mg/m mitomycin in a single dose on day 1 .
Disease-free survival was defined as the time from surgery to relapse , the appearance of a second primary cancer , or death , whichever occurred first .
All the others had observation times of at least 5 years at the time of this analysis .
Adjuvant portal chemotherapy was tolerated without an increase in complications compared with untreated patients .
The infusion group had fewer local recurrences and liver metastases with or without relapses at other sites than the control group (table 4) .
Patients were stratified according to where the tumour was (ascending , transverse , or descending/sigmoid colon , or rectum) and participating clinic .
The group assigned perioperative portal chemotherapy had significantly higher 5-year disease-free survival than the control group (table 2) .
Between July , 1981 , and March , 1987 , we enrolled 533 patients with adenocarcinoma of colon or rectum who were about to undergo curative resection and were younger than 75 years .
The hazard ratio for relapse (all events to mid-1992) of treated compared with untreated patients was 0-79 (95% CI 0.62-1.00 , p=0.051) .
Intraportal injection of cytotoxic agents at the time of surgery for colorectal cancer was advocated in 1957 to prevent liver metastases .
Adjuvant chemotherapy of colorectal cancer has been tested in several randomised trials .
