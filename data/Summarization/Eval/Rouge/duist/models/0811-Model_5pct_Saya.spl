In spite of the fact that the patients tested were in very good overall general condition with no previous chemotherapy exposure , none of our experimental regimens produced any meaningful advantage over therapy with simple 5-FU alone and none can be recommended for standard practice .
The purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate , by such a randomized and controlled comparison , a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5-FU activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials .
We chose for our evaluation the combinations of 5- FU with thymidine , with N-(phosphonacetyl)-Laspartic acid (PALA) , with levamisole , and with methyl CCNU , vincristine , and streptozotocin (MOF-Strept) .
A hope frequently pursued in clinical research has been that the activity of 5-FU can be enhanced either by adding the activity of other cytotoxic drugs or , more recently , by favorably modulating the effects of 5-FU itself .
The dose-limiting mucocutaneous toxicity that we observed undoubtedly represented the additive effects of both agents .
Martin has pointed out that it might be possible to obtain the full biochemical modulating effect of PALA by using a considerably lower dose of this agent , thereby allowing the 5-FU dose to be increased to near full therapeutic levels .
Further exploration of the 5-FU-PALA theme might be justified on this basis .
Although a large number of alternative drugs have been studied in colorectal cancer , none has exceeded the meager effectiveness of 5-FU .
