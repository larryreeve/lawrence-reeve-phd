The 5-year analysis had shown that a short , albeit intensive , postoperative course of antibody treatment (900 mg total dose)significantly reduced the appearance of distant metastases , but did not affect the rate of local relapses .
For the immediate future , adding antibody to chemotherapy seems logical to attack both dormant , as well as proliferating, metastatic tumor cells .
Here , we report on the 7-year follow-up study of this prospective randomized two-arm trial in minimal residual disease that used the murine 17-1A antibody, 4 which recognizes a 34-kd glycoprotein of the cell membrane ofepithelial cells .
In contrast to other trials aimed at patients with larger metastatic tumor masses and using regression or shrinkage as the end point, this one on colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C required microscopically complete resection of the primary tumor for patients to be admitted .
As the primary end point , overall-survival was determined at 5 years .
After confirmation of histology and R0 resection of lymph node metastasis , patients were randomized into two groups one received 17-lA treatment , whereas the other served as observation controls .
Patients in both groups were monitored in exactly the same way , with 14 prospectively defined follow-up visits , first on a quarterly and later on a half-year basis .
The dose of antibody chosen deserves a special comment
In the planning stage of the trial , we were afraid of a strong  anaphylactic response to repeated adnumstration of murine immunoglobulin .
We therefore resorted to a large , first intravenous dose that consisted of 500 mg highly soluble monomeric mmunoglobulin G2a to induce tolerance to mouse mmunoglobulin G .
Nevertheless , the high dose may have been critical to obtain a steep transvascular concentration gradient required for tissue penetration .
Why only one third of the patients at risk have responded to the antibody treatment may be explained by variations in accessibility , vulnerability , nd/or antigen expression in individual disseminated tumor cells .
Immunohistochemical staining of the primary tumor had shown that the antigen is expressed by most , but not all cells within an individual tumor .
By double staining of individual metastatic cells in bone marrow , it was shown that the 17-lA target is expressed by disseminated cells in only two thirds of the examined patients .
It is safe to assume that antigenic heterogeneity , a likely consequence of the marked genomic instability of human epithelial tumors , will be a major obstacle for single-antibody treatments , as well as for any other form of monotherapy .
Therefore , in anticipation of antigenic heterogeneity , a combination therapy that consists of antibodies of different specificities may forestall a selection of antigen-negative cells exerted inevitably by a one-antibody approach .
Furthermore , humanized antibodies or entirely human antibodies generated from human mmunoglobulin gene hbrarles that are less Immunogenic than murine antibodies are now being tested .
The discovery of the adhesion function of the 17-1A molecule , hence the new name EpCAM , raised the speculation that the antibody inhibited outgrowth of metastasis by interference with cell-cell adhesion .
When the two groups were compared with regard to the site of first recurrence , the 7-year data similar to the 5-year analysis show that significantly fewer distant recurrences occur in patients treated with the antibody than in the control arm (Fig 3) .
Therefore , the proposition is holding up that treatment with 17-1A may preferentially act on isolated tumor cells and thus prevent outgrowth ofdistant metastases .
The rather mild toxicity of 17-1A antibody has been described in detail in the 5-year report .
Since only acute and no chronic adverse effects were seen , the toxicity profile was not changed during the last observation period .
There were no late treatment-related fatalities or life-threatening conditions , or any evidence for chronic drug-related side effects .
As the 7-year median follow-up data confirm the previously reported 5-year findings , the conclusion seems warranted that antibody treatment improves the chances of curatively operated patients .
