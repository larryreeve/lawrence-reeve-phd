Adjuvant chemotherapy reduced the risk of recurrence by 21 % and  the risk of death by 26% .
This effect was observed in all subgroups , but was greatest in  patients with tumour-involved lymph nodes (33%) and in those with colon cancer  (22%) .
After median follow-up of 8 years we were not able to confirm the overall reduction of liver metastases reported by Taylor et al. We  did find , however , a consistent reduction of all kinds of tumour recurrences  that resulted in a significant advantage in overall survival and  disease-free survival for patients treated with adjuvant portal infusion , confirming previous findings .
Adjuvant portal chemotherapy was tolerated without an increase in complications compared with untreated patients .
Based on previous results and our own findings , the Swiss Group  for Clinical Cancer Research decided to accept perioperative adjuvant  chemotherapy as the standard treatment for further clinical trials in colorectal cancer .
The question of whether systemic chemotherapy gives a greater survival advantage than the less toxic intraportal administration remains unresolved .
This trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period  would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase  survival in patients with colorectal cancer .
The group assigned perioperative portal chemotherapy had significantly higher 5-year disease-free survival than the control group (table  2) .
The hazard ratio for relapse (all events to mid-1992) of treated  compared with untreated patients was 0-79 (95% CI 0.62- 1.00 , p=0.051) .
The infusion group had a higher rate of repeat laparotomy and  haemorrhage than the control group , especially after  abdominoperineal resection of rectal cancer .
