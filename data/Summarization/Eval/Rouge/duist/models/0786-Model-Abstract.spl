Purpose : To evaluate the contribution of semustine (MeCCNU) to adjuvant benefit , previously untreated patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum who had undergone curative resection were randomized to treatment with combination radiation therapy and fluorouracil (5-FU) followed by either 12 months of 5-FU and MeCCNU or 6 months of escalating 5-FU . 
Patients and Methods : Between March 1981 and November 1985 , 210 patients were randomized by Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG) investigators .
Subsequent to randomization , 11 (5%) patients (six treated with 5-FU and MeCCNU ; five with escalating 5-FU) were found to be ineligible and are excluded from survival analyses .
Results : About half the patients on each of the two treatment arms experienced at least one episode of severe or worse toxicity , and there was one treatmentrelated death on each arm .
No episodes of leukemia have been reported .
Median follow-up time for surviving patients is 5.8 years , and 3-year follow-up is available for all but five surviving patients .
Recurrent disease has been reported in 54% (51 of 95) of 5-FU- and MeCCNU-treated patients compared with 43% (45 of 104) of escalating 5-FU-treated patients .
Probability of 3-year disease-free survival for the two treatment cohorts is 54% and 68% , respectively .
Ninety-one deaths have occurred : 46% (44 of 95) of 5-FU- and MeCCNU-treated patients and 45% (47 of 104) of escalating 5-FU-treated patients .
Threeyear postsurgery survival probabilities are 66% and 75% . 
Conclusion : Substantial differences in survival or recurrence results between the two study arms are unlikely to be observed .
We conclude that MeCCNU is not an essential component of effective postoperative combined modality treatment of adjuvant rectal cancer .
