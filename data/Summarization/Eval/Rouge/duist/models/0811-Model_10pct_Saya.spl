In spite of the fact that the patients tested were in very good overall general condition with no previous chemotherapy exposure , none of our experimental regimens produced any meaningful advantage over therapy with simple 5-FU alone and none can be recommended for standard practice .
The purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate , by such a randomized and controlled comparison , a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5-FU activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials .
We chose for our evaluation the combinations of 5- FU with thymidine , with N-(phosphonacetyl)-Laspartic acid (PALA) , with levamisole , and with methyl CCNU , vincristine , and streptozotocin (MOF-Strept) .
A hope frequently pursued in clinical research has been that the activity of 5-FU can be enhanced either by adding the activity of other cytotoxic drugs or , more recently , by favorably modulating the effects of 5-FU itself .
The dose-limiting mucocutaneous toxicity that we observed undoubtedly represented the additive effects of both agents .
Martin has pointed out that it might be possible to obtain the full biochemical modulating effect of PALA by using a considerably lower dose of this agent , thereby allowing the 5-FU dose to be increased to near full therapeutic levels .
Further exploration of the 5-FU-PALA theme might be justified on this basis .
Although a large number of alternative drugs have been studied in colorectal cancer , none has exceeded the meager effectiveness of 5-FU .
Patients were then randomized to treatment with 5-FU alone , 5-FU plus PALA , 5-FU plus thymidine , 5-FU plus levamisole , or MOFStrept .
Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method .
There are imbalances between treatment arms in sex ratio , grade of anaplasia , and patients admitted to study with progressive pulmonary lesions but no histologic proof of metastasis .
It is noteworthy that while the MOF-Strept regimen had the highest regression rate , it was also the regimen with the lowest proportion of patients whose disease remained stable and the highest proportion of patients in whom the best response observed was tumor regression .
Whereas 5-FU plus PALA was associated with the lowest regression rate , these regressions were of the longest median duration .
The median survival for all patients was 81/4 months .
Grade of anaplasia also proved to be a powerful prognostic predictor .
If severe toxicity had been obtained with a previous treatment course , drug dosages were appropriately reduced with subsequent therapy . The primary endpoint of our overall study was patient survival .
