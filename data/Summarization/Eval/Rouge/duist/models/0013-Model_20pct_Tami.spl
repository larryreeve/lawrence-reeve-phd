Cisplatin is said to be the most active anticancer drug in cervical cancer ,  although 100 mg/m did not significantly improve the complete  response (CR) rate compared prospectively with 50 mg/m (12.7 v 10% ,   respectively) and there was no appreciable difference in response duration ,   progression-free interval (PFI) ,  or survival .
Thus ,  there is no convincing reason to use a cisplatindose higher than 50 mg/m .
Mitolactol (dibromodulcitol) is a hexitol derivative thatis converted into dianhydrogalactitol (DAG) in humanserum .
Previousstudies have shown activity for both DAG and mitolactol  in cervicalcancer .
Ifosfamide is a new agent closely related to cyclophosphamide ,   but with less marrow toxicity and more bladder toxicity that requires  concomitant use of the uroprotectormesna .
Eligible patients included women with histologically confirmed advanced(stage IVB) ,  recurrent ,  or persistent squamous cell  carcinoma of the cervix not suitable for curative treatment with surgery and/or  radiotherapy .
Patients were prospectively stratified according to whether they  had received prior radiation-sensitizer treatment (hydroxyurea ,  cisplatin , orfluorouracil) and by PS ,  and were then centrally randomized with equal probability to receive (1) cisplatin 50 mg/m with appropriate  hydrationevery 3 weeks for a maximum of six courses ,  or (2)  cisplatin 50 mg/m on day 1 plus mitolactol (180 mg/m orally for 5 days) on days 2 through 6  every 3 weeks ,  or (3) cisplatin 50mg/m plus ifosfamide 5.0 g/m over 24  hours plus mesna 6 g/m given concurrently with ifosfamide and for 12 hours  after ,  every 3 weeks ,  again for a maximum of six courses .
CR was defined as the disappearance of all gross evidence of disease for at least 4 weeks .
PR was a >= 50% reduction in theproduct obtained from the measurement of each lesion for at least 4 weeks .
The design for this study was based on the assumption that a 15% increase in the response rate due to the addition of either mitolactolor  ifosfamide to cisplatin would be regarded as clinically meaningful .
A linear logistic model was used to adjust for age ,  PS ,  and whether cisplatin had been used as a radiosensitizer .
The adjusted relative risk of survival and progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed with a linear proportional hazards model .
Between June 1990 and January 1994 ,  454 women entered the study  of whom 16 were ineligible (wrong stage ,  n = 2 ,  wrong cell type ,  n = 9 ,  wrong  primarytumor ,  n = 2 ,  prior chemotherapy ,  n = 2 ,  second primary  tumor ,  n = 1) ,  which left 438 eligible patients (including 10 who received no drug ,  all  wereincluded in the intent to-treat analysis) .
Thus ,  there were 140 eligible patients on the cisplatin arm ,  147 on the C + M arm ,  and 151 onthe CIFX arm .
There was more granulocytopenia ,  thrombocytopenia , and  leukocytopenia associated with C + M compared with cisplatin alone (P  < .025) .
Also ,  more granulocytopenia ,  thrombocytopenia ,  and nausea and vomiting were associated with CIFX versus cisplatin alone (P < .025)(Table 2) .
Peripheral (P = .013) and central neurotoxicity (P = .001) were  both significantly more frequent and severe with CIFX compared with  cisplatinalone (Table 3) ,  but not so for C + M .
There was a significantly greater frequency of response(31.1%)  among patients treated with CIFX compared with cisplatin alone (17.8% ,   P = .004 ,  Table 4) .
The frequency of response among those treated with C + M (21.1%) was only slightly greater than cisplatin and not statistically significant .
PFS (Fig 1) adjusted for age ,  PS ,  and prior cisplatinas a radiosensitizerwas statistically significantly longer for CIFX  (median ,  4.6 v 3.2 months) compared with cisplatin alone (P = .003) ,  however ,  there was no  differencebetween C + M and cisplatin alone .
There was no significant difference in survival between  cisplatin and either of the combination regimens (median[months] ,  cisplatin ,  8.0 ,  C +  M ,  7.3 ,  CIFX ,  8.3 ,  P =.835) (Fig 2) .
Age was associated with survival (P =.025) ,  with younger age  being unfavorable (Fig 3) ,  this ,  in turn ,  was correlated with a  shorter time from diagnosis to study entry .
The results of this trial in cervix cancer reflect a common set  of findingsin combination chemotherapy of advanced solid tumors ,   namely ,  a higher response rate (but not a high CR rate) with a combination compared  withsingle-agent therapy at the cost of more toxicity and no  survival benefit .
