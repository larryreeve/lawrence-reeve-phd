Our results and those of Browman et al do not support reports of superior efficacy for the sequential administration of MTX followed by 5-FU compared to other drug sequences .
Central telephone randomization used balanced blocks stratified only by primary site to assign one of two treatment sequences ,  either MTX followed one hour later by 5-FU (MF) or 5-FU followed .
In either case ,  the dose of MTX was 250 mg/m2 ,  and the dose of 5-FU was 600 mg/m2. Altogether ,  108 patients were entered ,  including 70 with head and neck cancer of whom 49 had received no prior chemotherapy ,  no radiotherapy ,  and no surgical treatment beyond diagnostic biopsy .
There were 24 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma ,  all with symptomatic advanced disease ,  and five with advanced gastric carcinoma .
The treatments were well tolerated in most patients ,  with a low incidence of hematologic and no significant renal toxicity (Table 2) ,  but occasional severe diarrhea or mucositis occurred ,  apparently despite normal renal function and FAR .
Both treatment sequences were effective in head and neck cancer ,  producing an overall major response rate (complete and partial) of 46% of all entered patients ,  including 52% (95% confidence limits ,  39%-65%) of evaluable patients .
Differences in response rates between treatment sequences were not statistically significant (Table 3) ,  but there was a consistent trend toward higher response rates in the groups receiving MF .
This was most extreme among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  of this subgroup 65% responded to the sequence of MF ,  while 39% of entered patients including 47% of those evaluable for response ,  responded to the reverse FM sequence (P = .18 ,  Fisher's exact test) .
Patients with head and neck cancer had significantly longer survival than those with other primary sites (P < .001) ,  reflecting the relatively earlier stage at which chemotherapy was used in head and neck cancer .
Survival duration was not significantly different by treatment sequence in univariate analyses ,  though the trend favored the sequence of 5-FU before MTX ,  in which the median survival had not been reached at 23 months ,  compared to a median survival of 13.3 months in the group receiving MTX before 5-FU .
Because the question at issue was the sequence of drug administration rather than the study of a particular tumor type ,  we chose to include patients with SCCs of the head and neck ,  colorectal or gastric adenocarcinoma ,  and other SCCs reasonably treated by either MTX or 5-FU .
Both treatments were effective in head and neck cancer (Table 3) .
In the small number of patients with colorectal cancer we observed a response rate of 33% (40% of evaluable patients) ,  a figure somewhat higher than that usually seen after 5-FU as a single agent ,  but the 95% confidence limits for this rate (19%-64%) emphasize that this could be a chance observation .
The median survival from the start of chemotherapy was short (4.6 months) with no significant difference between the two treatment sequences in response rate or survival duration (Table 3) .
In fact ,  no significant difference was observed between the toxicities of the two drug sequences (Table 2) ,  suggesting that neither synergy nor antagonism was displayed in the effects of either sequence on normal tissues .
The results do not support reports based on uncontrolled studies that sequential administration of MTX before 5-FU is important to the efficacy of this combination .
