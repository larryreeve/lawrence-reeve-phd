In spite of the fact that the patients tested were in very good overall general condition with no previous chemotherapy exposure , none of our experimental regimens produced any meaningful advantage over therapy with simple 5-FU alone and none can be recommended for standard practice .
With this background we initiated a randomized controlled comparison of 5-FU alone with 5-FU plus high-dose thymidine , 5-FU plus PALA , 5-FU plus levamisole , and MOF-Strept .
We elected to use survival as our primary endpoint in patients with both measurable and nonmeasurable disease and also to evaluate objective response rates among those patients with measurable disease .
Patients were then randomized to treatment with 5-FU alone , 5-FU plus PALA. 5-FU plus thymidine. 5-FU plus levamisole , or MOFStrept .
All patients were required to have histologic or cytologic confirmation of unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer .
A total of 347 patients were randomized on this study .
It is noteworthy that most of these patients were in excellent general condition .
None of the combination regimens showed a significant advantage to 5-FU used alone .
