We conducted a prospective ,  randomised study to compare external and internal radiotherapy with radical hysterectomy and node dissection .
Our main aim was to evaluate 5-year survival and the rate and pattern  of complications and recurrences associated with each procedure .
Eligibility criteria were ,  age 30-70 years ,  newly diagnosed stage Ib or  IIa cervical cancer ,  no concurrent or previous malignant disease ,  WHO performance status of 1 or less ,  and feasibility of both radical  surgery and radiotherapy .
The median total dose of radiation was 47 (range 40-53) Gy during 3-5  weeks ,  depending on the tumour volume and nodal status .
Radical surgery consisted of a class III radical abdominal  hysterectomy ,  as described by Piver and co-workers .
In patients aged 40 years or younger with squamous histology ,  one ovary  was preserved and suspended to the ipsilateral paracolic space outside the pelvis .
The primary outcome measures were 5-year overall survival and the rate  of complications .
The secondary outcome measure was recurrence of the disease .
Thus ,  169 in the surgery group and 158 in the radiotherapy group  underwent the scheduled treatment (compliance of 98% for surgery and 92% for radiotherapy) .
Median follow-up was 87 (range 57-120) months .
No patient was lost to follow-up .
11 patients died of intercurrent  disease and two from fatal complications (bowel perforation and pulmonary  embolism) .
The overall and disease-free actuarial 5-year survival for all patients  were 83% and 74% ,  respectively ,  and did not differ significantly between the groups (figure 2) .
5-year actuarial survival stratified by cervical  diameter was similar in the surgery and radiotherapy groups (diameter < 4 cm ,   87% vs 90% ,  diameter >4 cm ,  70% vs  72% ,  figure 3 ,  table 3) .
5-year actuarial disease-free survival for the surgery and radiotherapy groups was 80%  and 82% ,  respectively ,  for patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or  smaller ,  and 63% and 57% for those with a diameter larger than 4 cm ,  the between group differences were not significant .
The two groups did not differ significantly as regards squamous  histotype ,  overall 5-year survival rates were 84% in surgery-group patients and  88% in radiotherapy-group patients ,  overall disease-free survival was 76% and  78% ,  respectively .
For rates of adenocarcinoma there was a significant advantage for  patients who had surgery compared with those who had radiotherapy in both  overall survival (70% vs 59% ,  p=0.05) and disease-free survival (66% vs 47% ,  p=0.02) .
Overall ,  86 (25.5%) patients developed recurrent disease ,  42 (25%) in  the surgery group and 44 (26%) in the radiotherapy group .
In particular ,  among radiotherapy-group patients with cervical diameter larger than 4 cm ,  the rate of pelvic relapse was more than twofold the  rate of distant relapses (30% vs 13%) .
In addition ,  among women with a cervical  diameter larger than 4 cm ,   there was a significantly higher rate of pelvic relapse among those who had radiotherapy than among those who had surgery plus adjuvant irradiation  (16 [70%] vs 9 [53%] ,  p=0.46) .
Our review of the published research suggests that cure rates are  similar for patients with stage-I cervical cancers who undergo surgery or radiotherapy .
In our study ,  5-year actuarial survival was the same in the surgery and radiation groups (83%) ,  which suggests that there is no treatment of  choice with respect to local control of disease .
Surgery also offers other advantages ,  pelvic relapses can be  successfully cured by radiotherapy ,  whereas salvage surgery after primary  irradiation carries a high rate of failures and severe morbidity .
Furthermore ,  surgery allows the status of the lymph nodes ,  the most dependent variable associated with survival ,  to be assessed accurately .
By contrast ,  radiotherapy is easier to deliver for patients who are  obese ,  are elderly ,  or have severe illness-major contraindications to the  surgical approach .
Morbidity is associated with both treatment strategies ,  though the most severe complications ,  such as operative mortality ,  urological  complications ,  and tissue damage from irradiation ,  have been reduced during the past  20 years .
In our experience ,  the combination of surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy carries the worst morbidity ,  especially long-term (delayed in onset) complications ,  that are difficult to record during the follow-up .
Hydroureteronephroses ,  oedema of the lower limbs ,  various vesical complications ,  and bowel morbidity are more common and compromising in  women who undergo surgery plus radiotherapy .
On the other hand ,  the low rate of major complications after  radiotherapy (12%)  suggests that this approach is well-tolerated by most patients .
25% of the surgery-group patients and 26% patients in the radiotherapy group developed neoplastic recurrence .
The most important clinical risk factors that could indicate benefit of combined treatments are cervical diameter and lymph node status as  assessed by lymphangiography .
Histological type should be included in the selection criteria ,  because  our data show that radiotherapy was less effective than surgery for adenocardinoma of the cervix .
Women whose cervical diameters are larger than 4 cm should be  identified before surgery so that they can benefit from tailored treatment ,   radical radiotherapy ,  with the option of concomitant radiosensitising  chemotherapy to improve the local control of the disease ,  or cisplatinbased  chemotherapy followed by radical surgery .
