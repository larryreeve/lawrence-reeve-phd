Thus , adjunctive radiotherapy is beneficial for Stage I cervical cancer patients with clinical-pathological risk factors for recurrence other than positive nodes .
In 1988 the GOG initiated a prospective randomized study (GOG #92) , reported here , to investigate the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy for Stage I cervical cancer patients treated by conventional radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who were at high risk for recurrence , because of LTD , DSI , CLS , but excluding patients with lymph node metastases .
Certain clinical and pathologic risk factors for Stage 1 cervical cancer recurrence have been identified .
Traditionally , women with lymph node metastases have been treated with postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy .
Pelvic lymph node metastases , for example have been known to decrease the 5-year survival from 82 to 90% in patients with negative nodes to 38 to 61% in patients with positive lymph nodes .
Additional risk factors for recurrence , e.g. , large tumor diameter (LTD) , deep stromal invasion (DSI) , and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces (CLS) found on microscopic examination have been only recently recognized and less extensively investigated than lymph node metastases .
Several authors proposed that patients with certain primary tumorrelated factors such as LTD , DSI , and CLS might also benefit from postoperative radiotherapy .
Patients were eligible for the study if they had primary Stage IB squamous , adenosquamous carcinoma , or adenocarcinoma of cervix initially treated with a standard radical hysterectomy and who had negative lymph nodes but one of the previously described combination of risk factors .
