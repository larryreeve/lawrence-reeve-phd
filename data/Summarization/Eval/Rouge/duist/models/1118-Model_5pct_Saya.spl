In conclusion , when comparing patients with concurrent therapy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to radiotherapy alone , our study showed that concurrent multiagent chemoradiotherapy did not prove to be a superior definitive therapy for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
The purpose of this randomized trial was to assess whether the chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone for locally advanced cervical carcinoma . We also compared the toxicity of the two compared groups after planned treatment .
The concurrent use of radiation and chemotherapy , either as a single agent or in combination , has also been demonstrated to be effective in the local control of advanced carcinoma of the cervix with acceptable toxicity as presented by several reports , and was also supported by our previous phase I and II trial .
However , most series were nonrandomized and failed to achieve an improvement in long-term survival .
Thus , we designed the randomized trial to compare the tumor response and survival rate of patients with advanced cervical carcinoma receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus patients receiving radiotherapy alone .
Our study also revealed that the patterns of recurrences were not changed by the concomitant therapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
The most likely explanation for the poor results in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group is the higher treatmentrelated toxicity , and that could limit the dose of definitive radiation employed or interrupt the planned radiotherapy .
An equally likely explanation is the negative impact of prolonged treatment time caused by toxicity-induced delays .
