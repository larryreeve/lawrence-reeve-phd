The aim of this trial is to assess the effectiveness and toxicityof adjuvant post-operative RT vs combined RT and CT(5-FU plus levamisole) in patients with TNM stage II-IIIresectable rectal cancer (pT3-4 ,  pN0 ,  M0 ,  pTl-4 ,  pNl-3 , M0) .
The primary endpoint is overall survival ,  secondaryend points are disease-free survival ,  rate of loco-regionalrecurrence ,  and treatment-related toxicity/morbidity .
Within 42 days from surgery ,  patients randomized in Arm I receive RT (50 Gy) in daily fractions of 2 Gy ,  5 days/wk for 5 wk ,  to tumour bed and loco-regional lymph-nodes (internal iliac and presacral nodes) with four portals (LL and AP) .
Patients randomized in Arm II begin with the first cycle of 5-FU (450 mg/sqm/d iv bolus on days 1-5) plus ievamisole (150 mg/d orally on days 1-3) .
Post-oper ative RT is delivered during the next week at the same dosage and schedule as in Arm I .
Despite the short duration of the trial ,  these prelimina ry findings confirm the validity of the rationale with lower morbidity for radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy .
