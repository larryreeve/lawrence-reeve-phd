We found that the combination of pelvic radiation and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil was more effective for locally advanced cervical cancer than pelvic and para-aortic radiation alone .
The inclusion of chemotherapy substantially reduced both local and distant recurrences of cervical cancer , leading to higher overall and disease-free survival rates .
Although chemotherapy  increased the hematologic toxicity , this effect was reversible and the incidence of late side effects was similar in the two treatment groups .
We believe there is now sufficient evidence to recommend that women with locally advanced cervical cancer confined to the pelvis receive pelvic radiation concomitantly with treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil .
Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that overall survival rates were significantly better among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy than among those treated with radiotherapy alone (73 percent vs. 58 percent , P=0.004) (Table 5 and Fig. 1) .
Disease-free survivalat five years was 67 percent in the combined-therapy group and 40 percent in the radiotherapy group , according to Kaplan–Meier analysis (P<0.001) (Fig. 2) .
The rates of distant relapse were 14 percent in the combined-therapy group and 33 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) , with a relative risk of relapse of 0.39 (95 percent confidence interval , 0.24 to 0.63) in the combined-therapy group .
The rate of locoregional recurrences was 19 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 35 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) , with a relative risk of locoregional recurrences of 0.47 (95 percent confidence interval , 0.31 to 0.71) in the combined-therapy group .
There was no significant difference in overall survival between treatment groups among patients who had stage III or IVA disease , although  the study was not designed to have a sufficient number of patients in these subgroups to test for a statistically significant difference .
For patients with stage III or IVA disease , the five-year disease-free survival rates were 58 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 38 percent in the radiotherapy group (P=0.13) .
Approximately 70 percent of the patients assigned to each group had stage IB , IIA , or IIB disease .
For these patients , overall survival was significantly better if they were treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
Although moderate (grade 3) and severe (grade 4) side effects occurred more frequently during or within 60 days after the completion of treatment with combined therapy than with radiotherapy alone , these effects were usually self-limited or resolved with medical management (Table 3) .
A total of 403 patients were enrolled in the study between September 1990 and November 1997 , 201 were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy , and 202 were assigned to receive radiotherapy alone .
The 388 remaining patients (195 in the combined-therapy group and 193 in the radiotherapy group) form the basis of this analysis .
Radiotherapy was delivered according to the protocol or with minor deviations in 83 percent of the patients in the combined-therapy group and 84 percent of those in the radiotherapy group .
Of the 195 patients in the combination-therapy group , 159 (81 percent) completed at least two cycles of chemotherapy , and 133 (68 percent) completed three cycles .
The median duration of follow-up was 43 months .
We enrolled women of all ages who had stages IIB through IVA squamous-cell carcinoma , adenocarcinoma , or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix according to the staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (Table 1) or stage IB or IIA of one of these cancers with a tumor diameter of at least 5 cm or biopsy-proved metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes .
The patients in each treatment group were stratified according to the tumor stage (IB , IIA , or IIB vs. III or IVA) and the staging method used for para-aortic lymph nodes (clinical vs. surgical) .
External-beam radiation was delivered with anteroposterior and posteroanterior opposed beams of at least 15-MV photons or the use of four fields (anteroposterior , posteroanterior , and two lateral fields) of at least 4-MV photons .
The first intracavitary treatment was performed before or during external-beam radiotherapy , and additional external-beam therapy was delivered with a midline block .
