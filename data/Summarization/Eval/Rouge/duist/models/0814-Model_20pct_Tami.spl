The aim of this trial is to assess the effectiveness and toxicityof adjuvant post-operative RT vs combined RT and CT(5-FU plus levamisole) in  patientswith TNM stage II-IIIresectable rectal cancer (pT3-4 ,  pN0 ,   M0 ,  pTl-4 ,  pNl-3 , M0) .
From May 1992 to December 1994 ,  149 patients (80 males ,  69 females ,  age range 40-75 ,  median 64.7 years of age) with 0-2 (ECOG) performance  status(PS) were enrolled by the P.A.R. .
Within 42 days from surgery ,  patients randomized in Arm I receive RT (50 Gy) in daily fractions of 2 Gy ,  5 days/wk for 5 wk ,  to tumour bed and loco-regional lymph-nodes (internal iliac and presacral nodes)  with four portals (LL and AP) .
Patients randomized in Arm II begin with the first cycle of 5-FU  (450 mg/sqm/d iv bolus on days 1-5) plus ievamisole (150 mg/d orally  on days1-3) .
Post-operative RT is delivered during the next week at the same dosage and schedule as in Arm I .
Despite the short duration of the trial ,  these preliminary findings confirm the validity of the rationale with lower morbidity for  radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy .
