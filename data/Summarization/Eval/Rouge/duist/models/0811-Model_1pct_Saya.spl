In spite of the fact that the patients tested were in very good overall general condition with no previous chemotherapy exposure , none of our experimental regimens produced any meaningful advantage over therapy with simple 5-FU alone and none can be recommended for standard practice .
The purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate , by such a randomized and controlled comparison , a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5-FU activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials .
