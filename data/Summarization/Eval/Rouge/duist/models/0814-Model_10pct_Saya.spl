Despite the short duration of the trial , these preliminary findings confirm the validity of the rationale with lower morbidity for radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy .
The aim of this trial is to assess the effectiveness and toxicity of adjuvant post-operative RT vs. combined RT and CT(5-FU plus levamisole) in patients with TNM stage II-III resectable rectal cancer (pT3-4 , pN0 , M0 , pTl-4 , pNl-3 ,M0) .
The primary endpoint is overall survival , secondary end points are disease-free survival , rate of loco-regional recurrence , and treatment-related toxicity/morbidity .
