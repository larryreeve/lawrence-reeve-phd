This study showed that treatment with irinotecan and supportive care alone , compared with supportive care , prolonged the life of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer .
The trial we report was started in 1995 to compare irinotecan with supportive care alone for survival , quality  of life , and other clinical variables .
These data were supported by the quality-of-life analysis which suggested that the side-effects of irinotecan were favourably  balanced by reduced tumour-related events .
Furthermore , irinotecan improved the symptoms of patients and delayed the onset of tumour-related symptoms such as performance-status deterioration , weight loss , and pain .
This benefit was clinically meaningful because the probability of surviving 1 year was 2.6 times greater in patients given irinotecan compared with that of patients given supportive care alone .
Other efficacy endpoints , such as survival without weight loss , survival without performance status deterioration , pain-free survival , and quality-of-life , were all significantly in favour of irinotecan .
Overall survival was the primary endpoint .
