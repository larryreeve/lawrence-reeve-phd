In spite of the fact that the patients tested were in very good overall general condition with no previous chemotherapy exposure , none of our experimental regimens produced any meaningful advantage over therapy with simple 5-FU alone and none can be recommended for standard practice .
With this background we initiated a randomized controlled comparison of 5-FU alone with 5-FU plus high-dose thymidine , 5-FU plus PALA , 5-FU plus levamisole , and MOF-Strept .
We elected to use survival as our primary endpoint in patients with both measurable and nonmeasurable disease and also to evaluate objective response rates among those patients with measurable disease .
Patients were then randomized to treatment with 5-FU alone , 5-FU plus PALA. 5-FU plus thymidine. 5-FU plus levamisole , or MOFStrept .
All patients were required to have histologic or cytologic confirmation of unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer .
A total of 347 patients were randomized on this study .
It is noteworthy that most of these patients were in excellent general condition .
None of the combination regimens showed a significant advantage to 5-FU used alone .
It is noteworthy that while the MOF-Strept regimen had the highest regression rate , it was also the regimen with the lowest proportion of patients whose disease remained stable and the highest proportion of patients in whom the best response observed was tumor regression .
Whereas 5-FU plus PALA was associated with the lowest regression rate , these regressions were of the longest median duration .
There was no suggestion that any of the combination regimens performed in a superior fashion to 5-FU used alone , and it is unlikely that any could produce as much as a 50% increase in time to progression (P < .05) for each regimen v 5-FU alone .
The median interval to progression for all patients was 3/V2 months .
The median survival for all patients was 81/4 months .
MOF-Strept was characterized by substantially more frequent and more severe nausea and vomiting , and this was the only regimen characterized by a substantive incidence of thrombocytopenia .
5-FU plus PALA had substantially more frequent mucocutaneous reactions and somewhat more frequent diarrhea , but less hematologic toxicity than 5-FU alone or any of the other regimens .
On the other hand , 5-FU plus thymidine had a reduced incidence of mucocutaneous reactions and of diarrhea with comparable hematologic toxicity when compared with 5-FU alone .
