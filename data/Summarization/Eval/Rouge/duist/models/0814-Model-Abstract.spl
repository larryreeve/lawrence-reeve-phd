Loco-regional and distant relapses contribute to impair the outcome of rectal cancer patients) .
As to the former ,  eitherpre- or post-operative radiation therapy (RT) significantly reduce loco-regional recurrence; post-operative chemotherapy(CT) ,  alone or in different combinations with RT ,  is effective in improving both disease-free survival and survival .
However ,  many drawbacks still exist regarding the method of RT delivery as well as the toxicity of combination adjuvant chemotherapy .
The aim of this trial is to assess the effectiveness and toxicity of adjuvant post-operative RT vs combined RT and CT (5-FU plus levamisole) in patients with TNM stage II-III resectable rectal cancer (pT3-4 ,  pN0 ,  M0; pTl-4 ,  pNl-3 ,  M0) .
The primary endpoint is overall survival; secondary endpoints are disease-free survival ,  rate of loco-regional recurrence ,  and treatment-related toxicity/morbidity .
