In an effort to determine whether the improved survival in the Memorial Hospital Phase II trial was due to the combination of chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation therapy or due to the effect of the chemotherapy alone , a multicenter randomized Phase III clinical trial was designed .
The analysis of the data from the 89 patients entered is not able to document that the two treatments are equivalent , but must be taken to suggest that the likelihood of finding a significant difference between these two treatment modalities in a full trial of 160 patients is small .
Patients who met the entry criteria were given the opportunity to participate in this clinical trial , entry and initiation of therapy had to be within 6 weeks of the date of radical hysterectomy .
Overall and disease-free survival curves were computed using the method of Kaplan-Meier and the differences in survival were compared by the log-rank method .
