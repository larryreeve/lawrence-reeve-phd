In the present trial , there was a significant improvement in PFS associated with CIFX , however , its impact on the patient's sense of well-being was not assessed .
The result was impressive , but the importance of bleomycin was unclear and its toxicity sometimes troublesome , so we proposed to compare cisplatin alone versus a regimen of cisplatinplus mitolactol (C + M) and a regimen of cisplatin plusifosfamide (and mesna) (CIFX) .
Treatment of cervix cancer with the combination of ifosfamide , cisplatin , and bleomycin yielded a 69% response rate (49 patients) in one series .
Although we are not aware of such complications in the present trial , the possible risk of secondary malignancies plus the failure to show an improvement in outcome for C + M would suggest a limited future for mitolactol in the treatment of cervix cancer .
Cisplatin alone has limited value in advanced cervix cancer , we are not aware of a randomized trial of cisplatin versus supportive care .
Since there was no overall survival improvement , it is unclear to what extent the improvement in PFS or in response rate actually benefitted the patients .
The design for this study was based on the assumption that a 15% increase in the response rate due to the addition of either mitolactolor ifosfamide to cisplatin would be regarded as clinically meaningful .
Between June 1990 and January 1994 , 454 women entered the study of whom 16 were ineligible (wrong stage , n = 2 , wrong cell type , n = 9 , wrong primary tumor , n = 2 , prior chemotherapy , n = 2 , second primary tumor , n = 1) , which left 438 eligible patients (including 10 who received no drug , all were included in the intent to-treat analysis) .
Thus , there were 140 eligible patients on the cisplatin arm , 147 on the C + M arm , and 151 onthe CIFX arm .
There was a significantly greater frequency of response (31.1%) among patients treated with CIFX compared with cisplatin alone (17.8% , P = .004 , Table 4) .
The frequency of response among those treated with C + M (21.1%) was only slightly greater than cisplatin and not statistically significant .
The results of this trial in cervix cancer reflect a common set of findings in combination chemotherapy of advanced solid tumors , namely , a higher response rate (but not a high CR rate) with a combination compared with single-agent therapy at the cost of more toxicity and no survival benefit .
Eligible patients included women with histologically confirmed advanced (stage IVB) , recurrent , or persistent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix not suitable for curative treatment with surgery and/or radiotherapy .
Patients were prospectively stratified according to whether they had received prior radiation-sensitizer treatment (hydroxyurea , cisplatin , or fluorouracil) and by PS , and were then centrally randomized with equal probability to receive (1) cisplatin 50 mg/m with appropriate hydration every 3 weeks for a maximum of six courses , or (2) cisplatin 50 mg/m on day 1 plus mitolactol (180 mg/m orally for 5 days) on days 2 through 6 every 3 weeks , or (3) cisplatin 50mg/m plus ifosfamide 5.0 g/m over 24 hours plus mesna 6 g/m given concurrently with ifosfamide and for 12 hours after , every 3 weeks , again for a maximum of six courses .
In contrast , the present trial , which used cisplatin 50 mg/m2 plus ifosfamide , has shown an impact on PFS .
Perhaps this is a step in the right direction , albeit with more toxicity .
In fact , this appears to be the first evidence of an impact of a chemotherapy regimen on PFS in advanced cervix cancer .
Whether this can be translated into a survival benefit by the addition of bleomycin remains to be determined .
