In conclusion , the 5-yr results of our randomized study confirm that CMF , particularly when delivered at nearly full doses , can indeed alter the postoperative course of breast cancer with positive axillary nodes .
The 5-yr results of the present study are now sufficiently mature to indicate with confidence that 6 cycles of CMF are equivalent to 12 cycles in terms of RFS and total survival .
`In fact , in all variables examined , none of the two treatments under evaluation was significantly different from the other .
The most important practical aspect of our current study is at which point a single drug combination has provided all the benefit possible , i.e. , maximal tumor cytoreduction , in the majority of patients .
The presence of specifically multidrug-resistant phenotypes limits the therapeutic effectiveness of a single combination and renders its prolonged administration unnecessary .
Effective adjuvant combination chemotherapy seems to be unaffected by ER status , at least when RFS is considered .
The reason(s) why RFS was not improved by prolonging chemotherapy once pathologic complete remission has been achieved , in our own trial and in other adjuvant trials for breast cancer , as well as in a variety of neoplastic diseases , can now be interpreted by considering the problem of specifically multidrug-resistant phenotypes .
Based on our current findings , i.e. , therapeutic efficacy of adjuvant CMF regardless of ER status , there seems to be no clinical reason to withhold the administration of adjuvant combination chemotherapy in node positive women even in the presence of ER + tumors .
The first and most important one is that there appears to be no real difference following adjuvant chemotherapy , namely CMF , between the RFS of pre- versus postmenopausal women (CMF 12 , 59.3% versus 57.6% , CMF 6 , 66.5% versus 63.1% , respectively) .
