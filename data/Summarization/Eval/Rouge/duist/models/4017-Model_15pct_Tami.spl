The results we achieved with the irinotecan combination treatment show that the addition of irinotecan to weekly or 2-weekly regimens of fluorouracil and calcium folinate by infusion brings clear clinical benefit and should be considered as a first-line reference treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer as well as for advanced disease .
We did a phase III multicentre randomised trial that was designed to assess whether the addition of irinotecan to fluorouracil and calcium folinate would benefit patients previously untreated with chemotherapy (other than adjuvant) for metastatic colorectal cancer .
Combination of irinotecan with fluorouracil and calcium folinate significantly increased response rates , time to progression , and survival .
In the evaluable population , the response rate was 49% in the irinotecan group , compared with 31% in the noirinotecan group (p<0.001) .
Survival in the irinotecan group was significantly than in the no-irinotecan group(median 17.4 [0.4-28.4+] vs 14.1 [0.5-27.6+] months , p=0.031;figure3) .
The probability of survival in the irinotecan group was 82.1% at 9 months and 69.1% at 12 months , and in the noirinotecan group was 71.6% and 59.1% , respectively .
In the intention-to-treat population , response rate was also significantly higher in the irinotecan group than in the noirinotecan group (34.8 [28.2-41.9] vs 21.9% [16.2-28.5] , p=0.005 , table 2) .
The median time to onset of response was 8.9 (range 4.7-25.4) weeks in the irinotecan group and 11.4 (5.3-29.6) weeks in the no-irinotecan group .
Duration of response and stabilisation was longer in the irinotecan group (8.6 [1.6-13.6] vs 6.2 [1.1-11.8] months , p<0.001) .
Time to progression was longer in the irinotecan than in the noirinotecan group (median 6.7 [0+.13.8+] vs 4.4 group and the no-irinotecan group , 33.1% (95% CI 25.5-41.4) and 21.0% (14.6-28.6 , p=0.021) , median time to progression was 6.5 (range 0+.13.2) months and 3.7 (0+.13.1+) months (p=0.001) , and median survival was 17.4 (0.4-28.3+) months and 13.0 (0.5-27.6+) months .
In the irinotecan group , diarrhoea and neutropenia were the most common toxic effects in each regimen , and were significantly more frequent and severe than in the noirinotecan group .
Doses were reduced because of toxic effects more frequently for the weekly regimen than for the 2-weekly regimen , and more in the irinotecan than in the noirinotecan group .
When missing data for death , progressive disease , or grade 3.4 adverse events were taken into account with the two imputation methods , results were biased in favour of the no-irinotecan group .
The median duration of treatment was longer in the irinotecan than in the no-irinotecan group , irrespective of regimen (24.0 vs 21.0 weeks for the weekly regimen , 24.6 vs 18.0 for the 2-weekly regimen) .
387 patients were randomly assigned treatment. 385 patients received at least one infusion .
The time to definitive deterioration in performance status was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group (median 11.2 [0.1+.15.7+]) vs 9.9 [0+.13¡¤6+] months , p=0.046 , figure 4 ) .
There was insufficient power to compare the efficacy between groups in the weekly regimen because of the small number of patients who received this regimen .
In the initention-to-treat analysis of the 2-weekly regimen , the response rate was , for the irinotecan group and the no-irinotecan group , 33.1% (95% CI 25.5-41.4) and 21.0% (14.6-28.6 , p=0.021); median time to progression was 6y.5 (range 0+-13.2) months and 3.7 (0+-13.1+) months and 13.0 (0.5-27.6+) months .
In the irinotecan group , the relative dose intensity was 0.82 for irinotecan and 0.81 for fluorouracil in the weekly regimen , and 0.93 and 0.92 , respectively , in the 2-weekly regimen .
In the no-irinotecan group , the relative dose intensity was 0.90 in the weekly regimen and 0.96 in the 2-weekly regimen .
Our primary endpoint was response rate .
The secondary endpoints for efficacy were time to progression , duration of response , time to treatment failure , and overall survival .
We needed to include 338 evaluable patients to show a significant difference in response rate between treatment groups , assuming response rates of 35% in the no-irinotecan group and 50% in the irinotecan group , by use of two-tailed X tests (a=0.05 , power 0.80) .
