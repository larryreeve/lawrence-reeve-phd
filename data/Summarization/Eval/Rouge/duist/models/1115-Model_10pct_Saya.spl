The number of patients is too few to recommend that concurrent infusional 5-FU with pelvic irradiation should become the standard therapy for these patients .
From the subset analysis of this trial we have generated the hypothesis that there may be a beneficial effect of adding concurrent infusional 5-FU to standard in patients with the disease characteristics of stratum 1 .
Since the data are not conclusive because of limited numbers , confirmation of the beneficial effects observed in this study is necessary .
Interest in infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with or without other agents such as mitomycin C and cisplatin , developed from both laboratory data suggesting enhanced tumor cell kill over radiation alone and clinical data .
In vitro data suggested that the addition of infusional 5-FU to radiation therapy would enhance the radiation effect .
Between May of 1987 and August of 1995 , 234 patients predominantly from two centers , with others participating , were stratified by their extent of pelvic disease and randomized to receive one of four possible treatments .
Stratification was based on a retrospective analyses which defined subgroups with different prognoses based on a combination of FIGO stage and pelvic disease volume .
Patients were randomized to receive either (a) standard external beam pelvic irradiation (EBRT) in a dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions defined at 100% versus , (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional intravenous 5-FU in a dose of 1 g/m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of RT , (c) partially hyperfractionated RT , 5280 cGy in 33 fractions , 2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of RT , or (d) arm (c) with the same infusional 5-FU .
The outcomes of interest in this study were pelvic control , survival , and disease-free survival , as well as the serious late complication rate .
The ''Lifetest Procedure'' in SAS UNIX was used to compare survival curves .
This procedure uses the Kaplan-Meier method that calculates the ranked test pooled across the strata adjusting for strata differences .
Cox's proportional hazards model was used to examine the variables which might contribute to pelvic control or survival within stratum 1 .
There is no significant difference in the overall 5-year disease-free survival between the treatment arms .
There was a significant improvement in 5-year survival and disease-free survival for those treated with standard radiation and 5-FU compared to the other treatments (log rank test P 5 0.05) .
The actuarial 5-year disease-free survival was 76% compared to 65% for hyperfractionated irradiation plus 5-FU , 58% for hyperfractionated irradiation alone , and 39% for standard radiation .
Similar differences were observed in pelvic control , but the addition of 5-FU to standard radiation resulted in a greater improvement in disease-free survival than in pelvic control .
There was no apparent increase in late complications associated with the addition of 5-FU .
The 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 62% for those treated with hyperfractionated irradiation and was not significantly different from the 58% survival of those treated with standard irradiation .
The median duration of follow up on this series at 59 months is sufficient to observe approximately 80% of expected events .
The only significant factor predicting for disease-free survival was the use of 5-FU .
The mechanism by which 5-FU exerts benefit is unknown , but may be simply by additivity due to its independent cytotoxic effect rather than to an interaction with radiation .
