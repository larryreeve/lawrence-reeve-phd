We found that the combination of pelvic radiation and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil was more effective for locally advanced cervical cancer than pelvic and para-aortic radiation alone .
The inclusion of chemotherapy substantially reduced both local and distant recurrences of cervical cancer , leading to higher overall and disease-free survival rates .
Although chemotherapy  increased the hematologic toxicity , this effect was reversible and the incidence of late side effects was similar in the two treatment groups .
We believe there is now sufficient evidence to recommend that women with locally advanced cervical cancer confined to the pelvis receive pelvic radiation concomitantly with treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil .
Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that overall survival rates were significantly better among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy than among those treated with radiotherapy alone (73 percent vs. 58 percent , P=0.004) (Table 5 and Fig. 1) .
Disease-free survivalat five years was 67 percent in the combined-therapy group and 40 percent in the radiotherapy group , according to Kaplan–Meier analysis (P<0.001) (Fig. 2) .
The rates of distant relapse were 14 percent in the combined-therapy group and 33 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) , with a relative risk of relapse of 0.39 (95 percent confidence interval , 0.24 to 0.63) in the combined-therapy group .
The rate of locoregional recurrences was 19 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 35 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) , with a relative risk of locoregional recurrences of 0.47 (95 percent confidence interval , 0.31 to 0.71) in the combined-therapy group .
There was no significant difference in overall survival between treatment groups among patients who had stage III or IVA disease , although  the study was not designed to have a sufficient number of patients in these subgroups to test for a statistically significant difference .
For patients with stage III or IVA disease , the five-year disease-free survival rates were 58 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 38 percent in the radiotherapy group (P=0.13) .
Approximately 70 percent of the patients assigned to each group had stage IB , IIA , or IIB disease .
For these patients , overall survival was significantly better if they were treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
Although moderate (grade 3) and severe (grade 4) side effects occurred more frequently during or within 60 days after the completion of treatment with combined therapy than with radiotherapy alone , these effects were usually self-limited or resolved with medical management (Table 3) .
A total of 403 patients were enrolled in the study between September 1990 and November 1997 , 201 were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy , and 202 were assigned to receive radiotherapy alone .
The 388 remaining patients (195 in the combined-therapy group and 193 in the radiotherapy group) form the basis of this analysis .
