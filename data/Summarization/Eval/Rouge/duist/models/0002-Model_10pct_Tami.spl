Our results demonstrate the superiority of radiotherapy and chemotherapy either with cisplatin alone or with cisplatin , fluorouracil , and hydroxyurea in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (stage IIB , III , or IVA without metastasis to the para-aortic lymph nodes) .
Treatment with cisplatin alone was less toxic than treatment with the three-drug regimen .
We recommend cisplatin as the standard drug for radiotherapy and chemotherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer .
The relative risk of progression of disease or death was 0.57 (95 percent confidence interval , 0.42 to 0.78) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0.55 (95 percent confidence interval , 0.40 to 0.75) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin , fluorouracil , and hydroxyurea , as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy , after adjustment for the clinical stage of disease .
Patients who received the platinum-based regimens had significantly longer progression-free survival than those who received hydroxyurea (P<0.001 for both comparisons) (Fig. 1) .
The rates of progression-free survival at 24 months were 67 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy , 64 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin , fluorouracil , and hydroxyurea , and 47 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
After adjustment for the clinical stage of disease , the relative risk of death was 0.61 (95 percent confidence interval , 0.44 to 0.85) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0.58 (95 percent confidence interval , 0.41 to 0.81) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin , fluorouracil , and hydroxyurea , as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
Survival rates were also significantly better in these two groups (P=0.004 and P=0.002 , respectively) than in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy (Fig. 2) .
Patients in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin , fluorouracil , and hydroxyurea had less local progression (19 percent and 20 percent , respectively) than those in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy (30 percent) .
The frequencies of both grade 3 and grade 4 leukopenia in the group given radio-therapy combined with treatment with cisplatin , fluorouracil , and hydroxyurea were more than double the frequencies in the other two groups (P<0.001) .
