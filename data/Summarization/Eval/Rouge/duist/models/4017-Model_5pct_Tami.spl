The results we achieved with the irinotecan combination treatment show that the addition of irinotecan to weekly or 2-weekly regimens of fluorouracil and calcium folinate by infusion brings clear clinical benefit and should be considered as a first-line reference treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer as well as for advanced disease .
We did a phase III multicentre randomised trial that was designed to assess whether the addition of irinotecan to fluorouracil and calcium folinate would benefit patients previously untreated with chemotherapy (other than adjuvant) for metastatic colorectal cancer .
Combination of irinotecan with fluorouracil and calcium folinate significantly increased response rates , time to progression , and survival .
In the evaluable population , the response rate was 49% in the irinotecan group , compared with 31% in the noirinotecan group (p<0.001) .
Survival in the irinotecan group was significantly than in the no-irinotecan group(median 17.4 [0.4-28.4+] vs 14.1 [0.5-27.6+] months , p=0.031;figure3) .
The probability of survival in the irinotecan group was 82.1% at 9 months and 69.1% at 12 months , and in the noirinotecan group was 71.6% and 59.1% , respectively .
In the intention-to-treat population , response rate was also significantly higher in the irinotecan group than in the noirinotecan group (34.8 [28.2-41.9] vs 21.9% [16.2-28.5] , p=0.005 , table 2) .
The median time to onset of response was 8.9 (range 4.7-25.4) weeks in the irinotecan group and 11.4 (5.3-29.6) weeks in the no-irinotecan group .
