There is no significant difference in the overall 5-year disease-free survival between the treatment arms .
Between May of 1987 and August of 1995  , 234 patients predominantly from two centers  , with others participating  , were stratified by their extent of pelvic disease and randomized to receive one of four possible treatments .
Patients were randomized to receive either (a) standard external beam pelvic irradiation (EBRT) in a dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions defined at 100% versus  , (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional intravenous 5-FU in a dose of 1 g/m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of RT  , (c) partially hyperfractionated RT  , 5280 cGy in 33 fractions  , 2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of RT  , or (d) arm (c) with the same infusional 5-FU .
The original statistical design required 292 patients but the study was closed early due to poor accrual .
The outcomes of interest in this study were pelvic control  , survival  , and disease-free survival , as well as the serious late complication rate .
One hundred and eighty-seven of 221 patients had squamous cell carcinoma , 17 adenocarcinoma , 12 adenosquamous , and the remainder clear cell or unclassified .
With a median duration of follow-up of 59 months , 119 of 221 patients are alive , 111 without evidence of disease , and 8 with disease present .
The disease free 5-year survival in arm (a) , (c) , (d) , and (b) , respectively ,were 45 , 53 , 58 , and 61% .
The overall pelvic control by treatment assigned for arms (a) , (c) , (d) , and (b) was 58 , 65 , 68 , and 69% , respectively .
Whereas there was once again a trend in favor of concurrent 5-FU , particularly in combination with standard radiation , the difference was not statistically significant .
All patients were to have tumors 5 cm or greater regardless of FIGO stage (stages IB  , II  , IVA) .
