The trial we report was started in 1995 to compare irinotecan with supportive care alone for survival , quality  of life , and other clinical variables .
The participants were  patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in whom fluorouracil chemotherapy had failed .
This study showed that treatment with irinotecan and supportive care alone , compared with supportive care , prolonged the life of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer .
This benefit was clinically meaningful because  the probability of surviving 1 year was 2.6 times greater in patients given irinotecan compared with that of patients given supportive care alone .
Other efficacy endpoints , such as survival without weight loss , survival  without performance status deterioration , pain-free survival , and quality-of-life , were all significantly in  favour of irinotecan .
The survival advantage for the irinotecan group remained highly significant after adjustment of performance status , a well-recognised prognostic  factor .
Furthermore , irinotecan improved the symptoms of patients and delayed the onset of  tumour-related symptoms such as performance-status deterioration , weight loss , and pain .
