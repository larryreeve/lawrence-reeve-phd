Thus , adjunctive radiotherapy is beneficial for Stage I cervical cancer patients with clinical-pathological risk factors for recurrence other than positive nodes .
In 1988 the GOG initiated a prospective randomized study (GOG #92) , reported here , to investigate the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy for Stage I cervical cancer patients treated by conventional radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who were at high risk for recurrence , because of LTD , DSI , CLS , but excluding patients with lymph node metastases .
Certain clinical and pathologic risk factors for Stage 1 cervical cancer recurrence have been identified .
Traditionally , women with lymph node metastases have been treated with postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy .
Pelvic lymph node metastases , for example have been known to decrease the 5-year survival from 82 to 90% in patients with negative nodes to 38 to 61% in patients with positive lymph nodes .
Additional risk factors for recurrence , e.g. , large tumor diameter (LTD) , deep stromal invasion (DSI) , and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces (CLS) found on microscopic examination have been only recently recognized and less extensively investigated than lymph node metastases .
Several authors proposed that patients with certain primary tumorrelated factors such as LTD , DSI , and CLS might also benefit from postoperative radiotherapy .
Patients were eligible for the study if they had primary Stage IB squamous , adenosquamous carcinoma , or adenocarcinoma of cervix initially treated with a standard radical hysterectomy and who had negative lymph nodes but one of the previously described combination of risk factors .
After the eligibility criteria were verified , patients were randomly assigned to one of the two regimens , pelvic radiation or no further therapy .
Both large tumor diameter and deep stromal invasion are indices of large tumor volume , conceivably affecting cancer progression and its metastatic spread .
Of the three risk factors , depth of invasion seems the most objective and accurate method-a direct measurement on the histological slide .
Nevertheless , we found tumor diameter to be the most significant risk factors in the Cox model analysis of our study results , confirming multiple data sets which demonstrate that the size of the primary cancer is critical for local control despite the imprecision of measurement .
Patients received external beam irradiation and no brachytherapy .
All histology slides were reviewed by two pathologists of the GOG Pathology
Committee who measured the depth of stromal invasion expressed in thirds of cervical thickness and ascertained the presence or absence of the capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement and the tumor cell type .
The primary outcome variable was recurrence-free interval (RFI) .
