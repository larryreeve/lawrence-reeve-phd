The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment , but they share a common result , all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin .
We elected to test this combination in a phase 3 trial to determine whether concurrent weekly treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy would improve progression-free survival and survival in women with large "bulky" or barrel-shaped , stage IB cervical cancers .
Several phase 2 studies have reported that concomitant treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy results in faster and more complete responses and better survival than expected with radiotherapy alone .
This remarkable consistency offers a compelling reason to consider cisplatin therapy in combination with radiotherapy as a new standard of care for patients with bulky stage IB , stage IIB through IVA , and high-risk cervical cancers .
The risk of recurrence and death was significantly reduced by concurrent treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy .
It is reasonable to conclude on the basis of these results and our results that the elimination of hysterectomy from both regimens would not have affected the increase in survival associated with the use of cisplatin .
Therefore , we chose to test the value of concurrent treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy followed by hysterectomy as compared with that of radiotherapy alone followed by hysterectomy .
The use of extrafascial hysterectomy after radiotherapy has gradually been abandoned , but there has continued to be disagreement about the value of the operation .
All patients were scheduled to undergo external irradiation , intracavitary brachytherapy , and extrafascial hysterectomy , with half the patients randomly assigned to receive weekly intravenous infusions of cisplatin during the period of radiotherapy .
Cisplatin was given intravenously once a week at a dose of 40 mg per square meter of body-surface area , with the total dose not to exceed 70 mg per week . A maximum of six doses of cisplatin was given .
Extrafascial hysterectomy was performed three to six weeks after the completion of radiotherapy .
The primary end points were progression-free survival and survival .
Randomization was carried out by a block arrangement , the treatment assignments were stratified according to center and to whether para-aortic lymph nodes were evaluated surgically , with approximately equal numbers of patients assigned to each group .
Cox multiple regression analysis showed that the size of the tumor as assessed by physical examination and the histologic grade of the tumor were both significant prognostic factors .
