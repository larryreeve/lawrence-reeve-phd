The results of this study indicate that treatment after surgical resection of Dukes B2 and C rectal cancer with escalating 5-FU postradiation therapy provides similar survival and recurrence outcomes as a postradiation chemotherapeutic regimen including the leukemogen MeCCNU .
Both survival and disease-free survival results favor the escalating 5-FU arm , although these differences did not reach statistical significance .
Fewer recurrences involving distant sites occurred on the escalating 5-FU arm compared with the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm , further suggesting that MeCCNU is not an essential component of the postradiation chemotherapy treatment .
Although similar rates of local recurrence were experienced on the two study arms , the similarity in outcome is not surprising as both arms used identical postsurgery radiation therapy regimens including 5-FU .
The results of this study show that comparable results can be achieved using a combination regimen that does not include MeCCNU , this conclusion is also supported by preliminary data reported by the NCCTG .
The increased leukemicpotential of MeCCNU makes the drug additionally undesirable to include in the adjuvant setting .
Therefore , we conclude that MeCCNU is not an essential component of effective postoperative combined modality treatment of adjuvant rectal cancer and should not be included in future treatment regimens .
Of the 199 patients who comprised the cohort for primary analysis , 95 were randomized to receive postradiation 5-FU and MeCCNU , and 104 were randomized to receive postradiation escalating 5-FU .
A total of 91 deaths have been reported , 46% (44 of 95) on 5-FU and MeCCNU and 45% (47 of 104) on 5-FU .
