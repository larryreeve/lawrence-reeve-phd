In our study  , 5-year actuarial survival was the same in the surgery and radiation groups (83%)  , which suggests that there is no treatment of choice with respect to local control of disease .
The overall and disease-free actuarial 5-year survival for all patients were 83% and 74%  , respectively  , and did not differ significantly between the groups (figure 2). 5-year actuarial survival stratified by cervical diameter was similar in the surgery and radiotherapy groups (diameter < 4 cm  , 87% vs 90%  , diameter >4 cm  , 70% vs 72%  , figure 3  , table 3). 5-year actuarial disease-free survival for the surgery and radiotherapy groups was 80% and 82%  , respectively , for patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or smaller , and 63% and 57% for those with a diameter larger than 4 cm , the between group differences were not significant .
Overall , 86 (25·5%) patients developed recurrent disease , 42 (25%) in the surgery group and 44 (26%) in the radiotherapy group .
The two groups did not differ significantly as regards squamous histotype , overall 5-year survival rates were 84% in surgery-group patients and 88% in radiotherapy-group patients , overall disease-free survival was 76% and 78% , respectively .
For rates of adenocarcinoma there was a significant advantage for patients who had surgery compared with those who had radiotherapy in both overall survival (70% vs 59% , p=0·05) and disease-free survival (66% vs 47% , p=0·02) .
The median time to recurrence did not differ significantly between the surgery and radiotherapy groups (20 vs 18 months , p=0·24). 82% of pelvic recurrences and 61% of the distant ones became evident within 2 years of the primary treatment .
This finding should resolve some of the conflicting approaches to this issue.14–16 Our results suggest that the optimum candidates for primary radical surgery are women with normal ovarian function and cervical diameters of 4 cm or smaller , whereas radiotherapy is preferable for postmenopausal women .
2 Women whose cervical diameters are larger than 4 cm should be identified before surgery so that they can benefit from tailored treatment , radical radiotherapy , with the option of concomitant radiosensitising chemotherapy to improve the local control of the disease , or cisplatinbased chemotherapy followed by radical surgery .
