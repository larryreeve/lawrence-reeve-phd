Fifty-four patients with advanced breast cancer who had failed prior nonanthracycline combination chemotherapy were randomized to treatment  with either epirubicin 85 mg/m2 or doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 intravenously every  three weeks .
The median duration of response to epirubicin was 11.9 months compared  to 7.1 months with doxorubicin .
Laboratory evidence of cardiotoxicity was defined as a decrease in  resting left ventricular ejection fraction of > 10% from the baseline value ,  or  a decrease of 5% or greater with exercise compared with the resting study performed on the same day .
Fifteen patients treated with epirubicin and 18 patients treated with doxorubicin had at least two determinations of left ventricular  ejection fraction and were evaluable for laboratory cardiotoxicity .
Using methods of survival analysis ,  the median doses to the development  of laboratory cardiotoxicity were estimated to be 935 mg/m2 of epirubicin  and 468 mg/m2 of doxorubicin .
Four patients treated with epirubicin and five treated with doxorubicin developed symptomatic congestive heart failure .
The median cumulative dose at which congestive heart failure occurred  was 1,134 mg/m2 of epirubicin compared with 492 mg/m2 of doxorubicin .
It is a stereoisomer of DOX in which the hydroxyl group at the 4'  position of the aminosugar side chain is epimerized (Fig 1) .
The antitumor activity of EPI in animal models is similar to that of  DOX ,  but EPI is a less toxic compound with regard to both cytotoxicity and cardiac injury .
Pharmacokinetic studies in tumor-bearing mice and rats indicate that  EPI is more extensively metabolized by liver than DOX .
We used multigated radionuclide cineangiocardiography (RNCA) to assess cardiac toxicity in this prospective ,  randomized study comparing the efficacy ,  acute ,  and chronic toxicities of EPI with DOX in patients  with advanced breast cancer .
This study was conducted in  patients with advanced breast cancer who had progressed after receiving  combination chemotherapy .
Patients whose prior treatment included an anthracycline were excluded  from this study .
After determining eligibility ,  informed consent was  obtained .
Both EPI and DOX were administered by slow (five minute) injections  through an established IV line every three weeks .
A total of 54 women were randomized ,  25  to the EPI arm and 29 to the DOX arm .
In general ,  the nausea and vomiting in patients on the EPI arm was less severe .
Each patient had a baseline RNCA scan ,  and in all  patients the resting LVEF was > 50% with the exception of one patient in whom it  was 48% .
Fifteen patients on the EPI arm and 18 patients on the DOX arm had at  least one followup RNCA and were evaluable for laboratory cardiotoxicity .
Of the 15 evaluable patients treated with EPI ,  six had received prior radiotherapy to the chest wall ,  internal mammary lymph nodes ,  sternum ,   or thoracic spine prior to entry on this study ,  and two had a history of well-controlled mild hypertension .
Of the 18 evaluable patients treated with DOX ,  seven had prior  radiation exposure to the heart ,  two had hypertension ,  and two had both  hypertension and prior radiotherapy .
Eight patients treated with EPI and nine patients treated with DOX had laboratory evidence of cardiotoxicity .
The median cumulative dose to laboratory cardiotoxicity in these  patients was 892 mg/m2 of EPI and 360 mg/m 2 of DOX .
The median dose to development of cardiotoxicity for all evaluable  patients was 935 mg/m2 for EPI and 468 mg/m2 for DOX (Fig 2A) .
The difference is highly significant (log rank test ,  P < .0001) .
Four patients treated with EPI and five patients treated with DOX  developed clinical congestive heart failure (CHF) .
The cumulative doses of EPI at which clinical CHF was observed (1,035 ,  1,105 ,  1,162 ,  and 1,234 mg/m 2) were approximately twice the cumulative doses of DOX at which CHF was seen (456 ,  480 ,  492 ,  560 ,  and 600 mg/m2) .
Among patients who experienced clinical CHF ,  however ,  the median  cumulative doses to CHF were 1,134 mg/m2 of EPI and 492 mg/m 2 of DOX .
In this study ,  EPI had therapeutic activity in breast cancer similar to DOX ,  but produced less cardiotoxicity than the parent  compound .
Long-term administration of DOX on a conventional every three week  schedule is limited by the development of dose-related congestive  cardiomyopathy .
Structurally ,  EPI differsvery slightly from DOX and has the same  molecular weight ,  yet EPI and DOX have different therapeutic ,  myelosuppressive ,   and cardiotoxic potencies in animal systems .
The observed major therapeutic response rate to EPI (25%) was identical  to that observed with DOX (25%) .
On a molar basis ,  EPI was clearly less myelosuppressive than DOX ,  EPI  was also less cardiotoxic .
The difference in cardiac toxicity was manifested by the difference in  total cumulative dose at which changes in LVEF occurred (Fig 2A) ,  as well as  by the difference in dose a t which clinical CHF was seen (EPI ,  1,035 to  1,234 mg/m 2 v DOX ,  456 to 600 mg/m2) .
Although these results could have been affected by the greater  incidence of cardiac irradiation inpatients treated with DOX ,  only three patients  who had received such radiotherapy actually developed CHF ,  one on the EPI arm  and two on the DOX arm .
In the present study ,  each drug was given every three weeks in doses  that produced equivalent degrees of myelosuppression ,  a preplanned  limitation on the total cumulative dose of EPI was not used .
Since the present study did not use a fixed limitation for dose of EPI ,  patients who did not have progression of tumor were treated to the  point of laboratory cardiotoxicity or clinical CHF ,  therefore ,  this study  provides cumulative cardiotoxicity data that are not available in the other two studies .
In the present study ,  EPI was found to be significantly less  cardiotoxic than DOX ,  even when the dose is normalized to full myelosuppressive equivalence .
At cumulative EPI doses of 600 to 700 mg/m2 ,  two (13%) of the 15  evaluable patients at risk for RNCA changes developed a decrease in LVEF of >  10% .
In contrast ,  the present study predicts an incidence of laboratory cardiotoxicity in excess of 70% for those patients who receive more  than 600 mg/m2 of DOX .
Thus ,  while assessment of LVEF by RNCA was useful in quantitating  changes in cardiacfunction for the purposes of this study ,  it cannot be  recommended for routine monitoring of individual patients as a predictor of impending cardiac failure .
Our results show that EPI has therapeutic activity that is similar to  that of DOX in patients with advanced breast cancer ,  and that EPI is a less cardiotoxic drug than DOX ,  even accounting for the difference in myelosuppressive potency .
In this study ,  worsening cardiac function forced the premature discontinuation of DOX therapy in three patients experiencing partial responses ,  whereas effective treatment with EPI was never discontinued because of cardiac toxicity .
