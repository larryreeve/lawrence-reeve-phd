There has been no significant difference in disease-free survival between the two treatment groups (Fig 2); 10 patients in the chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation therapy arm have experienced recurrences compared to 9 recurrences in the group of patients treated with chemotherapy alone .
Toxicity was tolerable in the two treatment arms .
The trial was closed to patient entry in June 1994 due to less than optimal accrual .
The null hypothesis considered that the two treatment arms ,  chemotherapyalone and chemotherapy plus radiation , would both  result in 5-year disease-free survival of 70% .
The alternative hypothesis considered that chemotherapy alone would result in a 5-year disease-free survival of 20% less or 50% (significance  level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80) .
Patients with clinical Stage IB-IIA cancer of the uterine cervix treated by radical hysterectomy  , bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy  , and aortic  lymphnode sampling were eligible for entry into this prospective  study if they had one or more of the following risk factors  , (1) metastatic  disease to pelvic lymph nodes  , (2) large primary tumors greater than or equal  to 4 cm in diameter  , (3) deeply invasive lesions with 75% or greater stromal invasion  , (4) nonsquamous histology  , and/or (5) occult parametrial involvement or positive surgical margins .
The analysis of the data from the 89 patients entered is not able to document that the two treatments are equivalent , but must be taken to suggest that the likelihood of finding a significant difference  betweenthese two treatment modalities in a full trial of 160 patients is small .
The investigators hope that future cooperative group trials will consider a chemotherapy-only treatment arm in any studies addressing the role of adjuvant therapy after radical hysterectomy for patients at high  risk for recurrence .
