At present , there is no evidence to support the use of upfront CT before pelvic irradiation in stage III B cervical cancer .
To test this  hypothesis , we began in 1984 at the Instituto Nacional de Cancer (Rio de Janeiro , Brazil) a prospective randomized trial comparing neoadjuvant BOMP CT followed by pelvic RT (CT + RT) versus pelvic RT alone in patients with stage IIIB carcinoma of  the cervix .
The use of upfront CT as initial treatment before pelvic RT would be theoretically advantageous as the vascular supply to the tumor is not compromised , allowing a higher local tissue concentration of drugs , thereby improving the effectiveness of CT .
The high toxicity rate of BOMP CT , in the  dose and schedule used in this study , makes this combination unacceptable for routine use .
While surgery and radiotherapy (RT) are equally effective in early-stage disease , radiation therapy has been the primary treatment modality for stage III disease , with 5-year survival rates between 30% to 45% being reported .
Acute toxicity was pronounced in the combined treatment arm (Table 6) .
The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging criteria were used in this study .
A CR was defined as the complete resolution of all  measurable disease and symptoms , a partial response (PR) was defined as a 50% or more decrease in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of measurable disease , and stable disease (SD) was defined as less than a 50% decrease in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of the measurable lesions .
Disease status was evaluated by pelvic examination and by appropriate radiologic and laboratory investigations .
Patients were randomly allocated to the two treatment arms by drawing cards in sealed envelopes .
Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and was measured from day 1 of therapy until last follow-up or death .
Median survivals were 25 months in the RT arm and 10.5 months in the CT + RT .
The 5-year survival rates for the complete responders were 57% and 36% for the RT and CT + RT groups , respectively .
Between April 1984 and August 1986 , 107 previously untreated patients with stage III B carcinoma of the cervix were entered on the study .
Of greater concern was the bleomycin-related pulmonary toxicity .
Five patients (13%) developed such a complication, and four died as a direct result .
This study was designed with the objective of answering the question of whether neoadjuvant BOMP chemotherapy is effective in stage III B carcinoma of the cervix .
