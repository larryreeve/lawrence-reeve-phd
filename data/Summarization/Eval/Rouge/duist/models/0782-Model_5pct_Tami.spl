Adjuvant chemotherapy reduced the risk of recurrence by 21 % and  the risk of death by 26% .
This effect was observed in all subgroups , but was greatest in  patients with tumour-involved lymph nodes (33%) and in those with colon cancer  (22%) .
After median follow-up of 8 years we were not able to confirm the overall reduction of liver metastases reported by Taylor et al. We  did find , however , a consistent reduction of all kinds of tumour recurrences  that resulted in a significant advantage in overall survival and  disease-free survival for patients treated with adjuvant portal infusion , confirming previous findings .
Adjuvant portal chemotherapy was tolerated without an increase in complications compared with untreated patients .
Based on previous results and our own findings , the Swiss Group  for Clinical Cancer Research decided to accept perioperative adjuvant  chemotherapy as the standard treatment for further clinical trials in colorectal cancer .
