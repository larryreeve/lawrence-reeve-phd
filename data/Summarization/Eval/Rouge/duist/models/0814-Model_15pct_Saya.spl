Despite the short duration of the trial , these preliminary findings confirm the validity of the rationale with lower morbidity for radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy .
The aim of this trial is to assess the effectiveness and toxicity of adjuvant post-operative RT vs. combined RT and CT(5-FU plus levamisole) in patients with TNM stage II-III resectable rectal cancer (pT3-4 , pN0 , M0 , pTl-4 , pNl-3 ,M0) .
The primary endpoint is overall survival , secondary end points are disease-free survival , rate of loco-regional recurrence , and treatment-related toxicity/morbidity .
Eligible patients are enrolled within 40 days after surgery in a multicentre randomized clinical trial with two arms , Arm I = post-operative RT , Arm II = post-operative RT and CT (5-FU plus levamisole) , with stratification by participating institutions .
As regards toxicity , radiodermatitis (8.3% , Grade III) and diarrhoea (8.3% , Grade III) were observed in Arm I while radiodermatitis (13.6% , Grade III) , diarrhoea (27.3% , Grade III , 9.1% , Grade IV) , and leukopaenia (8.3% , GradeIII) occurred in Arm II .
