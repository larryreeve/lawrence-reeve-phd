The number of patients is too few to recommend that concurrent infusional 5-FU with pelvic irradiation should become the standard therapy for these patients .
From the subset analysis of this trial we have generated the hypothesis that there may be a beneficial effect of adding concurrent infusional 5-FU to standard in patients with the disease characteristics of stratum 1 .
Since the data are not conclusive because of limited numbers , confirmation of the beneficial effects observed in this study is necessary .
Interest in infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with or without other agents such as mitomycin C and cisplatin , developed from both laboratory data suggesting enhanced tumor cell kill over radiation alone and clinical data .
In vitro data suggested that the addition of infusional 5-FU to radiation therapy would enhance the radiation effect .
Between May of 1987 and August of 1995 , 234 patients predominantly from two centers , with others participating , were stratified by their extent of pelvic disease and randomized to receive one of four possible treatments .
Stratification was based on a retrospective analyses which defined subgroups with different prognoses based on a combination of FIGO stage and pelvic disease volume .
Patients were randomized to receive either (a) standard external beam pelvic irradiation (EBRT) in a dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions defined at 100% versus , (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional intravenous 5-FU in a dose of 1 g/m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of RT , (c) partially hyperfractionated RT , 5280 cGy in 33 fractions , 2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of RT , or (d) arm (c) with the same infusional 5-FU .
The outcomes of interest in this study were pelvic control , survival , and disease-free survival , as well as the serious late complication rate .
The ''Lifetest Procedure'' in SAS UNIX was used to compare survival curves .
This procedure uses the Kaplan-Meier method that calculates the ranked test pooled across the strata adjusting for strata differences .
