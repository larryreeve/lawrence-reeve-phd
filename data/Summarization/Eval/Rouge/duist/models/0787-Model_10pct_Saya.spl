In line with the earlier trials we found no increased frequency of early or late complications in the patients who received radiotherapy .
In an attempt to increase the rate of curative resection and hence survival , several trials have investigated the role of preoperative radiotherapy in treatment of rectal cancer .
In 1981 , the MRC began this trial of a higher dose of preoperative radiotherapy in patients with fixed or partially fixed tumours of the rectum who were thought to be suitable for abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection .
The effects of radiotherapy on recurrence of cancer and survival are similar to the estimates on which the trial design was based .
There were significant reductions in tumour size and grade and in the rates of local recurrence and distant metastases in the radiotherapy group .
There was a suggestion that the risk of death from colorectal cancer was reduced , and a trend towards an improvement in overall survival .
However , the trial was of sufficient size to detect only substantial improvement in overall survival .
There was no evidence of an excess of complications in the radiotherapy group . Median follow-up time for the patients who survived is 10 years .
The first UK Medical Research Council (MRC) trial of preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer was a three-arm randomised trial with 824 patients comparing a control (surgery alone) group with a group treated with 20 Gy given in 10 equal fractions and another treated with a single exposure of 5 Gy .
Despite the suggestion of a real biological effect of the radiotherapy in the first MRC trial , with significant changes in tumour stage , no advantage was found for either radiotherapy group over the control group in terms of disease recurrence or survival .
However , the trial did demonstrate the importance of fixity as a prognostic factor . 80% of mobile tumours had apparently curative resections compared with 50% of partially fixed , and 30% of fixed tumours .
Eligible patients were men or women younger than 80 years who , had histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum partially or totally fixed within the pelvis with the lower margin of the tumour within 15 cm of the anal verge , were deemed suitable and fit for the proposed treatment and available for regular follow-up , were free of disseminated disease (confirmed by clinical and radiological examination) , and had had no previous malignant disease .
