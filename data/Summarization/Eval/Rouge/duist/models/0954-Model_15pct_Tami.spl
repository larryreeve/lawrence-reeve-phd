This study of premenopausal women with breast cancer demonstrates that locoregional radiotherapy reduces the rates of locoregional and  systemicrelapses and the chance of dying from breast cancer .
These data based on a 15-year follow-up indicate that radiation  can offer substantialprotection from systemic relapse to node-positive patients .
Our data suggest that locoregional disease is not only a marker of  systemicdisease but also , in some patients , a potential source for  its future dissemination .
Because all our patients were uniformly treated with chest-wall and nodal radiation , our results may not apply to patients treated with breast irradiation alone after conservative surgery .
Therefore , it may be necessary to add nodal radiation to breast irradiationin premenopausal node-positive patients who are treated  with partial mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy .
There was an overall reduction of 34 percent in the rate of systemic recurrence (relative risk , 0.66 , 95 percent confidence interval ,  0.49 to 0.89 , P > 0.006) in the group treated with combined therapy (75 of 164 patients vs. 94 of 154 patients in the group treated only with chemotherapy) , and a 17-percentage-point improvement in systemic disease-free survival (Fig. 2) .
The rate of locoregional recurrence was reduced by 56 percent  (relativerisk , 0.44 , 95 percent confidence interval , 0.26 to 0.77 ,  P > 0.003) in the group given chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (19 events , vs. 36  events in the group treated with chemotherapy only) , for an absolute improvement  of 20 percent in survival free of local disease .
Mortality from breast cancer was reduced by 29 percent in the chemotherapy-radiotherapy group (relative risk , 0.71 , 95 percent  confidenceinterval ,0.51 to 0.99 , P > 0.05) , with 62 deaths , as  compared with 76 in the chemotherapy-only group , which represented an improvement of 10 percentage points in breast-cancer-specific survival (Fig. 3) .
The reduction in the relative risk of a recurrence that was obtained by adding radiation to chemotherapy was similar in the subgroup with  one to three positive nodes and the subgroup with four or more positive nodes (Table 3) .
There were no statistically significant differences between these  subgroupswith regard to either survival free of systemic disease  (P for interaction 0.9) or rates of locoregional recurrence (P > 0.73) .
From 1979 through 1986 , 318 premenopausal women with newly diagnosed stage I or II breast cancer were enrolled in the study after undergoing  modifiedradical mastectomy if , after axillary-node dissection , one  or more level I or II lymph nodes were found to be positive on pathological  examination .
All the patients underwent modified radical mastectomy , with dissection of level I and II axillary lymph nodes .
The chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (600 mg per square meter of body-surface area) , methotrexate (40 mg per square meter) , and  fluorouracil(600 mg per square meter) (the CMF regimen) , given  intravenously every 21 days as described by Bonadonna et al. , initially for 12 months (80 patients) , and in the case of patients randomized after 1981 , for  6 months .
The radiation therapy was administered between the fourth and  fifth cycles of chemotherapy .
A total of 318 patients were randomized , and among the survivors the median follow-up was 150 months (150 months in the chemotherapy group and  150 in the chemotherapy-radiotherapy group) .
