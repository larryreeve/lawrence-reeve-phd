This study showed that treatment with irinotecan and supportive care alone , compared with supportive care , prolonged the life of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer .
The trial we report was started in 1995 to compare irinotecan with supportive care alone for survival , quality  of life , and other clinical variables .
These data were supported by the quality-of-life analysis which suggested that the side-effects of irinotecan were favourably  balanced by reduced tumour-related events .
Furthermore , irinotecan improved the symptoms of patients and delayed the onset of tumour-related symptoms such as performance-status deterioration , weight loss , and pain .
This benefit was clinically meaningful because the probability of surviving 1 year was 2.6 times greater in patients given irinotecan compared with that of patients given supportive care alone .
Other efficacy endpoints , such as survival without weight loss , survival without performance status deterioration , pain-free survival , and quality-of-life , were all significantly in favour of irinotecan .
Overall survival was the primary endpoint .
If all criteria were fulfilled , the randomisation was done electronically in the ratio of irinotecan to supportive care , with stratification by centre .
Patients with the following criteria were not eligible , previous treatment with topoisomerase I inhibitors , bulky disease (involving more than 50% of the liver volume or 25% of the lung volume , or abdominal mass >=10 cm) , metastases in the central nervous system , or unresolved bowel obstruction or diarrhoea .
In the supportive-care alone group , patients were given best supportive care and were seen every 3 weeks .
Supportive care was defined as the best care available as judged by the attending physician , according to institutional standards for each centre .
Quality of life was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire (including five function scales , one global health-status scale , and nine symptom scales) , which was filled in at  baseline , at 3 weeks , 6 weeks , and then every 6 weeks .
In first-line chemotherapy , fluorouracil with folinic-acid is  better than supportive care (or delayed chemotherapy) for survival and quality of life , but the value of second-line chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer has  not yet been proven .
Irinotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor that blocks the DNA replication step of the enzyme , leading to multiple single-strand DNA breaks , which eventually blocks cell division .
Survival curves were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method on the randomised population and compared by a two-tailed logrank test .
Patients on supportive-care alone experienced a high incidence of severe adverse events , especially pain and asthenia , although significantly more patients in the irinotecan group experienced severe events , especially neutropenia , nausea , vomiting , and diarrhoea .
Median follow-up was 12.9 months . Patients in the irinotecan group lived significantly longer than those in the supportive-care  group (p=0.0001) .
The association of prognostic factors with survival was estimated  with Cox's proportional hazards model for censored survival  data .
This benefit appeared after 2 months and became more apparent throughout the study period .
1-year survival was 36.2% and 13.8% in the irinotecan and supportive-care groups , respectively .
Compliance decreased more rapidly in the supportive-care group , probably due to earlier deterioration in the  patients .
