In our study , 5-year actuarial survival was the same in the surgery and radiation groups (83%) , which suggests that there is no treatment of choice with respect to local control of disease .
We conducted a prospective , randomised study to compare external and internal radiotherapy with radical hysterectomy and node dissection .
Our main aim was to evaluate 5-year survival and the rate and pattern of complications and recurrences associated with each procedure .
Apart from survival , optimum treatment strategies depend on the benefits and disadvantages of each treatment and on prognostic factors (cervical diameter , histotype , and lymph-node status) .
Radical hysterectomy allows the gonadal function of at least one ovary to be saved , thereby avoiding the effects of early menopause in younger women .
By contrast , radiotherapy is easier to deliver for patients who are obese , are elderly , or have severe illness-major contraindications to the surgical approach .
Surgery also offers other advantages , pelvic relapses can be successfully cured by radiotherapy , whereas salvage surgery after primary irradiation carries a high rate of failures and severe morbidity .
Furthermore , surgery allows the status of the lymph nodes , the most dependent variable associated with survival , to be assessed accurately .
