This study of premenopausal women with breast cancer demonstrates that locoregional radiotherapy reduces the rates of locoregional and  systemicrelapses and the chance of dying from breast cancer .
These data based on a 15-year follow-up indicate that radiation  can offer substantialprotection from systemic relapse to node-positive patients .
Our data suggest that locoregional disease is not only a marker of  systemicdisease but also , in some patients , a potential source for  its future dissemination .
Because all our patients were uniformly treated with chest-wall and nodal radiation , our results may not apply to patients treated with breast irradiation alone after conservative surgery .
Therefore , it may be necessary to add nodal radiation to breast irradiationin premenopausal node-positive patients who are treated  with partial mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy .
