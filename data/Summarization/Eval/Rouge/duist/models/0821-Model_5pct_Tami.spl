Our results and those of Browman et al do not support reports of  superiorefficacy for the sequential administration of MTX followed  by 5-FU compared to other drug sequences .
Sequential administration of moderate doses of MTX followed by 5-FU has been reported effective in advanced head and neck cancer and colorectal  cancer , as well as breast cancer , but the importance of the  sequence remains uncertain .
We therefore conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial in  which sequential MTX followed by 5-FU was compared to the same  drugs given in the opposite order .
No significant sequence-dependent differences in response rate or survival duration were observed among the patients with colorectal  cancer .
Both treatment sequences were effective in head and neck cancer ,  producing an overall major response rate (complete and partial) of  46% of all entered patients , including 52% (95% confidence limits , 39%-65%) of evaluable patients .
