In line with the earlier trials we found no increased frequency of early or late complications in the patients who received radiotherapy .
In an attempt to increase the rate of curative resection and hence survival , several trials have investigated the role of preoperative radiotherapy in treatment of rectal cancer .
In 1981 , the MRC began this trial of a higher dose of preoperative radiotherapy in patients with fixed or partially fixed tumours of the rectum who were thought to be suitable for abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection .
The effects of radiotherapy on recurrence of cancer and survival are similar to the estimates on which the trial design was based .
There were significant reductions in tumour size and grade and in the rates of local recurrence and distant metastases in the radiotherapy group .
There was a suggestion that the risk of death from colorectal cancer was reduced , and a trend towards an improvement in overall survival .
