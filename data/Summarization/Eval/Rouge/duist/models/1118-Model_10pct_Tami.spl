In conclusion , when comparing patients with concurrent therapy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to radiotherapy alone , our study showed that concurrent multiagent chemoradiotherapy did not prove to be a superior definitive therapy for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
Our results demonstrated that multiagent chemoradiotherapy , concurrently administrated with radiation to improve tumor response , can also produce serious acute and late toxicities , and life-threatening complications .
Our results indicated that , despite the excellent early tumor response seen during treatment , the benefit of concurrent chemoradiation in terms of reduced mortality and increased pelvic control rates may not be as great as that suggested by other reports .
Our study also revealed that the patterns of recurrences were not changed by the concomitant therapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
Thus  , we designed the randomized trial to compare the tumor response and survival rate of patients with advanced cervical carcinoma receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus patients receiving radiotherapy alone .
The purpose of this randomized trial was to assess whether the chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone for locally advanced cervical carcinoma .
We also compared the toxicity of the two compared groups after planned treatment .
After a median follow-up of 46.8 months , the disease-free survival and actuarial survival rates at 3 years for patients in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group were not statistically different compared with patients in the radiotherapy group (51.7% versus 53.2% , P Å 0.92 , and 61.7% versus 64.5% , P Å 0.88 , respectively) .
Survival Of the chemoradiotherapy group , 31 patients (51.7%) are alive without evidence of disease , 6 (10%) remain alive with disease , and 21 (35%) died of disease at 7 - 48 months .
Of the radiation group , 33 patients (53.2%) are alive without evidence of disease , 7 (11.3%) remain alive with disease , and 22 (35.5%) died of disease at 12 - 45 months .
An analysis of the patterns of failure reveals that the incidence of pelvic failure was equally distributed between the treatment groups (31.7% versus 30.6% , P Å 0.93) .
Additionally , there was also no difference in the incidence of distant failure between the chemoradiotherapy group and the radiotherapy group (21.6% versus 29% , P Å 0.47) .
The tumor response was significantly higher in patients receiving concurrent chemoradia tion than in pa tients who rece ived radiatio n alone (P = 0.04) .
The acute treatment-related toxicity (grade 3 or 4) appears to be higher with the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group when compared with radiation group (36.7% versus 17.7% , P Å 0.02) .
Although there was no significant difference between the two compared groups with regard to treatment-related late toxicity (concurrent group 23.3% versus radiation group 12.9% , P = 0.13) ,a nonsignificant trend toward a higher rate of late toxicity in the chemoradiotherapy group is evident .
The incidence of delayed treatment was significantly higher in patients with concurrent chemoradiotherapy than those patients with radiation alone (15.0% versus 3.2% , P Å 0.02) .
