The results do not support reports based on uncontrolled studies that sequential administration of MTX before 5-FU is important to the efficacy of this combination
We therefore conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial in which sequential MTX followed by 5-FU was compared to the same drugs given in the opposite order .
The sequential exposure of L1210 cells to MTX and then to 5-FU was shown to increase the intracellular concentration of 5-FU ribonucleotides , a potential mechanism of synergy .
However , synergy is not observed in the presence of physiologic concentrations of purines , raising doubts about its clinical relevance .
Survival duration was not significantly different by treatment sequence in univariate analyses , though the trend favored the sequence of 5-FU before MTX , in which the median survival had not been reached at 23 months , compared to a median survival of 13.3 months in the group receiving MTX before 5-FU .
Our results and those of Browman et al do not support reports of superior efficacy for the sequential administration of MTX followed by 5-FU compared to other drug sequences .
Patients eligible for this study had measurable or evaluable advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck , adenocarcinoma of the colon , rectum or stomach , or SCC of other primary site (Table I) .
In either case , the dose of MTX was 250 mg/m2 , and the dose of 5-FU was 600 mg/m2 .
In fact , no significant difference was observed between the toxicities of the two drug sequences (Table 2) , suggesting that neither synergy nor antagonism was displayed in the effects of either sequence on normal tissues .
Statistical analysis used BMDP statistical software to prepare and compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves (program BMDPIL) for the group as a whole and for subgroups by primary site , treatment sequence , performance status , sex , age group , and response to therapy .
Standard WHO definitions of response categories and toxicity grades were followed .
Differences in response rates between treatment sequences were not statistically significant (Table 3) , but there was a consistent trend toward higher response rates in the groups receiving MF .
Antagonism could have provided a therapeutic advantage if it were more marked in normal tissues than in tumor , as higher doses could then have been used in the FM arm .
