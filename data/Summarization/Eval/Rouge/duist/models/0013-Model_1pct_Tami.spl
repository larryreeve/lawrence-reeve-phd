The results of this trial in cervix cancer reflect a common set of  findingsin combination chemotherapy of advanced solid tumors ,  namely , a higher response rate (but not a high CR rate) with a combination compared  with single-agent therapy at the cost of more toxicity and no  survival benefit .
There was no significant difference in survival between cisplatin  and either of the combination regimens (median[months] , cisplatin , 8.0 , C +  M , 7.3 , CIFX , 8.3 , P =.835) (Fig 2) .
