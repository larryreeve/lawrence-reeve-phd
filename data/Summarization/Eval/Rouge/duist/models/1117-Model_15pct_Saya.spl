In our study , 5-year actuarial survival was the same in the surgery and radiation groups (83%) , which suggests that there is no treatment of choice with respect to local control of disease .
We conducted a prospective , randomised study to compare external and internal radiotherapy with radical hysterectomy and node dissection .
Our main aim was to evaluate 5-year survival and the rate and pattern of complications and recurrences associated with each procedure .
Apart from survival , optimum treatment strategies depend on the benefits and disadvantages of each treatment and on prognostic factors (cervical diameter , histotype , and lymph-node status) .
Radical hysterectomy allows the gonadal function of at least one ovary to be saved , thereby avoiding the effects of early menopause in younger women .
By contrast , radiotherapy is easier to deliver for patients who are obese , are elderly , or have severe illness-major contraindications to the surgical approach .
Surgery also offers other advantages , pelvic relapses can be successfully cured by radiotherapy , whereas salvage surgery after primary irradiation carries a high rate of failures and severe morbidity .
Furthermore , surgery allows the status of the lymph nodes , the most dependent variable associated with survival , to be assessed accurately .
Most women with stage Ib-IIa cervical cancer can be treated successfully with radiotherapy , whereas a judicious selection of patients is necessary before planning primary radical surgery .
Women whose cervical diameters are larger than 4 cm should be identified before surgery so that they can benefit from tailored treatment , radical radiotherapy , with the option of concomitant radiosensitising chemotherapy to improve the local control of the disease , or cisplatinbased chemotherapy followed by radical surgery .
The latter approach offers the advantages of surgery , and the neoadjuvant chemotherapy will keep to a minimum the risk of extracervical spread of the tumour without combining surgery and radiotherapy .
Our study was not aimed to assess the usefulness of the postoperative treatment , though our finding that patients treated with surgery plus radiotherapy were exposed to early and late complicationsof both treatments is important .
Between September , 1986 , and December , 1991 , 578 patients with primary invasive cervical cancer were referred to the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Radiation Oncology , at the Istituto di Scienze Biomediche S Gerardo, University of Milan , Monza .
Treatment was assigned by block randomisation (clusters of ten cases of each stratum of cervical diameter) from a computer-generated table that had been created before the start of the study .
We used multivariate Cox regression analysis to assess the effect of cervical size , age , FIGO state , histological type , grade of differentiation , radiological lymph-node status , and treatment group on overall survival .
We used the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) clinical staging system to classify the stage of cancer .
The two groups did not differ significantly as regards squamous histotype , overall 5-year survival rates were 84% in surgery-group patients and 88% in radiotherapy-group patients , overall disease-free survival was 76% and 78% , respectively .
Median follow-up was 87 (range 57-120) months .
5-year actuarial disease-free survival for the surgery and radiotherapy groups was 80% and 82% , respectively , for patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or smaller , and 63% and 57% for those with a diameter larger than 4 cm , the between group differences were not significant .
The patients were randomly assigned radical surgery (n=172) or radical radiotherapy (n=171) .
Overall , 86 (25.5%) patients developed recurrent disease , 42 (25%) in the surgery group and 44 (26%) in the radiotherapy group .
Complications were classified according to the glossary of Chassagne and colleagues.
In the surgery group , 48 (28%) patients showed severe (grade 2-3) morbidity that required medical or surgical treatment , compared with 19 (12%) patients in the radiotherapy group , (p=0.0004, table 3) .
