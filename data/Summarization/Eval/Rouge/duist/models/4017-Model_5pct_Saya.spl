The results we achieved with the irinotecan combination treatment show that the addition of irinotecan to weekly or 2-weekly regimens of fluorouracil and calcium folinate by infusion brings clear clinical benefit and should be considered as a first-line reference treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer as well as for advanced disease .
We did a phase III multicentre randomised trial that was designed to assess whether the addition of irinotecan to fluorouracil and calcium folinate would benefit patients previously untreated with chemotherapy (other than adjuvant) for metastatic colorectal cancer .
Combination of irinotecan with fluorouracil and calcium folinate significantly increased response rates , time to progression , and survival .
Data suggest that the development of well-tolerated regimens that combine irinotecan and high-dose fluorouracil and calcium folinate may be beneficial in the first-line treatment of colorectal cancer .
From May , 1997 , to February , 1998 , we enrolled patients who met the following eligibility criteria , histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum , age 18-75 years , WHO performance status of 2 or less and life expectancy of more than 3 months , haemoglobin 100 g/L or more , absolute neutrophil count 2.0 10/L , platelets 150 10/L or more , creatinine 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal , total bilirubin 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal , aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 3.0 or less times the upper limit of normal (if liver metastases present , 1.5 or less times for bilirubin and 5.0 or less times for aspartate and alanine aminotransferases) , and no previous (other than adjuvant) chemotherapy , finished more than 6 months before randomisation .
We randomly assigned patients irinotecan combined with fluorouracil and calcium folinate (irinotecan group) or fluorouracil and calcium folinate only (no-irinotecan group , figure 1) .
Our primary endpoint was response rate .
We estimated survival curves by the Kaplan-Meier method , and compared the two groups by the log-rank test .
