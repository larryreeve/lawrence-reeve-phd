The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment , but they share a common result , all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin .
We elected to test this combination in a phase 3 trial to determine whether concurrent weekly treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy would improve progression-free survival and survival in women with large "bulky" or barrel-shaped , stage IB cervical cancers .
