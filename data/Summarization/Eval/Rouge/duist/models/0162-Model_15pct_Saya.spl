In conclusion , the 5-yr results of our randomized study confirm that CMF , particularly when delivered at nearly full doses , can indeed alter the postoperative course of breast cancer with positive axillary nodes .
All our progress reports have consistently demonstrated that there was a significant difference in the relapse-free survival (RFS) favoring patients who received adjuvant CMF .
These results , as well as those reported in similar studies , suggest that the multimodality approach with cyclical combination chemotherapy is indeed an important advance in the strategy of primary management of resectable breast cancer , and therefore it is worthy of more widespread consideration .
Among the numerous questions to be answered by current adjuvant studies is the optimal duration of treatment .
For this reason , in September 1975 , we started a new prospective study with the intent to evaluate the possibility of reducing the duration of adjuvant CMF without compromising the therapeutic effect of combined treatment .
SINCE JUNE 1973, the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of CMF (cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , and fluorouracil) chemotherapy were evaluated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes .
The aim of the first program was to evaluate whether CMF given after radical surgery was able to alter the course of the disease .
After radical mastectomy , eligible patients were prospectively randomized to receive either no further treatment or 12 monthly cycles of adjuvant CMF .
The 5-yr results of the present study are now sufficiently mature to indicate with confidence that 6 cycles of CMF are equivalent to 12 cycles in terms of RFS and total survival .
Our data suggest that the main important pharmacologic factor affecting tumor response is the peak level of drugs administered and not their total amount .
Thus , all above reported findings strongly support our preliminary 3-yr results and indicate that utilizing a single multidrug regimen , it is possible to reduce the duration of adjuvant treatment in operable breast cancer without compromising the therapeutic results .
Present results are in line with those reported in a similar study carried out at the Sidney Farber Cancer Institute .
It appears evident that , (A) the two series given 12 cycles of CMF achieved the same results , (B) the data reported in the three series treated with CMF are almost equivalent , (C) adjuvant CMF , whether administered for 12 or 6 cycles , was able to alter the course of operable breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes compared to the group subjected to radical mastectomy alone .
The results obtained in our series between ER + and ER - tumors , coupled with the overall findings observed in the two menopausal groups , further contribute to minimize the possible therapeutic role of chemotherapy-induced adjuvant castration in premenopausal women .
The fact that premenopausal women with ER + showed a significantlylonger survival than their matches with ER - tumors remains to be further evaluated .
Based on our current findings , i.e. , therapeutic efficacy of adjuvant CMF regardless of ER status , there seems to be no clinical reason to withhold the administration of adjuvant combination chemotherapy in node positive women even in the presence of ER + tumors .
Through the analysis of our results in advanced breast cancer treated with CMF , Skipper came to the conclusion that in clinically metastatic disease the nadir in surviving tumor cells is probably reached in the majority of patients in less than 6 cycles .
Our clinical findings from anadjuvant treatment support this conclusion and indicate that the maximum therapeutic effect can be obtained with 6 or probably less than 6 cycles of CMF .
Therefore , there are no sound clinical reasons to prolong treatment utilizing the same drugs beyond a 6-mo period .
This observation is indirectly supported by findings obtained at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center where 24 cycles of CMF were unable to obtain results superior to those achieved in our series .
In fact , in all variables examined , none of the two treatments under evaluation was significantly different from the other .
The observation that in some patient subsets 6 cycles of CMF yielded apparently superior results to 12 cycles is probably related to the relative number of patients in each group and to the different median follow-up in postmenopausal women  whose accrual was discontinued in December 1976 .
Besides RFS and survival , other findings would support evidence that 6 cycles of CMF are as effective as 12 cycles .
Between September 1975 and May 1978 , a total of 466 consecutive patients were entered into a prospective randomized study .
Within 4 wk from surgery , patients with TI-3a breast cancer , histologically positive axillary nodes , age < 70 yr , and living fairly close to the Institute were allocated to receive either 12 or 6 cycles of CMF .
Based on the 3-yr analysis of our first CMF study showing an apparent lack of therapeutic advantage following adjuvant chemotherapy in postmenopausal women , randomization for this group of patients was discontinued at the end of November 1976 .
Therefore , all postmenopausal patients were allocated to receive 12 CMF cycles between December 1976 and March 1977 when accrual for postmenopausal patients was definitely discontinued .
