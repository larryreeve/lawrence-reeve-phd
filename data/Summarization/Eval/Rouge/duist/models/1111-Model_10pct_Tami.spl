Thus , adjunctive radiotherapy is beneficial for Stage I cervical cancer patients with clinical–pathological risk factors for recurrence other than positive nodes .
This conclusion is based on a significant reduction of cancer recurrences in patients in our study and acceptably low morbidity with a single treatment-related fatality .
The present prospective randomized study showed that adjunctive radiotherapy significantly reduced the number of cancer recurrences in women with the above risk factors by 44% and that the difference in recurrences between irradiated and nonirradiated patients was statistically significant at the P 5 0.019 level .
A detailed GOG clinical pathologic study had established that certain patients with poor prognostic factors related to the primary tumor (i.e. , large tumor size , deep stromal invasion , and capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement) but without lymph node involvement had a risk of recurrence of 31% after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy .
In 1988 the GOG initiated a prospective randomized study (GOG #92)  , reported here  , to investigate the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy for Stage I cervical cancer patients treated by conventional radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who were at high risk for recurrence  , because of LTD  , DSI  , CLS  , but excluding patients with lymph node metastases .
Between March 1988 and September 1995  , 299 women were accessioned into the study .
The crude estimate in the reduction in risk in patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy was 47% (i.e.  , relative risk 5 0.53) with the recurrence-free rate of 88% in the radiotherapy group and 79% in the no-further-therapy group at 2 years (Fig. 1) .
Fortyfive (78%) of 58 recurrences were local only (vagina or pelvis)  (Table 4) .
The Cox model analysis indicated that when adjusting for all combinations of the three risk factors—tumor size  , CLS , and the depth of invasion—the risk of recurrence was significantly reduced by 44% in the radiation group (P 5 0.019 , one-tail) .
The relative mortality rate is estimated at 0.64 which indicates 36% less mortality in the radiation group , a significance level is not provided because the survival data are not mature .
The GOG #92 multicenter prospective randomized study was designed to determine whether postoperative pelvic radiotherapy following radical hysterectomy and pelvic node dissection would reduce the rate of recurrence and decrease the mortality in Stage IB cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter  , deep stromal invasion by tumor  , and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces found on microscopic examination .
Patients received external beam irradiation and no brachytherapy .
The primary outcome variable was recurrence-free interval (RFI) .
Nevertheless , we found tumor diameter to be the most significant risk factors in the Cox model analysis of our study results , confirming multiple data sets which demonstrate that the size of the primary cancer is critical for local control despite the imprecision of measurement .
Interestingly , our prospective study did provide conclusive evidence of pelvic radiotherapy being effective in women with primary tumor-related risk factors but negative nodes .
