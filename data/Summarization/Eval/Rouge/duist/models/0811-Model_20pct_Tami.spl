The purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate ,  by such a randomized and controlled comparison ,  a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5-FU activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials .
We chose for our evaluation the combinations of 5- FU with thymidine ,  with N-(phosphonacetyl)-Laspartic acid (PALA) ,  with levamisole ,  and with methyl CCNU ,  vincristine ,  and streptozotocin (MOF-Strept) .
Thymidine given at high doses in animal model systems has been shown to increase both therapeutic activity and toxicity of 5-FU and to improve the therapeutic index of this agent .
PALA is a potent inhibitor of aspartate transcarbamylase and has a broad spectrum of activity in animal model tumor screens .
Levamisole is an agent that has been used extensively to treat parasitic infections in man and domestic animals .
It has also been shown to have immunomodulatory effects .
In 1981 ,  a New York Memorial study reported a 32% objective response rate among 77 patients treated with MOF-Strept .
With this background we initiated a randomized controlled comparison of 5-FU alone with 5-FU plus high-dose thymidine ,  5-FU plus PALA ,  5-FU plus levamisole ,  and MOF-Strept .
We elected to use survival as our primary endpoint in patients with both measurable and nonmeasurable disease and also to evaluate objective response rates among those patients with measurable disease .
All patients were required to have histologic or cytologic confirmation of unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer .
Patients were then randomized to treatment with 5-FU alone ,  5-FU plus PALA .
5-FU plus thymidine .
5-FU plus levamisole ,  or MOFStrept .
The primary endpoint of our overall study was patient survival .
A secondary objective was to assess objective response rates among those patients who had measurable disease .
Standard criteria for declaring objective response were used .
ie .
a 5017 or greater reduction in the product of longest perpendicular diameters of bidimensionally measurable lesions or a 30% or greater decrease in the sum of liver measurements below the xyphoid process at costal margin .
A total of 347 patients were randomized on this study .
It is noteworthy that most of these patients were in excellent general condition .
MOF-Strept was characterized by substantially more frequent and more severe nausea and vomiting ,  and this was the only regimen characterized by a substantive incidence of thrombocytopenia .
5-FU plus PALA had substantially more frequent mucocutaneous reactions and somewhat more frequent diarrhea ,  but less hematologic toxicity than 5-FU alone or any of the other regimens .
On the other hand ,  5-FU plus thymidine had a reduced incidence of mucocutaneous reactions and of diarrhea with comparable hematologic toxicity when compared with 5-FU alone .
The addition of levamisole to 5-FU had no discernable impact upon toxicity except for a slight increase in leukopenia .
There were three treatment-related deaths ,  one each on 5-FU alone ,  5-FU plus thymidine ,  and MOF-Strept .
None of the combination regimens showed a significant advantage to 5-FU used alone .
It is noteworthy that while the MOF-Strept regimen had the highest regression rate ,  it was also the regimen with the lowest proportion of patients whose disease remained stable and the highest proportion of patients in whom the best response observed was tumor regression .
Whereas 5-FU plus PALA was associated with the lowest regression rate ,  these regressions were of the longest median duration .
The median interval to progression for all patients was 3/V2 months .
There was no suggestion that any of the combination regimens performed in a superior fashion to 5-FU used alone ,  and it is unlikely that any could produce as much as a 50% increase in time to progression (P < .05) for each regimen v 5-FU alone .
The median survival for all patients was 81/4 months .
None of the combination regimens showed a significant superiority to 5-FU used alone .
In spite of the fact that the patients tested were in very good overall general condition with no previous chemotherapy exposure ,  none of our experimental regimens produced any meaningful advantage over therapy with simple 5-FU alone and none can be recommended for standard practice .
In each of the regimens we tested ,  drug dosages and scheduling were admittedly largely arbitrary .
It is entirely possible that different proportionate representation of drug dosages or different scheduling could produce more favorable or less favorable results than we observed .
An interesting sidelight of this study is the fact that grade of tumor anaplasia was found to be a powerful prognostic determinant ,  matching the more well-established performance status and presence or absence of measurable disease .
