In this study , EPI had therapeutic activity in breast cancer similar to DOX , but produced less cardiotoxicity than the parent compound .
In the present trial , EPI was compared with its parent compound in terms of both toxicity and antitumor efficacy .
The observed major therapeutic response rate to EPI (25%) was identical to that observed with DOX (25%) .
In the present study , each drug was given every three weeks in doses that produced equivalent degrees of myelosuppression , a preplanned limitation on the total cumulative dose of EPI was not used .
In the present study , EPI was found to be significantly less cardiotoxic than DOX , even when the dose is normalized to full myelosuppressive equivalence .
In contrast , the present study predicts an incidence of laboratory cardiotoxicity in excess of 70% for those patients who receive more than 600 mg/m2 of DOX .
Our results show that EPI has therapeutic activity that is similar to that of DOX in patients with advanced breast cancer , and that EPI is a less cardiotoxic drug than DOX , even accounting for the difference in myelosuppressive potency .
A combination of RNCA and endomyocardial biopsy is recommended for the individual patient at high risk for whom a therapeutic decision must be made .
Thus , while assessment of LVEF by RNCA was useful in quantitating changes in cardiacfunction for the purposes of this study , it cannot be recommended for routine monitoring of individual patients as a predictor of impending cardiac failure .
These findings , which are supported by the independent work of several other investigators , provide encouragement for further clinical trials with EPI .
Six (25%) of the 24 evaluable patients treated with EPI and seven (25%) of the 28 evaluable patients on the DOX arm achieved PRs .
The median duration of PR for patients responding to EPI was 11.9 months , whereas median duration of PR on the DOX arm was 7.1 months .
Although the major response rates did not differ between the two arms (chisquare test , P = .98) , the difference in duration of response is of borderline significance (logrank test , P = .11) .
The median actual dose administered was 100% of the projected dose of EPI and 86% of the planned dose of DOX (Wilcoxon test , P = .01) .
Hematologic toxicity was similar in the two arms (Table 3) .
Each patient had a baseline RNCA scan , and in all patients the resting LVEF was > 50% with the exception of one patient in whom it was 48% .
The median dose to development of cardiotoxicity for all evaluable patients was 935 mg/m2 for EPI and 468 mg/m2 for DOX (Fig 2A) .
The cumulative doses of EPI at which clinical CHF was observed (1,035 , 1,105 , 1,162 , and 1,234 mg/m 2) were approximately twice the cumulative doses of DOX at which CHF was seen (456 , 480 , 492 , 560 , and 600 mg/m2) .
The median WBC nadir was 2.0 x 103/gL (range , 0.1 to 8.6) and the median platelet nadir was 132 x 103//pL (range , 20.0 to 279.0) in patients receiving EPI , the median WBC nadir was 1.8 x 10'/3tL (range , 0.3 to .9) and median platelet nadir was 130 x 103/pL (range 24.0 to 253.0) in patients on the DOX arm .
A total of 54 women were randomized , 25 to the EPI arm and 29 to the DOX arm .
Therefore , for this study laboratory cardiac toxicity was defined as decrease in resting LVEF of > 10% from pretreatment baseline or a decrease in LVEF with stress of > 5% from the resting baseline obtained on the same day .
This study was conducted in patients with advanced breast cancer who had progressed after receiving combination chemotherapy .
Patients were stratified for performance status (Karnofsky scale < 70% v > 80%) and for estrogen receptor status of the primary or a metastatic lesion (positive or unknown v negative) .
All patients were then randomly assigned to receive either EPI or DOX .
The dose of EPI was 85 mg/m2 , and the dose of DOX was 60 mg/m2 .
It was anticipated that these doses would produce equivalent degrees of myelosuppression .
DOXORUBICIN (DOX) , or Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories , Columbus , Ohio) , is one of the most useful antineoplastic agents available .
It possesses a broad spectrum of clinical antitumor efficacy and is the most active nonhormonal drug for the treatment of breast cancer .
Its use , however , is limited by cumulative , dose-dependent , chronic cardiotoxicity .
In retrospective studies , the incidence of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) was estimated to be approximately 3% to 4% after a cumulative DOX dose of 450 mg/m2 and 6% to 10% after 550 mg/m2 , the incidence of CHF rises steeply after higher cumulative doses.On the basis of these retrospective studies , an empiric dose limitation of 450 to 550 mg/m2 has been recommended when DOX is used on a standard every three week schedule .
