The risk of recurrence and death was significantly reduced by concurrent treatment with cisplatinand radiotherapy .
Although this regimen was also associated with higher rates of adverse effects , these effects consisted predominantly of transient hematologic and gastrointestinal effects , with no evidence of an increase in other serious effects .
Therefore , radiotherapy in combination with treatment with cisplatin should be adequate for patients with bulky stage IB cervical cancer .
The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment , but they share a common result , all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin .
This remarkable consistency offers a compelling reason to consider cisplatin therapy in combination with radiotherapy as a new standard of care for patients with bulky stage IB , stage IIB through IVA , and high-risk cervical cancers .
Women of any age with biopsy-proved primary squamous-cell carcinoma , adenocarcinoma , or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix of stage IB (exophytic or expansile barrel-shaped tumors with a minimal diameter of 4 cm) were eligible for the study .
All patients were scheduled to undergo external irradiation , intracavitary brachytherapy , and extrafascial hysterectomy , with half the patients randomly assigned to receive weekly intravenous infusions of cisplatin during the period of radiotherapy .
Cisplatin was given intravenously once a week at a dose of 40 mg per square meter of body-surface area , with the total dose not to exceed 70 mg per week .
Extrafascial hysterectomy was performed three to six weeks after the completion of radiotherapy .
The relative risk of recurrence in the combined-therapy group as compared with the group given radiotherapy alone was 0.51 (95 percent confidence interval , 0.34 to 0.75) .
The threeyear survival rates were 74 percent in the group given radiotherapy alone and 83 percent in the combined-therapy group (P=0.008 by the log-rank test) (Fig. 2) .
The relative risk of death in the combined-therapy group as compared with the group given radiotherapy alone was 0.54 (95 percent confidence interval , 0.34 to 0.86) .
At the time of this analysis , the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher among patients in the combined-therapy group (P<0.001 by the log-rank test) (Fig. 1) .
Forty-nine of the patients in the group given radiotherapy alone died of cervical cancer (26 percent) , as compared with 27 of the patients in the group given radiotherapy and cisplatin (15 percent) (Table 4) .
