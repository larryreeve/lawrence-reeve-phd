In our study  , 5-year actuarial survival was the same in the surgery and radiation groups (83%)  , which suggests that there is no treatment of choice with respect to local control of disease .
The overall and disease-free actuarial 5-year survival for all patients were 83% and 74%  , respectively  , and did not differ significantly between the groups (figure 2). 5-year actuarial survival stratified by cervical diameter was similar in the surgery and radiotherapy groups (diameter < 4 cm  , 87% vs 90%  , diameter >4 cm  , 70% vs 72%  , figure 3  , table 3). 5-year actuarial disease-free survival for the surgery and radiotherapy groups was 80% and 82%  , respectively , for patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or smaller , and 63% and 57% for those with a diameter larger than 4 cm , the between group differences were not significant .
