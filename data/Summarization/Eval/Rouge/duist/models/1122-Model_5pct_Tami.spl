There has been no significant difference in disease-free survival between the two treatment groups (Fig 2); 10 patients in the chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation therapy arm have experienced recurrences compared to 9 recurrences in the group of patients treated with chemotherapy alone .
Toxicity was tolerable in the two treatment arms .
The trial was closed to patient entry in June 1994 due to less than optimal accrual .
The null hypothesis considered that the two treatment arms ,  chemotherapyalone and chemotherapy plus radiation , would both  result in 5-year disease-free survival of 70% .
