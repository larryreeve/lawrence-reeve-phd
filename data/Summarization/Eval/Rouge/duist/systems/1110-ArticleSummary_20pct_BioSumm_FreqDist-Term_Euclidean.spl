OF the estimated 13,700 women in the United States in whom invasive cervical cancer was diagnosed in 1998 ,  nearly 5000 will ultimately die of the disease because of the inadequacies of current treatment .
We report the first results of this study .
METHODS .
Patients .
A medical history taking and clinical examination were required before enrollment .
The surveillance committees of the National Cancer Institute and participating institutions approved this trial .
Treatment .
The suggested maximal doses to the bladder ,  the rectum ,  and the lateral surface of the vagina were 75 ,  70 ,  and 130 Gy ,  respectively .
Follow-up .
Quality Control .
Each institution’s equipment was calibrated by employees of the Radiological Physics Center in Houston .
Statistical Analysis .
Death from any cause was considered a failure in the analysis .
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate both survival rates .
Log-rank tests were used to compare treatments .
The Cox proportional-hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios .
To detect such a difference ,  we predicted that we would need to enroll 400 women in the study over a four-year period and then follow them for an additional four years .
We estimated that 199 women would have died by the time of the initial analysis of treatment .
RESULTS .
Characteristics of the Patients .
There were no significant differences in these characteristics between the groups .
Side Effects .
Hematologic effects were generally moderate .
Outcome .
The median duration of follow-up was 43 months .
For these patients ,  overall survival was significantly better if they were treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
DISCUSSION .
The acute side effects were severe ,  possibly because of the addition of chemotherapy or the altered regimen of fractionation .
Future studies are needed to define the optimal regimen for these agents and to evaluate other combinations .
