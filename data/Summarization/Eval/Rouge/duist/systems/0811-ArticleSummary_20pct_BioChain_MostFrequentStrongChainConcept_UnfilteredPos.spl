ADVANCED colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common oncologic challenges encountered in the Western world .
Nevertheless ,  there is little evidence of effective therapy for such patients other than symptomatic and supportive care. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is considered by many as the standard of chemotherapy ,  but in larger experiences with this agent ,  response rates have only been in the 15% to 20% range .
A hope frequently pursued in clinical research has been that the activity of 5-FU can be enhanced either by adding the activity of other cytotoxic drugs or ,  more recently ,  by favorably modulating the effects of 5-FU itself .
The purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate ,  by such a randomized and controlled comparison ,  a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5-FU activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials .
Thymidine given at high doses in animal model systems has been shown to increase both therapeutic activity and toxicity of 5-FU and to improve the therapeutic index of this agent .
These effects presumably occur through the action of thymidine in blocking oxidative metabolism of 5-FU and increasing 5-FU incorporation into RNA .
Pilot and phase 2 trials of this combination in humans showed the dose-limiting toxicity to be mucocutaneous effects .
In the phase 2 trial of Bedikian et al ,  a relatively discouraging 14% response rate was recorded among 50 patients ,  but an additional 54% were stated to have achieved "disease stabilization." .
It has also been shown to have immunomodulatory effects .
The first was a small surgical adjuvant study reported by Verhaegen et al in which levamisole-treated patients had a significantly improved survival when compared with untreated controls .
If this result could be confirmed it would be the first time that any regimen has demonstrated such significant survival improvement for advanced colorectal cancer in randomized trials .
In 1981 ,  a New York Memorial study reported a 32% objective response rate among 77 patients treated with MOF-Strept .
In a randomized trial ,  this group showed that this combination produced superior response rates and survival when compared with their own variant of the 5-FU ,  methyl CCNU ,  vincristine combination .
In contrast ,  however ,  the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group reported only a 4% response rate among 41 patients treated with MOF-Strept and they discouraged further use of this combination .
Again it would seem appropriate that the activity and toxicity of the MOF-Strept combination be placed in perspective by a randomized comparison with 5-FU alone .
We elected to use survival as our primary endpoint in patients with both measurable and nonmeasurable disease and also to evaluate objective response rates among those patients with measurable disease .
If severe toxicity had been obtained with a previous treatment course ,  drug dosages were appropriately reduced with subsequent therapy .
The primary endpoint of our overall study was patient survival .
A secondary objective was to assess objective response rates among those patients who had measurable disease .
It was required that this result be observed at least 4 weeks after the onset of therapy ,  but there was no requirement for duration of response .
Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method .
RESULTS .
Toxicity .
MOF-Strept was characterized by substantially more frequent and more severe nausea and vomiting ,  and this was the only regimen characterized by a substantive incidence of thrombocytopenia. 5-FU plus PALA had substantially more frequent mucocutaneous reactions and somewhat more frequent diarrhea ,  but less hematologic toxicity than 5-FU alone or any of the other regimens .
The most unique toxicity of this regimen was a substantially increased incidence of neurologic effects .
Objective response rates are shown according to regimen in Table 3 .
Figure 2 displays the patient survival according to treatment regimen .
The median survival for all patients was 81/4 months .
The results of this study were singularly discouraging .
It is entirely possible that different proportionate representation of drug dosages or different scheduling could produce more favorable or less favorable results than we observed .
The dose-limiting mucocutaneous toxicity that we observed undoubtedly represented the additive effects of both agents .
In agreement with the New York Memorial Group ,  and in contrast with the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group results ,  we did record a moderately high response rate with the MOFStrept combination .
