Introduction .
Standard therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer is fluorouracil ,  commonly modulated by calcium folinate ,  which typically yields a median survival time of 10-14 months .
These regimens were selected for first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer ,  based on promising antitumour efficacy and an acceptable safety profile .
Methods .
We obtained written informed consent from each patient before enrolment .
Approval was obtained from the ethics committee of each participating centre .
Study design .
Randomisation was done centrally in the study sponsor's office by a computer-generated random scheme ,  and was stratified by centre .
During the follow-up period ,  we traced any continuing adverse effects related to the study treatment until resolution .
Responses were assessed after each treatment cycle ,  according to WHO criteria .
Tumours were assessed by an external response-review committee ,  which was masked to treatment group .
Statistical analysis .
To accommodate an anticipated 5% loss of patients to follow-up ,  we planned to include at least 151 patients in each group (total 302) .
For continuous variables ,  we used Student's t tests .
We based the selection of models of prognostic factors on a forward stepwise procedure ,  with the treatment being forced in the model .
To enter and remove terms in the model we used p=0.08 and p=0.10 ,  respectively .
Results .
Baseline demographic and pretreatment characteristics were similar in the two groups (table 1) .
The frequency and profile of tumour-related symptoms and laboratory abnormalities were typical of advanced colorectal cancer and similar in the two groups .
Efficacy .
The confirmed responses (after 6.7 weeks) resulted in response rates of 41% (95% CI 33.3-48.6) and 23% (17.0-30.2) ,  respectively .
Duration of response and stabilisation was longer in the irinotecan group (8.6 [1.6-13.6] vs 6.2 [1.1-11.8] months ,  p<0.001) .
The vs 14.1 [0.5-27.6+] months ,  p=0.031 ,  figure 3) .
Safety .
This adverse effect occurred more frequently with the weekly than with the corresponding 2-weekly regimen in the two treatment groups .
In the irinotecan group ,  about 25% of patients developed cholinergic syndromes that were rarely severe .
QL did not differ significantly between groups .
The same trend was seen with the second imputation method .
Definitive deterioration in quality of life occurred consistently later in the irinotecan group ,  for a deterioration from baseline by 5% (p=0.03) ,  10% (p=0.06) ,  20% (p=0.04) ,  and 30% (p=0.06) .
Discussion .
Moreover ,  there was a trend towards shorter survival in the oxaliplatin group in one study .
