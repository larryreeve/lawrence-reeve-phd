Conclusion .
Therefore ,  our data favor an intensified treatment in similar cases .
SOFT TISSUE sarcomas represent less than 1% of all malignant tumors and derive from the mesenchymal tissues present in the whole human body .
However ,  the vast majorities arise from the extra-osseous and subcutaneous soft tissue of the limbs .
Their natural history is partially known and clinical decisions rely on a few simple and well-recognized prognostic factors such as size ,  grading ,  and location .
A second generation of randomized ,  control-based ,  adjuvant trials started in the early 1990s .
Study Design and Staging .
Selection Criteria .
Local Treatment .
Radical surgery consisted of amputation in case of massive involvement of critical structures or compartmental resection in highly selected patients .
Adjuvant Treatment .
Toxicity and Follow-Up .
Toxicities were graded according to World Health Organization criteria .
Statistical Considerations .
The checklist with the allocated groups was sent back to the responsible physician .
RESULTS .
The present article deals with a minimum observation time of 36 months calculated from the date of randomization of the last patient (11 of 96) .
Local Treatment .
Chemotherapy and Toxicity .
In 8% of these cases ,  the delay was between 7 and 14 days ,  thus representing the real recovery time from previous toxicity .
There was a subsequent slight and constant decrease in the administered doses of mainly EPI ,  which was in accordance with the predefined reduction scheme and testifies to the aggressiveness of the program .
Prophylactic oral antibiotics were given in an additional eight cases .
Follow-Up Data .
All deaths except one (in the control arm) were disease related .
Intention-To-Treat Analysis for Survival .
Overall DFS .
Local DFS .
Metastasis-Free Survival .

DISCUSSION .
Adjuvant treatment of localized soft tissue sarcomas is controversial because no sufficient and convincing data are available .
These developments created new interest in the use of dose-intensification for advanced disease27-31 and the planning of new trials of adjuvant treatment .
The toxicity of the program was not negligible .
No other acute or chronic toxicities were reported .
This P value was reached ,  and the protocol was closed .
Moreover ,  this treatment option5,32,33 was chosen for those patients presenting with locally far-advanced disease or with disease approaching critical structures (nerves and vessels) ,  therefore a high incidence of local relapse could be foreseen .
Time is a crucial issue in oncology and in the development of metastatic disease from high-risk soft tissue sarcomas .
