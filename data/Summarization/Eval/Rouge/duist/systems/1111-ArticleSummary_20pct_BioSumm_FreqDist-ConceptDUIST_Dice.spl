Additional risk factors for recurrence ,  e.g. ,  large tumor diameter (LTD) ,  deep stromal invasion (DSI) ,  and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces (CLS) found on microscopic examination have been only recently recognized and less extensively investigated than lymph node metastases .
An analysis of data on 575 women enrolled in a previous Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) study of clinical and pathologic predictors of surgically treated stage carcinoma of the cervix confirmed the roles of LTD ,  DSI ,  and CLS as risk factors ,  increasing the probability of cancer recurrence at 3 years from 2 to 31% .
In 1988 the GOG initiated a prospective randomized study (GOG #92) ,  reported here ,  to investigate the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy for Stage I cervical cancer patients treated by conventional radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who were at high risk for recurrence ,  because of LTD ,  DSI ,  CLS ,  but excluding patients with lymph node metastases .
The GOG #92 multicenter prospective randomized study was designed to determine whether postoperative pelvic radiotherapy following radical hysterectomy and pelvic node dissection would reduce the rate of recurrence and decrease the mortality in Stage IB cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter ,  deep stromal invasion by tumor ,  and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces found on microscopic examination .
The study’s target sample size was set at 169 eligible patients based on a desire to detect a 55% decrease in recurrence rate (exponential model with l 5 0.01 recurrences/month) with the use of radiation therapy .
In 1993 ,  the sample size goal was increased because of the lower than expected recurrence rate ,  a better estimate of the change in the recurrence rate over time ,  and a small ,  but significant ,  frequency of noncompliance in the radiation therapy (RT) regimen .
Patients were eligible for the study if they had primary Stage IB squamous ,  adenosquamous carcinoma ,  or adenocarcinoma of cervix initially treated with a standard radical hysterectomy and who had negative lymph nodes but one of the previously described combination of risk factors .
Radical hysterectomy required removal of the uterus and contiguous parametrial tissue to its most lateral extent along with paravaginal tissue and upper quarter of the vagina along the proximal uterosacral ligaments .
Pelvic lymphadenectomy required bilateral removal of all nodal tissue and skeletonization of all vessels from the mid portion of the psoas muscle to uterer medially including the hypogastric artery and vein and from the obturator fossa anterior to the obturator nerve .
Institutional pathologists measured the depth of stromal tumor invasion with a millimeter ruler and made a determination of a presence or absence of CLS .
Other eligibility criteria for enrollment into the study included normal blood counts ,  normal liver and kidney function ,  absence of genitourinary tract abnormality as determined by intravenous pyelogram ,  renal sonogram ,  or computerized tomography ,  and absence of intercurrent diseases or other conditions that might not permit completion of the study or the required follow-up .
The pelvic irradiation was given with a fourfield technique with a megavoltage beam ,  although cobalt-60 was allowed if the SSD was greater than 80 cm. Radiation dose was from 46 Gy in 23 fractions to 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions ,  5 fractions per week .
Patients were to be evaluated by physical examination ,  blood counts ,  blood chemistries ,  and chest x-rays ,  every 3 months during the first 2 years of follow-up ,  and every 6 months during the subsequent years .
Results of these tests as well as changes of therapy ,  adverse effects ,  progression ,  or death were reported .
All histology slides were reviewed by two pathologists of the GOG Pathology Committee who measured the depth of stromal invasion expressed in thirds of cervical thickness and ascertained the presence or absence of the capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement and the tumor cell type .
The Radiotherapy Committee examined therapy forms ,  diagrams of irradiated fields ,  dosimetry curves ,  and portal fields for each external field .
There were 128 (46%) patients with the risk factors of positive CLS and deep one-third stromal invasion ,  65 (23%) had positive CLS ,  middle third stromal invasion and tumor size $2 cm ,  82 (30%) had negative CLS ,  middle or deep third stromal invasion and a $4-cm tumor ,  and 2 (0.7%) had positive CLS ,  superficial stromal invasion ,  and tumor size $5 cm (Table 3) .
Thirty-nine (27.9%) of the 140 women in the NFT group developed cancer recurrence ,  27 (19.3%) local (vagina or pelvis) ,  and 10 (7.1%) distant .
The Cox model analysis indicated that when adjusting for all combinations of the three risk factors—tumor size ,  CLS ,  and the depth of invasion—the risk of recurrence was significantly reduced by 44% in the radiation group (P 5 0.019 ,  one-tail) .
In an attempt to evaluate the impact of this imbalance ,  the log–rank test was recalculated assuming the first five patients lost (the excess number) in the RT group recurred at the time of their last clinical evaluation .
Nine (7.0%) of the 128 patients who received radiotherapy had 11 episodes of grade 3 (severe) or 4 (life-threatening) adverse effects compared to 3 (2.1%) from the NFT group .
Of the 3 patients with grade 4 toxicities ,  1 patient had a complication involving the urogenital tract ,  1 gastrointestinal ,  and 1 both hematologic and urogenital toxicity .
Other serious adverse effects regressed either spontaneously (transient paraplegia in one patient) ,  or after treatment (percutaneous nephrostomies for bilateral ureteral obstruction and transfusion of packed cells for severe anemia with a drop of hematocrit to 20%) .
Both large tumor diameter and deep stromal invasion are indices of large tumor volume ,  conceivably affecting cancer progression and its metastatic spread .
However ,  Roche and Norris questioned the validity of the CLS finding because ,  as they state ,  if enough sections are made ,  most cases might show vascular invasion .
Nevertheless ,  we found tumor diameter to be the most significant risk factors in the Cox model analysis of our study results ,  confirming multiple data sets which demonstrate that the size of the primary cancer is critical for local control despite the imprecision of measurement .
We reanalyzed our results using the Cox model trying to simplify the formula or to use only a single risk factor as a predictor .
A detailed GOG clinical pathologic study had established that certain patients with poor prognostic factors related to the primary tumor (i.e. ,  large tumor size ,  deep stromal invasion ,  and capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement) but without lymph node involvement had a risk of recurrence of 31% after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy .
The present prospective randomized study showed that adjunctive radiotherapy significantly reduced the number of cancer recurrences in women with the above risk factors by 44% and that the difference in recurrences between irradiated and nonirradiated patients was statistically significant at the P 5 0.019 level .
Especially vulnerable to adverse radiation effects are the bladder and the ureters due to compromised circulation from surgical dissection and the intestines because of adhesions and reduced motility .
