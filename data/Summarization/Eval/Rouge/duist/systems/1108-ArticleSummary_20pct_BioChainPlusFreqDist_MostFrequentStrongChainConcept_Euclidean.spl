The optimal treatment of large stage IB cervical cancer has been a source of controversy since the late 1960s .
Pelvic radiation was delivered with the four-field technique with x-ray accelerators of at least 4-MV photons at a distance of at least 100 cm. The treatment field was set to extend 3 cm beyond the known extent of disease and to encompass iliac and lower common iliac lymph nodes .
Treatment with cisplatin was withheld if the total white-cell count fell below 3000 per cubic millimeter or if creatinine clearance fell below 50 ml per minute .
We estimated that 173 patients were needed in each treatment group in order to be able to detect a 40 percent decrease in the recurrence rate in the group given radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
At the time of this analysis ,  69 patients in the group receiving the control regimen had had a recurrence of disease and 49 had died — 88 percent of the number of deaths needed for a final analysis of survival .
Randomization was carried out by a block arrangement ,  the treatment assignments were stratified according to center and to whether para-aortic lymph nodes were evaluated surgically ,  with approximately equal numbers of patients assigned to each group .
The Cox model was used to evaluate the difference between treatment regimens ,  adjust for prognostic factors ,  and estimate the relative likelihood (and 95 percent confidence intervals) of survival and progression-free survival .
The first stopping rule was chosen to reject the null hypothesis at the 1 percent level ,  whereas the second was chosen so that the level of rejection for both interim tests was 2 percent .
Three of these patients had been randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone ,  and two had been assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin .
Pretreatment surgical evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes was optional and was performed in 13 patients (7 percent) assigned to radiotherapy alone and 14 patients (8 percent) assigned to radiotherapy and cisplatin .
There was a slightly higher percentage of patients with grade 3 tumors in the combined-therapy group (38 percent ,  vs. 31 percent in the radiotherapy group) .
Four patients assigned to the cisplatin regimen (2 percent) received no cisplatin .
A total of 164 patients (90 percent) received four or more courses of cisplatin .
Otherwise ,  compliance with radiotherapy with respect to the dose ,  the volume ,  and the total treatment was good and was similar between the two groups (Table 2) .
Extrafascial hysterectomy was performed after radiotherapy in 168 patients (90 percent) in the group given radiotherapy alone and 175 patients (96 percent) in the group given radiotherapy and cisplatin .
There were significantly more hysterectomy specimens without detectable cancer in the combined-therapy group than in the group given radiotherapy alone (52 percent vs. 41 percent ,  P=0.04) .
There were no treatment-related deaths ,  but 64 patients (35 percent) in the combined-therapy group had grade 3 (moderate) or grade 4 (severe) adverse effects ,  as compared with 25 patients (13 percent) in the group given radiotherapy alone .
The disease recurred in 69 patients in the group given radiotherapy alone (37 percent) and 38 patients given radiotherapy and cisplatin (21 percent) (Table 4) .
The relative risk of recurrence in the combined-therapy group as compared with the group given radiotherapy alone was 0.51 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.34 to 0.75) .
Forty-nine of the patients in the group given radiotherapy alone died of cervical cancer (26 percent) ,  as compared with 27 of the patients in the group given radiotherapy and cisplatin (15 percent) (Table 4) .
The relative risk of death in the combined-therapy group as compared with the group given radiotherapy alone was 0.54 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.34 to 0.86) .
The threeyear survival rates were 74 percent in the group given radiotherapy alone and 83 percent in the combined-therapy group (P=0.008 by the log-rank test) (Fig. 2) .
The treatment of women with bulky stage IB cervical cancers has historically been only partially satisfactory ,  with survival rates of 70 to 75 percent ,  substantially below the rates of 88 to 92 percent expected with smaller stage IB cancers .
Weekly treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy has been assessed in several phase 2 studies .
Of the 369 eligible patients in our study who were scheduled to undergo hysterectomy after the completion of radiotherapy ,  93 percent did undergo the surgery .
In the earlier Gynecologic Oncology Group study that assessed the value of extrafascial hysterectomy after radiotherapy ,  surgery was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of relapses in the pelvic region ,  but the overall risk of recurrence was not significantly reduced (relative risk ,  0.76 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.52 to 1.12) and there was no significant difference in survival (relative risk of death ,  0.91) .
The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment ,  but they share a common result ,  all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin .
This remarkable consistency offers a compelling reason to consider cisplatin therapy in combination with radiotherapy as a new standard of care for patients with bulky stage IB ,  stage IIB through IVA ,  and high-risk cervical cancers .
