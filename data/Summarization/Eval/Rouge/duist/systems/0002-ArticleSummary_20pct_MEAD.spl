CERVICAL cancer is the second most frequent cancer among women worldwide and the most frequent cancer among women in Africa Asia and South America .
In the United States where screening for cervical cancer is readily available most women who are found to have cervical cancer were not screened regularly .
As a result about 25 percent of patients with cervical cancer in the United States present with locally advanced disease stage IIB through IVA according to the staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics .
The ability of radiotherapy to cure locally advanced cervical cancer is limited by the size of the tumor because the doses required to treat large tumors exceed the limit of toxicity in normal tissue .
Efforts to overcome this problem have included the use of large-particle radiotherapy the use of different radiation-fractionation schedules and the concurrent use of hyperthermia or chemotherapy .
Theoretically chemotherapy and radiotherapy could have a synergistic effect for example the chemotherapy might increase the sensitivity of the tumor to radiation .
Moreover radiotherapy could be used for local disease while chemotherapy is used for systemic disease .
The concurrent use of single-drug and multiple-drug regimens with radiotherapy has been tested in women with cervical cancer but combination therapy has not gained wide acceptance .
The Gynecologic Oncology Group has performed several prospective randomized studies of the effect of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in women with locally advanced cervical cancer .
Radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea has been compared in separate trials with radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy and concomitant therapy with misonidazole and with radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil and Whitney CW: unpublished data .
However treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and radiotherapy resulted in greater improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival than did treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy Whitney CW: unpublished data .
At the time we were developing the protocol used in the current study radiotherapy plus concomitant chemotherapy with hydroxyurea was the standard combined-therapy regimen for advanced cervical cancer because an early analysis of the combination of radiation cisplatin and fluorouracil failed to show improved progression-free survival .
However myelosuppression is a limiting toxic effect of treatment with hydroxyurea whereas cisplatin is less myelosuppressive and can be given weekly during radiotherapy with acceptable levels of toxicity .
In addition the responses in phase 2 trials of this chemotherapy regimen with radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer and in patients with head and neck cancer were favorable .
Therefore we undertook a randomized study in which all women with locally advanced cervical cancer received local radiation as well as weekly concomitant treatment with cisplatin alone the combination of cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea or hydroxyurea alone .
The length of delays in radiotherapy in days was calculated by subtracting the planned duration of radiotherapy the number of prescribed fractions plus 2 weekend days for every five fractions plus 10 days for each implant from the actual duration of radiotherapy .
At the time of this analysis 104 patients had had progression of disease in the control group and 89 patients had died with or without disease progression - 86 percent of the number of deaths needed for a final analysis of survival .
Thus because of the large difference in outcome among the treatment groups and the similarity between the rates of survival and progression-free survival within each of the treatment groups this analysis is the final analysis of survival and progression-free survival .
From April 1992 to April 1997 575 patients were enrolled: 192 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin 191 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea and 192 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with hydroxyurea .
The rates of progression-free survival at 24 months were 67 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy 64 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea and 47 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
The frequencies of other hematologic effects of both grade 3 and grade 4 - predominantly granulocytopenia - in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea therapy were approximately double those in the other two groups P 0.001. We found higher rates of survival and progression-free survival among patients who were treated with radiotherapy and either cisplatin alone or cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea than among patients who were treated with radiotherapy and hydroxyurea alone .
However in a small study of 45 patients with cervical cancer radiotherapy and chemotherapy with cisplatin 25 mg per square meter per week increased the rate of local control by 35 percent P 0.025 for the comparison with radiotherapy alone but there was no long-term improvement in survival .
In the phase 3 study by Morris et al .
whose results are reported in this issue of the Journal radiotherapy in combination with treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil significantly improved the rates of disease-free survival and overall survival among women with stage IB through IVA cervical cancer .
In our study the duration of radiotherapy and the dose of radiation were similar among the three regimensimplying that the differences in progression-free survival and survival were related to the chemotherapy .
Our results demonstrate the superiority of radiotherapy and chemotherapy either with cisplatin alone or with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer stage IIB III or IVA without metastasis to the para-aortic lymph nodes .
