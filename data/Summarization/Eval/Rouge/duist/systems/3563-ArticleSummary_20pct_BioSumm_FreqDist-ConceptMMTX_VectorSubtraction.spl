Intestinal anastomosis has been successfully performed for more than 150 years using a variety of techniques ,  materials ,  and devices .
The only appreciable shortcoming of the two-layer technique is that it is somewhat tedious and time-consuming to perform .
All adult patients requiring intestinal anastomosis at Denver Health Medical Center from September 1996 to September 1999 were considered eligible .
Patients were also excluded if the surgeon did not believe that either technique could be used because of technical concerns such as edema or scarring .
All layers of the bowel wall except the mucosa were incorporated .
The complication of abscess without fistula was also included in the analysis because it is potentially related to the anastomosis .
Each packet of silk sutures cost $9.41 ,  and each packet of polyglycolic acid suture cost $1.88 .
Each packet of polypropylene suture cost $4.61 .
Data were analyzed based on the intention-to-treat principle .
P < .05 was considered to indicate statistical significance .
RESULTS .
DISCUSSION .
Since then ,  the technique has remained essentially unchanged except for the evolution of suture material for the inner layer .
In the United States ,  the first mention of this technique was by Allen et al , 18 who presented their results with its use before the Texas Surgical Society in 1979 .
Given that ,  for a new technique to be acceptable ,  it only needs to be demonstrated safe by a number of different surgeons in a large number of patients .
Further ,  most of the anastomoses in this study were performed by residents ,  who were often unfamiliar with the technique or were performing their first intestinal anastomosis .
Most of the difference is accounted for by the cost of the silk suture packets ,  at $9.41 each .
Another factor is related to the properties of a continuous monofilament plastic suture line .
In contrast ,  this can easily occur to the tissue enclosed by an interrupted suture .
It also costs less than any other method and can be safely introduced into a surgical training program with no apparent increase in complications .
