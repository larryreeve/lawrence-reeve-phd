To test the hypothesis that adding radiation to adjuvant systemic therapy improves the outcome in patients with breast cancer ,  we designed a randomized trial in 1978 in British Columbia .
Chemotherapy .
The postmastectomy chest wall received a dose of 37.5 Gy through two tangential fields .
A direct internal mammary field delivered a dose of 35 Gy at a depth of 3 cm. All the fields were treated with cobalt-60 .
Eleven patients (3.5 percent) were lost to follow-up — three (1.9 percent) from the chemotherapy group and eight (4.9 percent) from the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group .
In all the analyses ,  the data were censored as of the date of that follow-up .
RESULTS .
All Patients .
Table 2 and Figures 1 through 4 show the results in the two groups of patients .
In the group treated with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy ,  79 of 164 patients had recurrences — locoregional ,  systemic ,  or both — as compared with 97 of 154 patients in the group given chemotherapy alone .
The reduction in the relative risk of a recurrence that was obtained by adding radiation to chemotherapy was similar in the subgroup with one to three positive nodes and the subgroup with four or more positive nodes (Table 3) .
Limited apical lung fibrosis developed in most of the irradiated patients ,  but only one had interstitial pneumonitis requiring corticosteroids ,  with full resolution on chest radiography several weeks later .
The incidence of second cancers and the associated mortality were distributed evenly between the two groups (Table 4) .
It is possible that we will see additional benefit in overall survival ,  because at this writing 19 patients in the chemotherapy group remain alive with systemic recurrence ,  as compared with only 9 in the combined-treatment group ,  most of these 28 patients are expected to die of breast cancer .
Also ,  in various past trials different areas were encompassed in the irradiated volume ,  and the trials differed in techniques of radiation ,  treatment planning ,  age ,  nodal status ,  and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy .
The patients in that study were similar to those in our cohort ,  there was a large and homogeneous group of premenopausal ,  node-positive patients treated with chemotherapy and five-field radiotherapy .
The Stockholm trial also provides evidence that locoregional radiotherapy in node-positive patients decreases the risk of systemic metastases .
Therefore ,  it may be necessary to add nodal radiation to breast irradiation in premenopausal node-positive patients who are treated with partial mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy .
The routine use of radiation in all node-positive patients would represent a substantial shift in treatment for breast cancer .
