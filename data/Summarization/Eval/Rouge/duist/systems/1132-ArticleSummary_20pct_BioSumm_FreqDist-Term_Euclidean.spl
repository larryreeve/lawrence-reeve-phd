ALTHOUGH much progress has been made in the early detection and control of carcinoma of the cervix since the introduction of  the Papanicolau test ,  it is estimated that about 13,500 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 1990 in  the United States with 6,000 patients dying from the disease .
Here we report the results of this study .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Patient Entry Criteria and Evaluation .
The International  Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging criteria were used in this study .
No patient underwent lymph node biopsy to confirm the radiologic  findings .
Of these ,  16 were excluded from this analysis .
Patient characteristics are outlined  in Table 1 .
Treatment Regimens .
Following external-beam irradiation ,  a single low-dose rate  intracavitary application was performed .
Potassium chloride at 20 mEq/L and magnesium sulfate were added as needed .
Dexamethasone and metoclopramide were  used as antiemetics .
Response Criteria .
End Points .
Blood  counts were performed weekly and the lowest granulocyte and platelet counts recorded .
Statistical Analysis .
Patients were randomly allocated to the two treatment arms by drawing cards in sealed envelopes .
Actuarial survival curves were compared by the log-rank method .
Comparisons of variables between groups  were based on the X2 test .
RESULTS .
No patient was lost to follow-up .
The overall 5-year actuarial  survival for the two groups is shown in Fig 1 .
Toxicity .
Of greater concern was the bleomycin-related pulmonary toxicity .
Late complications are shown in Table 7 and consisted of proctitis ,  cystitis ,  fistula ,  and vaginal stenosis .
During  atheterization ,  her bladder was perforated .
Postmortem study showed no evidence of  cervical cancer .
DISCUSSION .
Treatments were well  tolerated ,  and some longterm remissions were observed .
This may explain why in spite of a satisfactory rate of response following neoadjuvant CT ,  there was no  improvement in local tumor control ,  and survival was adversely affected .
Some randomized studies have ,  in  fact ,  showed worse survival with the use of neoadjuvant CT .
Thus ,  a PR or even a CR could therefore  be of questionable value in determining therapeutic effectiveness ,  as tumor masses would be still regressing while the  subclinical clonogenic cell repopulation is accelerating .
In fact ,  this approach might be detrimental ,  as demonstrated in the present study .
