In retrospective studies ,  the incidence of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) was estimated to be approximately 3% to 4% after a cumulative DOX dose of 450 mg/m2 and 6% to 10% after 550 mg/m2 ,  the incidence of CHF rises steeply after higher cumulative doses.On the basis of these retrospective studies ,  an empiric dose limitation of 450 to 550 mg/m2 has been recommended when DOX is used on a standard every three week schedule .
The two compounds have similar pharmacokinetic behavior in humans ,  although EPI is eliminated more rapidly .
In two clinical phase I studies ,  EPI was found to have acceptable toxicity at doses of 85 to 90 mg/m2 given intravenously (IV) every three weeks .
Other criteria for eligibility included a performance status of - 50% (Karnofsky scale) ,  a WBC count - 4,000/14L ,  a platelet count >- 100,000/L ,  normal serum bilirubin levels ( < 1.5 mg/dL) ,  and objectively evaluable or measurable disease .
Pretreatment Evaluation and Follow-up Studies Pretreatment evaluation of patients included complete history and physical examination ,  complete blood cell count (CBC) ,  12-channel biochemical profile ,  serum creatinine ,  chest roentgenogram ,  ECG ,  and bone scan .
Biochemical profiles were repeated every six weeks .
Patients were stratified for performance status (Karnofsky scale < 70% v > 80%) and for estrogen receptor status of the primary or a metastatic lesion (positive or unknown v negative) .
The dose of EPI was 85 mg/m2 ,  and the dose of DOX was 60 mg/m2 .
Evaluation of ToxicityThe percent of projected dose received was calculated for each patient as the average of all doses the patient received (mg/m 2) - 85 if the patient was randomized to EPI and - 60 if the patient was randomized to DOX .
Several other comparisons ,  such as percent of projected dose ,  used the two-sample Wilcoxon test .
Dose AttenuationThe percent of projected dose received by patients in each arm was compared .
The median actual dose administered was 100% of the projected dose of EPI and 86% of the planned dose of DOX (Wilcoxon test ,  P = .01) .
The inevaluable patient randomized to treatment with DOX refused to return for follow-up counts or further therapy ,  but was alive four months after her only dose of DOX ,  the patient is also excluded from analysis of hematologic toxicity .
The median duration of PR for patients responding to EPI was 11.9 months ,  whereas median duration of PR on the DOX arm was 7.1 months .
Noncardiac ToxicityHematologic toxicity was similar in the two arms (Table 3) .
The median WBC nadir was 2.0 x 103/gL (range ,  0.1 to 8.6) and the median platelet nadir was 132 x 103//pL (range ,  20.0 to 279.0) in patients receiving EPI ,  the median WBC nadir was 1.8 x 10'/3tL (range ,  0.3 to .9) and median platelet nadir was 130 x 103/pL (range 24.0 to 253.0) in patients on the DOX arm .
One patient receiving EPI died of nadir sepsis .
Because all patients had been treated previously with chemotherapy ,  the degree and incidence of alopecia is difficult to assess ,  however ,  hair loss was noted in 50% of patients treated with EPI and 35% of those treated with DOX .
Of the 18 evaluable patients treated with DOX ,  seven had prior radiation exposure to the heart ,  two had hypertension ,  and two had both hypertension and prior radiotherapy .
The median cumulative dose to laboratory cardiotoxicity in these patients was 892 mg/m2 of EPI and 360 mg/m 2 of DOX .
The median dose to development of cardiotoxicity for all evaluable patients was 935 mg/m2 for EPI and 468 mg/m2 for DOX (Fig 2A) .
Overall ,  100% of the planned dose of EPI (85 mg/m2) was administered ,  however ,  only 86% (52 mg/m2) of the planned dose of DOX was given .
Thus ,  all EPI doses were multiplied by 52/85 to compare the two drugs in equivalent units ,  and Kaplan-Meier estimates plotted (Fig 2B) .
Of the ten remaining patients on the EPI arm and elevenpatients on the DOX arm who are not evaluable for laboratory cardiac toxicity because they did not have a second RNCA study ,  the total cumulative doses of EPI and DOX were not significantly different ,  whether or not myelosuppressiveequivalent doses were taken into consideration .
Of the patients who developed symptomatic CHF on the EPI arm ,  one had prior radiotherapy and one had hypertension .
On the DOX arm ,  one of the patients who developed CHF had prior radiation exposure to the heart ,  one had hypertension ,  and one had prior radiotherapy as well as hypertension .
There was a statistically significant greater cumulative dose to CHF for patients receiving EPI (log rank test ,  P - .008) with and without adjustment for the difference in myelosuppressive potency .
Among patients who experienced clinical CHF ,  however ,  the median cumulative doses to CHF were 1,134 mg/m2 of EPI and 492 mg/m 2 of DOX .
Although empiric dose restriction is widely practiced ,  many patients experience the onset of CHF before they receive 550 mg/m2 of the drug .
Thirteen percent of patients in another recent study developed CHF at a median dose of 405 mg/m 2 when DOX was given on an every three week schedule. 22 With optimal monitoring ,  one might be able to detect subclinical cardiac injury and prevent CHF by stopping the drug ,  this implies ,  however ,  the interruption of effective antineoplastic therapy .
Two recent studies that used endomyocardial biopsy have demonstrated that a larger total cumulative dose of DOX can be tolerated if the drug is given weekly or by continuous intravenous infusion .
The difference in cardiac toxicity was manifested by the difference in total cumulative dose at which changes in LVEF occurred (Fig 2A) ,  as well as by the difference in dose at which clinical CHF was seen (EPI ,  1,035 to 1,234 mg/m 2 v DOX ,  456 to 600 mg/m2) .
Although these results could have been affected by the greater incidence of cardiac irradiation inpatients treated with DOX ,  only three patients who had received such radiotherapy actually developed CHF ,  one on the EPI arm and two on the DOX arm .
In the present study ,  each drug was given every three weeks in doses that produced equivalent degrees of myelosuppression ,  a preplanned limitation on the total cumulative dose of EPI was not used .
Brambilla and coworkers in Milan33 studied equal doses (75 mg/m2) of both drugs every three weeks ,  they limited the total cumulative dose of each drug to 600 mg/m2 .
A third study34 compared two multidrug combinations in which 5-fluorouracil (F) 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide (C) 500 mg/m2 were combined with an equal dosage (50 mg/m2) of either EPI (FEC [5-fluorouracil ,  EPI ,  cyclophosphamidel) or DOX (FAC) and administered every three weeks ,  the total dose of EPI was limited to 750 mg/m2 and of DOX to 550 mg/m2 .
Since the present study did not use a fixed limitation for dose of EPI ,  patients who did not have progression of tumor were treated to the point of laboratory cardiotoxicity or clinical CHF ,  therefore ,  this study provides cumulative cardiotoxicity data that are not available in the other two studies .
In contrast ,  the present study predicts an incidence of laboratory cardiotoxicity in excess of 70% for those patients who receive more than 600 mg/m2 of DOX .
Most patients in our trials received less than 550 mg/m2 of EPI ,  however ,  in 11 patients receiving cumulative EPI doses from 550 to 1,465 mg/m2 ,  RNCA abnormalities were observed in only four patients at 970 ,  1,180,1,190 ,  and 1,465 mg/m2 ,  respectively (C.W .
Assuming equal therapeutic potency ,  this analysis indicated that every three week EPI is less cardiotoxic than every three week DOX (P = .0005) and borderline less toxic than weekly DOX (P = .06) .
