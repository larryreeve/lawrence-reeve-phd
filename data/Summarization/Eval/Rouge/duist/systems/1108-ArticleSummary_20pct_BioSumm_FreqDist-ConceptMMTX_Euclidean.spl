THE American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics define stage IB cervical cancer as invasive cancer that is confined to the cervix ,  with a depth of more than 5 mm and a width of more than 7 mm. In patients with large stage IB cervical cancers ,  local control and survival are poorer than in patients with smaller stage I cancers ,  whether treated by surgery or irradiation .
Women of any age with biopsy-proved primary squamous-cell carcinoma ,  adenocarcinoma ,  or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix of stage IB (exophytic or expansile barrel-shaped tumors with a minimal diameter of 4 cm) were eligible for the study .
Patients with histologic evidence of lymph-node involvementwere not eligible ,  nor were those who had previously received radiotherapy or chemotherapy or those with a history of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer .
Radiotherapy .
External irradiation was withheld if the white-cell count fell below 1000 per cubic millimeter and was resumed once the count rose above that level .
Standard Fletcher–Suit or Henschke applicators were used .
Chemotherapy .
A maximum of six doses of cisplatin was given .
The uterine vessels were transected at the uterine wall medial to the ureters ,  which were not unroofed .
Outcome .
Statistical Analysis .
Life-table estimates were calculated according to the method of Kaplan and Meier .
The difference between groups in survival and progression-free survival was evaluated with use of the logrank test according to the intention-to-treat principle .
Differences between groups in the severity of adverse effects and the frequency of hysterectomy specimens that were negative for cancer were evaluated with use of Pearson’s chi-square test .
RESULTS .
Characteristics of the Patients .
There were no significant differences in demographic or tumor characteristics between the two groups (Table 1) .
This difference predominantly reflects the fact that there were fewer local recurrences in the combined-therapy group (16 ,  vs. 39 in the radiotherapy group) .
At the time of this analysis ,  the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher among patients in the combined-therapy group (P<0.001 by the log-rank test) (Fig. 1) .
The numbers of patients who were alive at the time of this analysis but in whom disease had recurred were 20 and 11 ,  respectively .
DISCUSSION .
This approach was ,  however ,  associated with considerable morbidity .
The promising results of these studies as well as the fact that this combination is well tolerated and easy to administer on an outpatient basis led us to evaluate it in this trial .
This difference appeared to be due to the lower rate of relapses in the pelvic region in the combined-therapy group .
There was no evidence of a difference in the frequencies of late adverse effects between the groups .
We believe that the value of hysterectomy in these patients is doubtful .
Therefore ,  radiotherapy in combination with treatment with cisplatin should be adequate for patients with bulky stage IB cervical cancer .
The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment ,  but they share a common result ,  all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin .
