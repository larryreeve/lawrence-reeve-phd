Intestinal anastomosis has been successfully performed for more than 150 years using a variety of techniques ,  materials ,  and devices .
Of these ,  the method that has proven successful in most situations and in the hands of most surgeons has been the two-layer anastomosis using interrupted silk sutures for an outer inverted seromuscular layer and a running absorbable suture for a transmural inner layer .
Recently ,  several reports have appeared advocating a single-layer continuous anastomosis using monofilament plastic suture .
Patients requiring anastomosis to the rectum or third or fourth portion of the duodenum were excluded because the single-layer continuous method is awkward when both ends of the bowel cannot be fully mobilized .
To avoid ischemia of the anastomosis ,  the surgeon had to ensure that only enough pressure was applied to the suture while following to approximate the ends of the bowel and render the anastomosis watertight .
For two-layer anastomoses ,  three packets of 3.0 silk sutures ,  each containing five needled sutures ,  and two packets of 3.0 polyglycolic acid sutures were used .
For six patients who required more than one anastomosis ,  the same method was used for each anastomosis .
The two-layer interrupted anastomosis has its origins in the early 19th century through the experimental work of Travers and of Lembert ,  who advocated careful approximation of the serosal surfaces of the bowel and devised a method of suturing to accomplish this .
The present study demonstrates that a single-layer continuous anastomosis is similar in terms of safety to the two-layer technique ,  but that it can be constructed in a significantly shorter time and at a lower cost .
To accomplish a two-layer anastomosis ,  at least 1 cm of the serosal surface must be circumferentially cleared of mesentery ,  appendices epiploica ,  and omentum before beginning the anastomosis .
Further ,  most of the anastomoses in this study were performed by residents ,  who were often unfamiliar with the technique or were performing their first intestinal anastomosis .
The senior authors of this paper (J . M . B .  ,  E . E . M .) have used the single-layer technique exclusively for many years and can routinely perform an anastomosis in 8 to 10 minutes .
Although it is certainly possible to create an ischemic continuous anastomosis by applying too much tension while following the suture ,  Hautefeuille has argued that this is easier to avoid with a continuous suture because there is no point in the anastomosis where the bowel is completely devoid of its blood supply .
We conclude that the single-layer continuous anastomosis requires less time to construct and has a similar risk of leakage compared with the two-layer technique .
For these reasons ,  we believe the single-layer continuous anastomosis is superior to the two-layer interrupted technique .
