It possesses a broad spectrum of clinical antitumor efficacy and is the most active nonhormonal drug for the treatment of breast cancer .
Cardiac monitoring with noninvasive techniques and endomyocardial biopsy identifypatients being treated with DOX who have asymptomatic functional or morphologic cardiac abnormalities and who may be at high risk for the development of clinical congestive cardiomyopathy .
Discontinuation of therapy in these patients may prevent cardiac failure ,  but also results in curtailment of the antineoplastic effect of DOX .
It is a stereoisomer of DOX in which the hydroxyl group at the 4' position of the aminosugar side chain is epimerized (Fig 1) .
Areas of increased uptake on bone scan were further studied with roentgenograms to determine the nature of the abnormalities .
Liver scans were done only if there was elevation of the hepatic enzymes on the biochemical profile .
Blood counts were initially monitored weekly ,  and then less frequently after the pattern of myelosuppression was established .
All evaluable or measurable parameters of disease were reevaluated at least every six weeks .
Study DesignAfter determining eligibility ,  informed consent was obtained .
Clinical examination was performed prior to each dose of anthracycline .
RNCA was done with thepatients in supine position at rest and during maximum symptom limited bicycle exercise .
Images of the left ventricle were recorded by positioning the camera in the left anterior oblique position ,  using a computer-based procedure gated to the electrocardiogram .
LVEF was determined by computer-assisted analysis of left ventricular time-activity curves .
Imaging was obtained for three minutes at the point of maximal tolerable exercise .
Several other comparisons ,  such as percent of projected dose ,  used the two-sample Wilcoxon test .
All hypothesis tests were two-sided .
The characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1 .
Although all patients had received prior chemotherapy which included cyclophosphamide or other alkylating agent ,  no patient had been previously treated with mitomycin C .
Complete responses were not observed in either arm .
Six (25%) of the 24 evaluable patients treated with EPI and seven (25%) of the 28 evaluable patients on the DOX arm achieved PRs .
This patient had been extensively treated with radiation and chemotherapy before treatment on this protocol .
In general ,  the nausea and vomiting in patients on the EPI arm was less severe .
These data were also analyzed taking into consideration the difference in myelosuppressive potency between the two drugs .
The difference remains statistically significant with a P value of .04 .
This sometimes ,  but not always ,  occurred  before the development of symptomatic congestive cardiomyopathy .
Six of 11 patients who received more than 450 mg/m 2 of DOX did not develop signs or symptoms of CHF .
Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the cardiotoxic effects of DOX .
However ,  RNCA alone has also been useful in studying anthracycline cardiotoxicity .
This is similar to the 27% response rate reported by the Early Clinical Trials Group of the EORTC (European Organization for the Research on Treatment of Cancer) .
It was also similar to the combined experience in the literature with DOX as a single agent in previously treated women with breast cancer .
Whether these findings reflect an improvement in therapeutic index is dependent on the two drugs' dose relationship for therapeutic effects .
The design of these studies differed ,  however .
The observations with regard to relative cardiac toxicity in the three studies provide internally consistent and complementary data .
In the multidrug study ,  no clinical cardiac dysfunction was seen in the EPI-containing (FEC) arm .
The relatively good cardiac tolerance of EPI observed in the present breast cancer study has been confirmed in our extended phase II experience in other disorders .
Young ,  unpublished data ,  January ,  1985 ,  New York) .
In the present study ,  RNCA abnormalities correlated well with the presence of symptomatic heart failure .
The sudden onset of clinical deterioration was also reported byBristow who considered this a manifestation of a nonlinear relationship between myocardial structure and function.3 6 Likewise ,  changes in LVEF in response to stress frequently accompanied a decline in LVEF ,  but we did not observe such a decline without a concommittant change in resting LVEF .
These findings ,  which are supported by the independent work of several other investigators ,  provide encouragement for further clinical trials with EPI .
She developed evidence of laboratory cardiotoxicity after a cumulative dose of 615 mg/m of DOX .
