THE ANTIMETABOLITES methotrexate (MTX) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) have become established over the past quarter century among the most useful cancer chemotherapeutic agents .
Sequential administration of moderate doses of MTX followed by 5-FU has been reported effective in advanced head and neck cancer and colorectal cancer ,  as well as breast cancer ,  but the importance of the sequence remains uncertain .
We therefore conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial in which sequential MTX followed by 5-FU was compared to the same drugs given in the opposite order .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Patients eligible for this study had measurable or evaluable advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck , adenocarcinoma of the colon ,  rectum or stomach ,  or SCC of other primary site (Table I) .
Histopathologic confirmation of diagnosis .
Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the requirements of the institutional ethics committee .
SEQUENTIAL MTX/5-FU .
One hour later by MTX (FM) .
Variables included in the Cox models for all patients with head and neck cancer were treatment group ,  prior radiotherapy ,  performance status ,  sex ,  and prior surgery .
For previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  stage was included either as stage group or as TNM stage separately .
Other factors including stage ,  sex ,  prior radiotherapy ,  and prior surgery were not significant .
DISCUSSION .
This observation cast doubt on the clinical relevance of the sequence of administration of MTX and 5-FU .
In the small number of patients with colorectal cancer we observed a response rate of 33% (40% of evaluable patients) ,  a figure somewhat higher than that usually seen after 5-FU as a single agent ,  but the 95% confidence limits for this rate (19%-64%) emphasize that this could be a chance observation .
Since this trial was commenced ,  it has been suggested that the optimal time delay for sequence-dependent synergy of MTX and 5-FU in human cancer cell lines may be longer than the one hour used in the present study .
To our knowledge ,  these are the only prospective randomized clinical trials yet reported that test the importance of the sequence of administration of 5-FU and MTX .
