radical external beam plus intracavitary radiation continues to be the standard therapy for advanced cervical cancer to which all new therapies must be compared 
for rare patients with disease extension to the lower one third of vagina the first application to the cervix and uterus was modified to deliver 30 gy at 2 cm from the center of the sources and a second application as a line source in the vagina was used to deliver a further 20 gy at 0 5 cm depth from the surface of the vagina 5 fu was given as an infusion from days 1 to 4 inclusive and on treatment days 22 to 25 inclusive 
the radiation scheme used in this study conforms to those guidelines although the inability to apply intracavitary radiation in 10 of these patients with advanced disease wasdisappointing 
to reach the conclusion that concurrent chemotherapy truly adds benefit to results achievable with radiation alone it is important that the radiation be delivered in an optimal manner with adequate doses at point a 80 to 90 gy and limited overall treatment times 
these include modifications of radiation treatment volume or fractionation including extended field radiation hyperfractionated rt strategies to overcome the negative impact of tumor hypoxia such as hyperbaric oxygen or hypoxic cell radiation sensitizers 
the changed fractionation scheme using smaller than conventional fraction sizes and a 6 increase in total dose was designed to be approximately biologically equivalent for tumor control to that of standard radiation yet lead to reduced complications 
the second rationale for use of the partially hyperfractionated radiation scheme was to attempt to maximize the dose of radiation delivered during the infusion of 5 fu 
intracavitary irradiation was to be delivered as soon after external beam therapy as possible using a linear source without colpostats usually of cesium 137 
in vitro data suggested that the addition of infusional 5 fu to radiation therapy would enhance the radiation effect 
a factorial design was planned to test to what degree observed differences were attributable to either factor 
it was loaded to extend at least 2 cm above the clinically identified superior extent of disease and inferiorly to 1 cm below the cervix or 1 cm below the lowest extent of vaginal disease identified after external therapy 
the reduced fraction size in arms c and d was designed to attempt to take advantage of knowledge of the affect of fraction size on late complications and to determine whether complication rates were decreased by using decreased fraction size 
additionally the changed fractionation scheme with delivery of two fractions daily at the beginning and end of therapy was designed to maximize the potential for interaction between 5 fu and radiation and to potentially reduce complication rates 
the optimal dosing schedule for maximizing cell kill with infusional 5 fu and radiation remains undefined but laboratory data suggested greater effects with increasing dose and prolonged exposure to 5 fu and when drug was present for intervals in excess of 48 h after radiation 
figure 1 demonstrates the study design the four arm study was designed to determine whether any significant differences in outcome were evident between arms a and d and to be explanatory with respect to causation 
in addition to modifications of radiation therapy multiple studies have investigated and are investigating strategies that combine radiation with chemotherapy either as neoadjuvant or concurrent administration 
the actuarial 5 year disease free survival was 76 compared to 65 for hyperfractionated irradiation plus 5 fu 58 for hyperfractionated irradiation alone and 39 for standard radiation 
theoretical explanations for the lack of benefit may include a reduction in tumor cell kill due to the reduced radiation fraction size and or an insufficient compensatory increase in total dose to compensate for the reduced fraction size 
oral mucositis due to 5 fu was graded on a scale of 0 to 4 1 pain without frank ulceration 2 ulceration present but able to eat 3 ulceration requiring a liquid diet 4 alimentation not possible 
one hundred and ninety of 221 patients received external beam radiation using the box technique while 31 were treated with a parallel pair 
seven of these 23 patients received a compensatory boost of external radiation in doses of 6 to 16 gy 
patients were randomized to receive either a standard external beam pelvic irradiation ebrt in a dose of 5000 cgy in 25 fractions defined at 100 versus b rt as in arm a with infusional intravenous 5 fu in a dose of 1 g m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of rt c partially hyperfractionated rt 5280 cgy in 33 fractions 2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of rt or d arm c with the same infusional 5 fu 
to date the only reported randomized studies of concurrent therapy are those of hydroxyurea and radiation versus radiation alone 
the benefits observed occurred in relation to the use of concurrent 5 fu rather than to the change in radiation fractionation 
after ebrt all patients were planned to receive low dose rate intracavitary irradiation to deliver a dose of 40 gy at point a 
the mechanism by which 5 fu exerts benefit is unknown but may be simply by additivity due to its independent cytotoxic effect rather than to an interaction with radiation 
if differences were to be observed in pelvic control and survival in arm d versus arm a this could be due to a change in either or both factors 
the treatment related factors examined were the use of intracavitary radiation the use of 5 fu and the fractionation scheme standard versus partially hyperfractionated 
in the standard radiation plus 5 fu arm b 52 of the 53 patients received the standard dose prescription 
the results reported for trials of neoadjuvant cisplatin containing chemotherapy prior to radiation have been disappointing with six randomized trials showing no advantage in local control or survival and possibly some detrimental effect 
in order to detect a 20 improvement in pelvic control rate from an expected 50 for arm a to 70 for arm d assuming an alpha of 0 05 and beta of 0 20 73 patients in each of four treatment arms would be required for a total of 292 patients 
these advantages include no delay in the start of definitive irradiation no prolongation of overall treatment time thus minimizing the theoretical risk of accelerated clonogen proliferation during the antineoplastic course and possible interaction of the concurrently administered chemotherapy with radiation through such mechanisms as inhibition of repair of radiation damage cell synchronization recruitment of nonproliferating cells into cell cycle and reduction of the hypoxic fraction 
in order to detect an improvement of 15 in survival in arms c and d compared to that seen in arms a and b assuming a 40 cause specific survival rate in arm a and an alpha of 0 05 and beta of 0 2 the total number of patients required was 272 
the direction of benefit in favor of 5 fu with standard radiation compared to the other treatments was the same in strata 1 and 2 
in the partially hyperfractionated rt with 5 fu arm d 3 of 58 received nonprescribed doses of 46 gy to 52 gy in 29 to 32 fractions 
cox s proportional hazards model was used to examine the variables which might contribute to pelvic control or survival within stratum 1 
a similar analysis compared all those treated with standard radiation to those treated with hyperfractionated irradiation 
of the patients randomized to receive standard radiation with 5 fu four received no chemotherapy and three received less than 1 g m2 with each course 
the time to development of serious late complications was seven to 53 months median 16 months 
the radiation energy to be used was 6 mev or greater 
the observed differences in pelvic control and survival in favor of the standard radiation and concurrent 5 fu associated with the addition of 5 fu rather than the change in radiation schedule 
a posterior midline attenuator of two half value layers 3 cm in width at the midplane of the pelvis was used to reduce the dose to the bladder and rectum
