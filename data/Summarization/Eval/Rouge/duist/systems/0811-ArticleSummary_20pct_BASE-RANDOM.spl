Nevertheless ,  there is little evidence of effective therapy for such patients other than symptomatic and supportive care. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is considered by many as the standard of chemotherapy ,  but in larger experiences with this agent ,  response rates have only been in the 15% to 20% range .
We chose for our evaluation the combinations of 5- FU with thymidine ,  with N-(phosphonacetyl)-Laspartic acid (PALA) ,  with levamisole ,  and with methyl CCNU ,  vincristine ,  and streptozotocin (MOF-Strept) .
Rustum demonstrated in colon 26 tumor and in a transplanted colon tumor in rats that thymidine plus 5-FU produced a significant prolongation of survival time when compared with 5-FU alone .
Studies by Woodcock et al ,  by Kirkwood and Frei ,  and by Vogel et a1 demonstrated that in humans ,  pretreatment with thymidine increased the biologic activity of 5-FU up to eight-fold as measured by hematologic toxicity .
PALA is a potent inhibitor of aspartate transcarbamylase and has a broad spectrum of activity in animal model tumor screens .
It has also been shown to have immunomodulatory effects .
Contraindications to selection included a WBC count < 4.000/mm or a platelet count < 130.000/mm. a serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL. complete disability (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group IECOG] performance score 4). recent major surgery (exploration and biopsy only. < 14 days ,  resection or bypass surgery ,  < 21 days) ,  an uncontrolled infectious process. frequent vomiting or severe anorexia ,  any previous chemotherapy ,  and intensive radiation to the axial skeleton within the preceding 4 weeks .
Treatment Methodology .
Courses were repeated every 5 weeks. 5-FU plus thymidine .
On day I. 5-FU was administered 4 hours after PALA .
This corresponded to the method used by the New York Memorial group .
Treatment was continued until disease progression was documented .
The primary endpoint of our overall study was patient survival .
P values were two-sided .
RESULTS .
A total of 347 patients were randomized on this study .
The entries of two patients were cancelled after randomization ,  and ten patients were found to be ineligible .
The most unique toxicity of this regimen was a substantially increased incidence of neurologic effects .
These reactions were primarily headache (seven patients) ,  lethargy (four patients) ,  dizziness with ataxia (four patients) ,  and occasional confusion (two patients) .
One patient died in irreversible coma .
Therapeutic Results .
None of the combination regimens showed a significant advantage to 5-FU used alone .
Whereas 5-FU plus PALA was associated with the lowest regression rate ,  these regressions were of the longest median duration .
Grade of anaplasia also proved to be a powerful prognostic predictor .
The results of this study were singularly discouraging .
In each of the regimens we tested ,  drug dosages and scheduling were admittedly largely arbitrary .
Further exploration of the 5-FU-PALA theme might be justified on this basis .
The total dose of 5-FU in this combination was only 12% of the dosage of 5-FU used alone that would produce a comparable degree of hematologic toxicity .
In agreement with the New York Memorial Group ,  and in contrast with the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group results ,  we did record a moderately high response rate with the MOFStrept combination .
The fact that all tissue was subjected to a common pathology review process may have produced sufficient uniformity of grading to allow this characteristic to be a useful predictor of survival .
Whereas the results of this study were negative ,  these should not discourage continued efforts to exploit the biochemical modulation approaches .
We would hope this could be done more successfully with increasing knowledge of how best to apply the results of experimental models in the clinical settings .
