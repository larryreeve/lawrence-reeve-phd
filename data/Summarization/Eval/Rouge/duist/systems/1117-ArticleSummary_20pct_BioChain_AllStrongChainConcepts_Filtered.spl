We used the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) clinical staging system to classify the stage of cancer.7 If there was disagreement about the stage ,  the case was assigned to the earlier stage. 468 patients had FIGO stage Ib or IIa disease. 343 of these patients were enrolled after they had given their informed consent to take part .
The patients were randomly assigned radical surgery (n=172) or radical radiotherapy (n=171) .
The treatments in thetable were coded so that no-one could discover treatment allocation before randomisation .
Radiotherapy included ,  external pelvic irradiation with 18 MV photon beam by the multiportal technique ,  one dose of 1820Gy at the isocentre ,  and two or more portals treated daily .
We classified complications as ,  grade 1 ,  mild symptoms not affecting the patients health and easily cured ,  grade 2 ,  symptoms that can be resolved by long-term medical therapies ,  grade 3 ,  major symptoms that require surgery or invasive procedures and affect the performance status of the patient ,  or fatal complications .
After randomisation ,  there were six protocol violations ,  two in the surgery group (one progression before operation and one refusal of any therapy after randomisation) and four in the radiotherapy group (two patients whose cancer was incorrectly staged and two with synchronous neoplasia) .
Ten patients crossed over treatment ,  one refused surgery and was irradiated ,  and nine refused radiotherapy and underwent surgery .
Adjuvant radiotherapy was done in 62 (54%) of the 114 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter of 4 cm or smaller and in 46 (84%) of 55 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm. 19 patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or less and three patients whose cervical diameter was greater than 4 cm had lymph-vascular-space involvement as the only pathological risk factor ,  these patients did not receive postoperative irradiation .
The overall and disease-free actuarial 5-year survival for all patients were 83% and 74% ,  respectively ,  and did not differ significantly between the groups (figure 2). 5-year actuarial survival stratified by cervical diameter was similar in the surgery and radiotherapy groups (diameter < 4 cm ,  87% vs 90% ,  diameter >4 cm ,  70% vs 72% ,  figure 3 ,  table 3). 5-year actuarial disease-free survival for the surgery and radiotherapy groups was 80% and 82% ,  respectively ,  for patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or smaller ,  and 63% and 57% for those with a diameter larger than 4 cm ,  the between group differences were not significant .
The two groups did not differ significantly as regards squamous histotype ,  overall 5-year survival rates were 84% in surgery-group patients and 88% in radiotherapy-group patients ,  overall disease-free survival was 76% and 78% ,  respectively .
For rates of adenocarcinoma there was a significant advantage for patients who had surgery compared with those who had radiotherapy in both overall survival (70% vs 59% ,  p=005) and disease-free survival (66% vs 47% ,  p=002) .
Overall survival for the 108 surgery-group patients who received adjuvant treatment (high-risk group) compared with the patients with surgery alone (low-risk group) or radiotherapy alone (unknown risk) is shown in figure 4 ,  .
In addition ,  among women with a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm ,  there was a significantly higher rate of pelvic relapse among those who had radiotherapy than among those who had surgery plus adjuvant irradiation (16 [70%] vs 9 [53%] ,  p=046) .
Patients who had a treatment crossover were excludedfrom the analysis because the same factors that induced the treatment crossover could have affected the subsequent morbidity .
Hydroureteronephrosis was recorded in ,  two (3%) of 61 patients who had surgery alone ,  11 (10%) of 108 patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy ,  and eight (5%) of 158 patients who had radiotherapy alone (p=01) .
Chronic neurological bladder was observed in eight (13%) patients who had surgery alone and in five (5%) patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy .
Other vesical complications (severe actinic cystitis ,  stress incontinence ,  high-pressure bladder) were recorded in two (3%) patients after surgery ,  11 (10%) after surgery plus radiotherapy ,  and in eight (5%) after radiotherapy alone .
Ileal obstruction occurred in six (5%) patients who underwent surgery plus radiotherapy and in two (1%) who received radical radiotherapy .
In the radiotherapy group ,  one patient had intestinal perforation ,  one rectovaginal fistula ,  and 12 severe proctites.Severe oedema of the legs occurred in ten (9%) patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy ,  in one (06%) patient who had radiotherapy alone ,  and in none of the patients who had surgery alone .
Abdominal hernia occurred in seven patients ,  of whom four received surgery alone and three received surgery plus radiotherapy .
Our review of the published research suggests that cure rates are similar for patients with stage-I cervical cancers who undergo surgery or radiotherapy .
Surgery also offers other advantages ,  pelvic relapses can be successfully cured by radiotherapy ,  whereas salvage surgery after primary irradiation carries a high rate of failures and severe morbidity .
Radiotherapy also avoids the risks of anaesthesia and the laparotomy scar ,  and iatrogenic mortality is rare .
Morbidity is associated with both treatment strategies ,  though the most severe complications ,  such as operative mortality ,  urological complications ,  and tissue damage from irradiation ,  have been reduced during the past 20 years .
Hydroureteronephroses ,  oedema of the lower limbs ,  various vesical complications ,  and bowel morbidity are more common and compromising in women who undergo surgery plus radiotherapy .
Clinical prognostic factors can prove useful to select those patients who should be treated primarily by irradiation ,  reserving surgery for patients who do not need adjuvant treatment .
In Italy ,  a prospective randomised trial has been under way since 1993 to assess the best adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) for high-risk patients after radical surgery for FIGO stage IbIIa cancer .
Women whose cervical diameters are larger than 4 cm should be identified before surgery so that they can benefit from tailored treatment ,  radical radiotherapy ,  with the option of concomitant radiosensitising chemotherapy to improve the local control of the disease ,  or cisplatinbased chemotherapy followed by radical surgery .
The latter approach offers the advantages of surgery ,  and the neoadjuvant chemotherapy will keep to a minimum the risk of extracervical spread of the tumour withoutcombining surgery and radiotherapy .
