Purpose .
Conclusion .
Therefore ,  our data favor an intensified treatment in similar cases .
SOFT TISSUE sarcomas represent less than 1% of all malignant tumors and derive from the mesenchymal tissues present in the whole human body .
The first generation of randomized adjuvant trials have recently been reviewed and a meta-analysis performed on the basis of updated patient records .
Study Design and Staging .
Treatment started after the completion of any local treatment and/or as soon as the wound had healed (Fig 1) .
Adjuvant Treatment .
Statistical Considerations .
The checklist with the allocated groups was sent back to the responsible physician .
The present article deals with a minimum observation time of 36 months calculated from the date of randomization of the last patient (11 of 96) .
At first observation ,  the range of the tumor diameters seems to be different between the two treatment groups .
The first cycle was administered at a dose less than or equal to 50% in one patient and less than or equal to 75% in another six patients based on nonprotocol medical decisions .
There was a subsequent slight and constant decrease in the administered doses of mainly EPI ,  which was in accordance with the predefined reduction scheme and testifies to the aggressiveness of the program .
Neutropenic fever was also mostly observed after cycles 1 ,  2 ,  and 3 (15 of 16 episodes) ,  with 9% ,  13% ,  and 11% ,  respectively ,  of the patients being admitted to hospital for IV antibiotics .
Prophylactic oral antibiotics were given in an additional eight cases .
Sixty first events (local ,  distant only ,  and synchronous distant and local) were observed overall (32 in the control arm and 28 in the treatment arm) .
Table 4 lists these events .
In four patients ,  the first event was a synchronous local relapse with metastases (one patient in the control arm and three patients in the treatment arm) .
Furthermore ,  nine patients developed metachronous relapse at a different site (three were local relapse after a metastasis and six were distant relapses after a previous local relapse) .
Additional relapses at the same site after an adequate treatment are not reported .
(Fig 3) .
As the first event ,  a total of 47 distant relapses were observed (22 single distant events in the control group and 21 in the treatment group ,  one synchronous distant and local event in the control group and three in the treatment group Table 4) .
(Table 5) .
DISCUSSION .
Adjuvant treatment of localized soft tissue sarcomas is controversial because no sufficient and convincing data are available .
Furthermore ,  a number of other points about the first-generation studies evaluated by the meta-analysis should be discussed .
The regimen used in the present study represents the highest dose-intensity ever tried in an adjuvant setting for soft tissue sarcomas .
No other acute or chronic toxicities were reported .
This P value was reached ,  and the protocol was closed .
Furthermore ,  the Rizzoli Institute had already published a positive adjuvant trial17,18 and the risk of undertreating a great number of patients was a concern .
These unfavorable aspects of our study are probably related to the selection of high-risk patients only .
The outcome results at 4 years revealed a 23% overall local relapse ,  with a trend in favor of the treatment group .
However ,  between the three different local approaches there was a trend in favor of preoperative radiation therapy (two local relapse of 24 patients in the control arm ,  8.3%) .
Moreover ,  this treatment option5,32,33 was chosen for those patients presenting with locally far-advanced disease or with disease approaching critical structures (nerves and vessels) ,  therefore a high incidence of local relapse could be foreseen .
The outcome of the untreated patient group was worse than that of previous trials .
In these studies ,  the behaviour of control groups was comparable to that observed in the present trial .
Adjuvant treatment of soft tissue sarcomas is still strongly debated35,36 ,  despite 14 published trials and one meta-analysis performed on 1,568 randomized patients .
However ,  a cure seems difficult to achieve in high-risk patients ,  in our study population ,  60% of the patients have relapsed and continue to die in both arms .
