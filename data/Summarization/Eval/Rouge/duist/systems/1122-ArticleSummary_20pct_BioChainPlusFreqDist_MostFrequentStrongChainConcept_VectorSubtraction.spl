The preferred treatment of women with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO IA2–IIA) is radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy .
The overall prognosis for patients undergoing radical hysterectomy is good ,  with reported 5-year survival rates ranging from 75 to 90% .
In an effort to determine whether the improved survival in the Memorial Hospital Phase II trial was due to the combination of chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation therapy or due to the effect of the chemotherapy alone ,  a multicenter randomized Phase III clinical trial was designed .
Following recovery from the second cycle of chemotherapy ,  patients received a course of whole pelvic radiation therapy to a dose of 45 Gy ,  delivered in 20 fractions via a four-field technique ,  patients did not receive intravaginal therapy .
In the second arm of the study ,  patients were randomized to treatment with a similar regimen of chemotherapy as described above without pelvic radiation ,  following the first two cycles of cisplatin and bleomycin ,  the patient then received the third and fourth treatment of cisplatin alone at 3-to 4-week intervals .
The null hypothesis considered that the two treatment arms ,  chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy plus radiation ,  would both result in 5-year disease-free survival of 70% .
There were 12 major protocol viola-patients received only a portion of the proscribed treatment ,  tions ,  including 7 patients who were randomized (6 to che-one patient ,  randomized to chemotherapy ,  withdrew after chemotherapy plus radiation therapy and 1 patient to chemother-experiencing an allergic bleomycin reaction during the initial chemotherapy alone) and then either refused treatment (n ?6) or were infusion of bleomycin during cycle 1 .

Overall survival and disease-free .
Among the 77 patients evaluable for response ,  5 were lost survival curves are presented in Fig. 1 .
At a median follow up of 36 months (range 4–81 months) ,  19 patients have planned dose when treatment was stopped due to a severe histologic documentation of recurrent cervical cancer .
Among patients with 3 or more risk factors ,  there was also no differ-The debate regarding the role of adjuvant therapy for paence in the disease-free survival or overall survival when tients at high risk for recurrence after radical hysterectomy compared to patients with 1–2 risk factors (Fig. 3) .
Killackey et al. reported no recurrences among 22 patients with cervical cancer at high risk after radical hysterectomy utilizing a similar treatment regimen consisting of chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation therapy .
Tattersall et al. were unable to demonstrate a difference in disease-free or overall survival in 71 patients randomized to either pelvic radiation versus chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation after radical hysterectomy for Stage IB–IIA cervical cancer .
The risk factors did not appear to be additive ,  since the disease-free and overall survival were similar when patients with 1–2 risk factors were compared to those patients with 3 or more risk factors .
The analysis of the data from the 89 patients entered is not able to document that the two treatments are equivalent ,  but must be taken to suggest that the likelihood of finding a significant difference between these two treatment modalities in a full trial of 160 patients is small .
