After radical mastectomy ,  eligible patients were prospectively randomized to receive either no further treatment or 12 monthly cycles of adjuvant CMF .
All our progress reports have consistently demonstrated that there was a significant difference in the relapse-free survival (RFS) favoring patients who received adjuvant CMF .
In fact ,  a relative shortterm adjuvant systemic treatment would spare the patients a considerable amount of toxicity .
Within 4 wk from surgery ,  patients with TI-3a breast cancer ,  histologically positive axillary nodes ,  age < 70 yr ,  and living fairly close to the Institute were allocated to receive either 12 or 6 cycles of CMF .
The dose schedule of CMF was as follows ,  cyclophosphamide (CTX) 100 mg/sq m by mouth from day 1 to day 14 ,  methotrexate (MTX) 40 mg/sq m intravenously on days 1 and 8 ,  and fluorouracil (FU) 600 mg/sq m intravenously on days 1 and 8 .
A total of 18 patients older than 65 yr (CMF 12 ,  12 ,  CMF 6 ,  6) were started on low-dose CMF (MTX 30 mg/sq m ,  FU 400 mg/sq m) .
The following systemic treatment was mainly utilized ,  patients in whom estrogen receptors were positive were subjected to hormonal manipulations (ovariectomy in premenopausal women and additive hormonal therapy ,  particularly tamoxifen ,  in postmenopausal patients) ,  combined sometimes with chemotherapy .
When estrogen receptors were negative or could not be determined ,  systemic treatment consisted of combination chemotherapy utilizing preferentially an adriamycin- containing regimen .
Prior to mastectomy ,  all patients underwent complete physical examination ,  x-ray of chest and skeleton (skull ,  spine ,  pelvis ,  upper third of femurs) ,  liver scan ,  bilateral mammography ,  hemogram ,  and biochemical tests .
It appears evident that treatment regimens were unable to significantly affect the RFS within each patient subset .
The somewhat contrasting results observed in the 6-cycle group in pre- and postmenopausal patients with 1-3 nodes (80.3% versus 66.1%) again reflect only a fictitious difference (SE ,  4.1 and 8.1 ,  respectively) .
On the contrary ,  in both treatmentand menopausal groups ,  RFS was affected by the number of involved nodes (Table 1) .
In fact ,  premenopausal patients in the 12-cycle group had a 72% 5-yr survival compared to 77.1% for women in the 6-cycle group (p = 0.20) .
Regardless of the type of treatment ,  RFS and overall survival were correlated with the presence (ER +) or absence (ER -) of estrogen receptors in the primary tumor .
By contrast ,  premenopausal women with ER + tumors had a significantly longer survival than their matches with ER- tumors (79.9% versus 67.6% ,  p = 0.03) .
However ,  in spite of the fact that frequency of objective remission was superimposable (-30%) in both ER groups regardless of treatment administered and site(s) of first involvement ,  the disease in ER + tumors had amore indolent course ,  while ER - tumors showed further progression within a few months .
Only a small subgroup of 22 patients (4.8%) refused to complete the planned program ,  and this was essentially due to negative psychologic reasons since these patients objected to being on a heavy and toxic treatment program (drug injections and timing of follow-up) without having visible disease .
The observation that in some patient subsets 6 cycles of CMF yielded apparently superior results to 12 cycles is probably related to the relative number of patients in each group and to the different median follow-up in postmenopausal women  whose accrual was discontinued in December 1976 .
Besides RFS and survival ,  other findings would support evidence that 6 cycles of CMF are as effective as 12 cycles .
In this trial ,  patients with > 4 positive axillary nodes or with a positive node in the highest axillary zone were randomized to receive cyclophosphamide and adriamycin for 5 courses (15 wk) or the same regimen given for 10 courses (30 wk) .
Henderson et al.15 reported that at 6 yr of follow-up (median 2.6 yr) ,  no RFS or survival difference was evident between the two groups .
It appears evident that ,  (A) the two series given 12 cycles of CMF achieved the same results ,  (B) the data reported in the three series treated with CMF are almost equivalent ,  (C) adjuvant CMF ,  whether administered for 12 or 6 cycles ,  was able to alter the course of operable breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes compared to the group subjected to radical mastectomy alone .
The first and most important one is that there appears to be no real difference following adjuvant chemotherapy ,  namely CMF ,  between the RFS of pre- versus postmenopausal women (CMF 12 ,  59.3% versus 57.6% ,  CMF 6 ,  66.5% versus 63.1% ,  respectively) .
More recently ,  the Guy's Hospital and Manchester study groups reported the actuarial 5-yr RFS of a randomized study comparing radical mastectomy alone versus melphalan versus CMF and showed that the only group significantly improved by adjuvant CMF was that of postmenopausal women ,  while premenopausal patients had findings that were superimposable in all three treatment groups .
A trend favoring postmenopausal versus premenopausal women given adjuvant combination chemotherapy was also observed by the NSABP group .
The results obtained in our series between ER + and ER - tumors ,  coupled with the overall findings observed in the two menopausal groups ,  further contribute to minimize the possible therapeutic role of chemotherapy-induced adjuvant castration in premenopausal women .
The fact that premenopausal women with ER + showed a significantlylonger survival than their matches with ER - tumors remains to be further evaluated .
Therefore ,  there are no sound clinical reasons to prolong treatment utilizing the same drugs beyond a 6-mo period .
Also ,  the Arizona group utilizing a different combination regimen ,  i.e. ,  adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide ,  for about 6 mo achieved a 5-yr RFS that is very similar to that observed in ourstudies .
Thus ,  from available reports it appears that different adjuvant treatments consisting of a single multidrug regimen can achieve comparable RFS results regardless of treatment duration .
Since our current results with adjuvant CMF are comparable to those utilizing a 5-drug combination or an adriamycin-containing regimen ,  clinical research efforts should now aim at improving the intrinsic limitation of a single multidrug regimen .
Our current protocols are testing sequential versus alternating delivery of CMF and adriamycin ,  since our previous experience has demonstrated that both treatments are equally effective and non-cross-resistant .
Furthermore ,  to insure full drug doses in the new protocols ,  we have modified the CMF regimen and all three drugs are administered intravenously every 3 wk (CTX and FU 600 mg/sq m ,  MTX 40 mg/sq m) .
In the presence of myelosuppression(leukocytes < 3800/cu mm and/or platelets < 100,000/cu mm) on day 22 ,  treatment is delayed 1-2 wk to allow a constant delivery of full doses .
Only long-term analysis will answer the questions of whether the addition of adjuvant hormone therapy to chemotherapy will improve the results in ER + tumors and whether the excellent results reported by the M D Anderson Hospital with FAC (fluorouracil ,  adriamycin ,  cyclophosphamide) in women with > 4 axillary nodes 7 will be reproducible .
