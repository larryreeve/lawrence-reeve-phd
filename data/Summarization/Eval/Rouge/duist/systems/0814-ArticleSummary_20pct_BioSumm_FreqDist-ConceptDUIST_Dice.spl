Loco-regional and distant relapses contribute to impair theoutcome of rectal cancer patients) As to the former ,  eitherpre- or post-operative radiation therapy (RT) significantlyreduce loco-regional recurrence ,  post-operative chemotherapy(CT) ,  alone or in different combinations with RT , is effective in improving both disease-free survival andsurvival .
From May 1992 to December 1994 ,  149 patients (80 males ,  69 females ,  age range 40-75 ,  median 64.7 years of age) with 0-2 (ECOG) performance status (PS) were enrolled by the P.A.R .
As regards haematobiochemical tests ,  patients should have WBC count at least 4000/cmm ,  PLT at least 100,000/cmm ,  bilirubin < 1.5 x N ,  AP ,  ALT ,  AST < 2.5 x N ,  creatinine < 1.25 x N .
Within 42 days from surgery ,  patients randomized in Arm I receive RT (50 Gy) in daily fractions of 2 Gy ,  5 days/wk for 5 wk ,  to tumour bed and loco-regional lymph-nodes (internal iliac and presacral nodes) with four portals (LL and AP) .
External iliac nodes are included in the radiation field if the tumour invaded bladder ,  prostate ,  cervix or vagina .
No significant differences as regards sex ,  age ,  performance states ,  type of operation (sphincter-saving resection or abdominoperineal excision of the rectum) ,  pT ,  pN stages of disease ,  number of sampled lymph-nodes ,  and grading were observed in 76 and 73 patients randomized in Arms I and II ,  respectively .
