Purpose ,  As previously shown ,  antibody treatment increased survival of patients with resected colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C .
Primary end points were overall survival and disease-free interval .
Results ,  Randomization produced balanced distribution of risk factors .
Conclusion ,  The now-matured study shows that 17-1A antibody administered after surgery prevents the development of distant metastasis in approximately one third of patients .
Patient Selection and Surgery .
Stratification and Randomization .
Protocol Management .
Protocol management has been described in detail previously .
The study performance and protocol adherence was overseen by the trial's blometncal center located at the University of Essen .
Antibody and Antigen .
The main cause of ineligibihty (12 cases) was erroneous staging .
Survival .
Recurrence .
The calculated recurrence rate was 68% (49 of 76 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  53 to 82) m the control group and 52% (47 of 90 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  39 to 67) in the 17-1A group .
Pattern of Recurrence .
Toxicity .
Immune Response to 17-1A Antibody .
DISCUSSION .
Similarly ,  the rates of reduction in mortality and recurrence ,  32% and 23% ,  respectively ,  are in alignment with the 5-year results .
For example ,  the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) conducted a study from 1977 to 1983 to compare a combination regimen that consisted of semustmine ,  folic acid ,  and fluorouracil with bacillus Calmette-Guerin .
These findings were confirmed by another cooperative group .
The dose of antibody chosen deserves a special comment .
In the planning stage of the trial ,  we were afraid of a strong anaphylactic response to repeated adnumstration of murine immunoglobulin .
Nevertheless ,  the high dose may have been critical to obtain a steep transvascular concentration gradient required for tissue penetration .
Similar high doses were used in the lymphoma trial cited earlier .
Antildiotype antibodies were detected in most HAMA-posltive samples .
Thus far ,  this assay has been negative .
However ,  it may be insufficient to determine only a humoral antiidiotype response .
It is safe to assume that antigenic heterogeneity ,  a likely consequence of the marked genomic instability of human epithelial tumors ,  will be a major obstacle for single-antibody treatments ,  as well as for any other form of monotherapy .
They do not only possess extended serum half-lives ,  but also harness human effector mechanisms much more efficiently than murine immunoglobulihns can do .
Direct tumoricidal effects are good candidates for the still controversial reaction mechanism of unconjugated antibodies .
