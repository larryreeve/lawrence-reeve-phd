Purpose ,  As previously shown ,  antibody treatment increased survival of patients with resected colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C .
Conclusion ,  The now-matured study shows that 17-1A antibody administered after surgery prevents the development of distant metastasis in approximately one third of patients .
Therefore ,  with no effect of antibody therapy on the local relapse at 5 years ,  It was of interest to know how the overall survival evolved at the 7-year follow-up evaluation .
Recurrence was defined as time from date of surgery to date of first objective evidence of an abnormal diagnostic finding .
Therefore ,  it is now named eplthehal cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) .
Since ineligibility was not biased by treatment assignment ,  these patients were excluded from further analysis .
However ,  eleven patients who refused their treatment assignment were considered eligible and were included in all statistical analyses as participants in the treatment group .
Survival .
After 7 years ,  a total of 87 deaths were observed in 166 eligible patients .
The death rate of the observed group was 63% (48 of 76 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  48 to 78) of patients and that of the treated group was 43% (39 of 90 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  31 to 58) .
Thus ,  treatment with antibody led to a relative reduction of mortality by 32% (hazards ratio ,  0.57 ,  95% confidence interval ,  8% to 51%) .
The KaplanMeier survival curves (Fig 1A) showed a significant benefit for patients who received antibody over those who did not receive treatment (P < .01 with Cox's proportional hazard model corrected for influence of prognostic variables ,  and P = .01 with log-rank test for the univariate analysis) .
Recurrence .
The calculated recurrence rate was 68% (49 of 76 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  53 to 82) m the control group and 52% (47 of 90 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  39 to 67) in the 17-1A group .
Antibody treatment increased time to recurrence (P = .04 with Cox proportional hazards model corrected for influence of prognostic variables ,  and P = .07 with log-rank test for umvanate analysis) .
In this analysis ,  data on patients who died without recurrence were censored .
Pattern of Recurrence .
Therefore ,  the proposition is holding up that treatment with 17-1A may preferentially act on isolated tumor cells and thus prevent outgrowth of distant metastases .
Immune Response to 17-1A Antibody .
When tested for antibody response against murine antibody (HAMA) ,  80% of treated patients developed a distinct HAMA response after the second or third nfusion .
DISCUSSION .
As the 7-year median follow-up data confirm the previously reported 5-year findings ,  the conclusion seems warranted that antibody treatment improves the chances of curatively operated patients .
The conclusion seems warranted that some of the treated patients ,  who have not yet recurred ,  may indeed be cured .
The conspicuous inefficacy of the antibody on local recurrences (Fig 4) may account for the smaller P values in the disease-free-interval analysis .
Local recurrences may not affect the overall survival curve to the same degree as distant metastases do (Fig 3) ,  therefore ,  survival at 7 years appears to be superior to the disease-free interval .
These findings were confirmed by another cooperative group .
Patients in the control group continued to die of progressive disease that probably had arisen from occult distant metastatic cells that were elimnated by the antibody in the treatment group .
In the planning stage of the trial ,  we were afraid of a strong anaphylactic response to repeated adnumstration of murine immunoglobulin .
Thus far ,  this assay has been negative .
Thus far ,  in murine systems ,  breaking of tolerance against autoantigens via the antildotype route has not yet been shown in an unambiguous fashion .
They do not only possess extended serum half-lives ,  but also harness human effector mechanisms much more efficiently than murine immunoglobulihns can do .
