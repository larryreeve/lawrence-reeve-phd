Cisplatin is said to be the most active anticancer drug in cervical cancer ,  although 100 mg/m did not significantly improve the complete response (CR) rate compared prospectively with 50 mg/m (12.7 v 10% ,  respectively) and there was no appreciable difference in response duration ,  progression-free interval (PFI) ,  or survival.Thus ,  there is no convincing reason to use a cisplatindose higher than 50 mg/m .
Nevertheless ,  the possibility existed that the combination ,  with two CRs and five PRs (39% response rate) ,  produced improved results .
A pilot study used mitolactol plus cisplatin and established a tolerable dose schedule of 180 mg/m of mitolactoldaily for 5 days with cisplatin 50 mg/m .
Although an intermediate dose level (50 mg/m cisplatin and 225mg/m mitolactol daily for 5 days) was considered ,  it wasnot pursued ,  since six of 10 patients at the first dose level in the pilot study required dose reductions and/or delays with re-treatment .
Ifosfamide is a new agent closely related to cyclophosphamide ,  but with less marrow toxicity and more bladder toxicity that requires concomitant use of the uroprotectormesna .
Treatment of cervix cancer with the combination of ifosfamide ,  cisplatin ,  and bleomycin yielded a 69% response rate (49 patients) in one series .
The result was impressive ,  but the importance of bleomycin was unclear and its toxicity sometimes troublesome ,  so we proposed to compare cisplatin alone versus a regimen of cisplatinplus mitolactol (C + M) and a regimen of cisplatin plusifosfamide (and mesna) (CIFX) .
Measurements by computed tomography (CT) scan were accepted if the lesion was > 3 cm and sharply defined .
However ,  shortly after activation ,  the study was amended so that the serum creatinine concentration was to be within the institution's normal limits and the serum albumin level was to be >= 3 g/dL .
Ineligible patients included those with cervical neoplasms other than squamous cell carcinoma or with nonmeasurable cervical cancer ,  WBC count less than 4,000/uL and/or platelet count less than 100,000/uL ,  abnormal liver function (bilirubin ,  AST ,  or alkaline phosphatase level > two times normal not related to the cancer) , bilateral hydronephrosis ,  GOG PS 3 or 4 ,  past or concomitant malignancy other than skin (excluding melanoma) ,  prior therapy with cytotoxic drugs except when used as a radiation sensitizer ,  radiationtherapy within 3 weeks of entry ,  lesions measurable only by ultrasound ,  or pregnancy or lactation .
Patients were prospectively stratified according to whether they had received prior radiation-sensitizer treatment (hydroxyurea ,  cisplatin , or fluorouracil) and by PS ,  and were then centrally randomized with equal probability to receive (1) cisplatin 50 mg/m with appropriate hydration every 3 weeks for a maximum of six courses ,  or (2) cisplatin 50 mg/m on day 1 plus mitolactol (180 mg/m orally for 5 days) on days 2 through 6 every 3 weeks ,  or (3) cisplatin 50mg/m plus ifosfamide 5.0 g/m over 24 hours plus mesna 6 g/m given concurrently with ifosfamide and for 12 hours after ,  every 3 weeks ,  again for a maximum of six courses .
No subsequent treatment course was to begin until the WBC count was greater than 4,000/uL and the platelet count 100,000uL .
Dose adjustments were specified for hematologic ,  gastrointestinal ,  renal ,  and neurologic toxicity .
The null hypothesis was rejected if the probability of the observed result ,  or a more extreme result ,  under the null hypothesis was less than 0.025 (one-tail test).A linear logistic model was used to adjust for age ,  PS ,  and whether cisplatin had been used as a radiosensitizer .
Ten patients did not receive the randomized study treatment .
Between June 1990 and January 1994 ,  454 women entered the study of whom 16 were ineligible (wrong stage ,  n = 2 ,  wrong cell type ,  n = 9 ,  wrong primary tumor ,  n = 2 ,  prior chemotherapy ,  n = 2 ,  second primary tumor ,  n = 1) ,  which left 438 eligible patients (including 10 who received no drug ,  all were included in the intent to-treat analysis) .
PFS (Fig 1) adjusted for age ,  PS ,  and prior cisplatinas a radiosensitizer was statistically significantly longer for CIFX (median ,  4.6 v 3.2 months) compared with cisplatin alone (P = .003) ,  however ,  there was no difference between C + M and cisplatin alone .
Chemotherapy concurrently with definitive radiation therapy as a radiosensitizer has been used in some cases of cervix cancer in recent years .
The treatment arms were well balanced in this regard and there was no evidence that the treatment comparisons were distorted by this prior treatment .
The results of this trial in cervix cancer reflect a common set of findings in combination chemotherapy of advanced solid tumors ,  namely ,  a higher response rate (but not a high CR rate) with a combination compared with single-agent therapy at the cost of more toxicity and no survival benefit .
Since the role of bleomycin in cervix cancer is unclear ,  but implies restricting therapy to patients with good pulmonary function ,  we elected not to include bleomycinin the present study .
One of the earlier GOG trials showed an improved overall response rate (31.4% v 20.7% ,  P = .015) with double-dose cisplatin (100 mg/m2) ,  but no improvement in CR rate ,  PFI ,  or survival .
