OF the estimated 13700 women in the United States in whom invasive cervical cancer was diagnosed in 1998 nearly 5000 will ultimately die of the disease because of the inadequacies of current treatment .
In the United States cervical cancer disproportionately affects women who are members of minority groups and women of low socioeconomic status partly because such women tend to have insufficient access to and knowledge of screening programs for cervical cancer .
The nationwide use of such screening programs has greatly reduced the incidence of invasive cervical cancer .
Women with early cervical cancer can be successfully treated with radical surgery .
To eradicate micrometastases and sensitize tumor cells to radiation several studies have explored the use of radiotherapy with concomitant chemotherapy .
The results of these studies are inconclusive and have been criticized because they lacked a comparison group treated with radiation alone and because the radiation therapy used may have been deficient according to current standards .
In 1990 the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group RTOG began a randomized clinical trial to compare the effects on survival of treatment with extended-field radiation and treatment with pelvic radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in patients with cervical cancer .
We report the first results of this study .
METHODS .
Para-aortic lymph nodes were evaluated by bipedal lymphangiography or retroperitoneal surgical exploration .
The first intracavitary treatment was performed before or during external-beam radiotherapy and additional external-beam therapy was delivered with a midline block .
To avoid treatment delays intracavitary insertions were performed without chemotherapy if a patient had a granulocyte count of less than 1500 per cubic millimeter and a platelet count of less than 100000 per cubic millimeter .
Statistical Analysis .
Overall survival was the primary end point for the comparison of the two treatments and was calculated from the date of study entry until the date of death or the date of the last follow-up visit .
Death from any cause was considered a failure in the analysis .
The KaplanMeier method was used to calculate both survival rates .
Log-rank tests were used to compare treatments .
Five-year rates of secondary end points such as locoregional recurrence para-aortic recurrence and distant metastasis were estimated with the use of cumulative-incidence methods and treatment effects were tested with use of the Gray algorithm .
On the basis of the results of two earlier RTOG trials we predicted that the five-year survival rate for the control group radiotherapy alone would be 65 percent for patients with stage IB or II disease and 40 percent for patients with stage III or IVA disease .
We estimated that 40 to 70 percent of the patients would have stage IB or II disease .
A 33 percent reduction in the death rate as a result of chemotherapy would yield an absolute improvement of approximately 10 percent in the five-year survival rate .
Interim analyses were scheduled to occur when 50 percent of the patients had been enrolled and when the enrollment goal was met .
The characteristics of the two treatment groups are summarized in Table 2. Follow-up data were available for 193 of the 195 patients in the combined-therapy group and for all 193 patients in the radiotherapy group .
KaplanMeier analysis revealed that overall survival rates were significantly better among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy than among those treated with radiotherapy alone 73 percent vs. 58 percent P0.004 Table 5 and Fig. 1. The estimated five-year survival rates according to various stratification variables are summarized in Table 5. There was no significant difference in overall survival between treatment groups among patients who had stage III or IVA disease although the study was not designed to have a sufficient number of patients in these subgroups to test for a statistically significant difference .
Reports by Rose et al .
and Keys et al .
in this issue of the Journal strengthen the body of evidence supporting the use of combined therapy in women with advanced cervical cancer .
The role of extended-field radiation with chemotherapy must also be defined .
