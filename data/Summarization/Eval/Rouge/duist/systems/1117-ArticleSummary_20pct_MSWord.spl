468 patients had FIGO stage Ib or IIa disease .
The patients were randomly assigned radical surgery (n=172) or radical radiotherapy (n=171) .
Patients were also stratified by cervical diameter ( 4 cm or >4 cm) .
Ten patients crossed over treatment: one refused surgery and was irradiated ,  and nine refused radiotherapy and underwent surgery .
Five patients in the radiotherapy group did not receive brachyradiotherapy after external irradiation because of unfavourable anatomy and subsequently underwent radical surgery .
Thus ,  169 in the surgery group and 158 in the radiotherapy group underwent the scheduled treatment (compliance of 98% for surgery and 92% for radiotherapy) .
The mean age of patients in the radiotherapy group was slightly greater than that of patients in the surgery group .
Lymphangiography revealed positive nodes in 24 (14%) surgery-group patients and in 22 (13%) radiotherapy group patients .
Six of the 24 surgery-group patients showed no lymph-node metastasis in the surgical specimen .
Adjuvant radiotherapy was done in 62 (54%) of the 114 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter of 4 cm or smaller and in 46 (84%) of 55 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm. 19 patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or less and three patients whose cervical diameter was greater than 4 cm had lymph-vascular-space involvement as the only pathological risk factor; these patients did not receive postoperative irradiation .
Survival and recurrence 5-year actuarial survival stratified by cervical diameter was similar in the surgery and radiotherapy groups (diameter < 4 cm: 87% vs 90%; diameter >4 cm: 70% vs 72%; figure 3 ,  table 3) .
The two groups did not differ significantly as regards squamous histotype: overall 5-year survival rates were 84% in surgery-group patients and 88% in radiotherapy-group patients; overall disease-free survival was 76% and 78% ,  respectively .
Overall ,  86 (25•5%) patients developed recurrent disease: 42 (25%) in the surgery group and 44 (26%) in the radiotherapy group .
Of these 86 patients ,  60 (70%) died of disease .
Among the patients who developed recurrent disease ,  six (14%) in the surgery group and 13 (30%) in the radiotherapy group were cured; this difference was not significant (p=0•15) .
Complications Complications were classified according to the glossary of Chassagne and colleagues.10 In the surgery group ,  48 (28%) patients showed severe (grade 2–3) morbidity that required medical or surgical treatment ,  compared with 19 (12%) patients in the radiotherapy group ,  (p=0•0004; table 3) .
Grade 2 or 3 complications affected 19 (31%) patients who had surgery alone and 29 (27%) patients who received surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy (p=0•71) .
Hydroureteronephrosis was recorded in: two (3%) of 61 patients who had surgery alone; 11 (10%) of 108 patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy; and eight (5%) of 158 patients who had radiotherapy alone (p=0•1) .
The relative risk of this complication for surgery plus radiotherapy versus surgery alone was 3•11 (95% CI 0•71–13•56) and was 2•01 (95% CI 0•84–4•8%) for surgery plus radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone .
Chronic neurological bladder was observed in eight (13%) patients who had surgery alone and in five (5%) patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy .
Other vesical complications (severe actinic cystitis ,  stress incontinence ,  high-pressure bladder) were recorded in two (3%) patients after surgery ,  11 (10%) after surgery plus radiotherapy ,  and in eight (5%) after radiotherapy alone .
Ileal obstruction occurred in six (5%) patients who underwent surgery plus radiotherapy and in two (1%) who received radical radiotherapy .
In the radiotherapy group ,  one patient had intestinal perforation ,  one rectovaginal fistula ,  and 12 severe proctites .
Severe oedema of the legs occurred in ten (9%) patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy ,  in one (0•6%) patient who had radiotherapy alone ,  and in none of the patients who had surgery alone .
Pelvic lymphocyst occurred in five (8%) patients after surgery and in five (15%) after surgery plus radiotherapy .
Abdominal hernia occurred in seven patients ,  of whom four received surgery alone and three received surgery plus radiotherapy .
Complications after radiotherapy arise later than after surgery ,  although radiotherapy-related complications are often permanent .
Adjuvant radiotherapy was prospectively planned in patients at high risk of relapse .
Most women with stage Ib–IIa cervical cancer can be treated successfully with radiotherapy ,  whereas a judicious selection of patients is necessary before planning primary radical surgery .
combining surgery and radiotherapy .
