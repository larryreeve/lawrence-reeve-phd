Patients with clinical Stage IB–IIA cancer of the uterine cervix treated by radical hysterectomy ,  bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy ,  and aortic lymph node sampling were eligible for entry into this prospective study if they had one or more of the following risk factors ,  (1) metastatic disease to pelvic lymph nodes ,  (2) large primary tumors greater than or equal to 4 cm in diameter ,  (3) deeply invasive lesions with 75% or greater stromal invasion ,  (4) nonsquamous histology ,  and/or (5) occult parametrial involvement or positive surgical margins .
Following recovery from the second cycle of chemotherapy ,  patients received a course of whole pelvic radiation therapy to a dose of 45 Gy ,  delivered in 20 fractions via a four-field technique ,  patients did not receive intravaginal therapy .
In the second arm of the study ,  patients were randomized to treatment with a similar regimen of chemotherapy as described above without pelvic radiation ,  following the first two cycles of cisplatin and bleomycin ,  the patient then received the third and fourth treatment of cisplatin alone at 3-to 4-week intervals .
Twenty-five patients had 3 or more high70 years .
Seventy-five patients had a Stage IB cervical cancer risk factors and 64 had 1 to 2 risk factors ,  33 of these patients and the remaining 14 patients had a Stage IIA cancer .
Additional histopathologic features of the patients met the entry criteria for surgical procedures and had patients are presented in Table 1 .
Forty-five patients were randomized to the chemotherapy withdrawn by the institutional principal investigator due to plus radiation therapy treatment arm and 44 patients received poor medical condition of the patient (n ? 1) .

Tattersall et al. were unable to demonstrate a difference in disease-free or overall survival in 71 patients randomized to either pelvic radiation versus chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation after radical hysterectomy for Stage IB–IIA cervical cancer .
The risk factors did not appear to be additive ,  since the disease-free and overall survival were similar when patients with 1–2 risk factors were compared to those patients with 3 or more risk factors .
Additionally ,  if the patient does experience a local or regional recurrence after chemotherapy ,  pelvic radiation therapy still has curative potential .
