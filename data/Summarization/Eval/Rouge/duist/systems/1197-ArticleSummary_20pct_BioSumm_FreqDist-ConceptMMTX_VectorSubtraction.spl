Purpose .
Results .
After a median follow-up of 59 months ,  60 patients had relapsed and 48 died (28 and 20 in the treatment arm and 32 and 28 in the control arm ,  respectively) .
Conclusion .
Therefore ,  our data favor an intensified treatment in similar cases .
SOFT TISSUE sarcomas represent less than 1% of all malignant tumors and derive from the mesenchymal tissues present in the whole human body .
Treatment started after the completion of any local treatment and/or as soon as the wound had healed (Fig 1) .
Selection Criteria .
Local Treatment .
Adjuvant Treatment .
Toxicities were graded according to World Health Organization criteria .
On the basis of the estimated proportions of patients free from metastatic disease 2 years after diagnosis (60% in the treated group v 40% in the control group) ,  it was estimated that 95 patients were required per arm (beta = 0.80 ,  alpha = 0.05) .
The checklist with the allocated groups was sent back to the responsible physician .
RESULTS .
The present article deals with a minimum observation time of 36 months calculated from the date of randomization of the last patient (11 of 96) .
At first observation ,  the range of the tumor diameters seems to be different between the two treatment groups .
Local Treatment .
Seven patients (13%) did not start adjuvant treatment .
The first cycle was administered at a dose less than or equal to 50% in one patient and less than or equal to 75% in another six patients based on nonprotocol medical decisions .
Neutropenic fever was also mostly observed after cycles 1 ,  2 ,  and 3 (15 of 16 episodes) ,  with 9% ,  13% ,  and 11% ,  respectively ,  of the patients being admitted to hospital for IV antibiotics .
Follow-Up Data .
Sixty first events (local ,  distant only ,  and synchronous distant and local) were observed overall (32 in the control arm and 28 in the treatment arm) .
Table 4 lists these events .
(Fig 3) .
(Table 5) .
Overall ,  the difference in distant relapses as the first event between the two arms was not significant (P = .48 ,  Fig 3) .
OS .
Patients died from uncontrolled metastatic disease .
One patient in the control group died without evidence of disease at 28 months and was considered as censored for overall survival .
Adjuvant treatment of localized soft tissue sarcomas is controversial because no sufficient and convincing data are available .
Furthermore ,  a number of other points about the first-generation studies evaluated by the meta-analysis should be discussed .
No other acute or chronic toxicities were reported .
However ,  only high-risk patients were selected for this study .
These unfavorable aspects of our study are probably related to the selection of high-risk patients only .
Moreover ,  this treatment option5,32,33 was chosen for those patients presenting with locally far-advanced disease or with disease approaching critical structures (nerves and vessels) ,  therefore a high incidence of local relapse could be foreseen .
The outcome of the untreated patient group was worse than that of previous trials .
The present trial deals with data obtained at a median follow-up time of 59 months and 36 months after last randomization .
Adjuvant treatment of soft tissue sarcomas is still strongly debated35,36 ,  despite 14 published trials and one meta-analysis performed on 1,568 randomized patients .
However ,  a cure seems difficult to achieve in high-risk patients ,  in our study population ,  60% of the patients have relapsed and continue to die in both arms .
