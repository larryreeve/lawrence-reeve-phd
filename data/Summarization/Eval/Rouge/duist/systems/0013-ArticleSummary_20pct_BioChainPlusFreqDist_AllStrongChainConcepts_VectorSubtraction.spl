ALTHOUGH MANY PATIENTS with carcinoma of the uterine cervix are cured with local measures ,  a substantial minority recur or present with metastases and are potential candidates for systemic therapy .
Since both drugs have activityin cervical cancer ,  it seemed reasonable to evaluate this combination .
The combination of DAG and cisplatin has previously been studied .
Nevertheless ,  the possibility existed that the combination ,  with two CRs and five PRs (39% response rate) ,  produced improved results .
Originally ,  the protocol was less stringent about renal function and had no specification about serum albumin level .
The use of lorazepam was discouraged in such patients in order not to mask the possible neurotoxicity of ifosfamide .
Dose adjustments were specified for hematologic ,  gastrointestinal ,  renal ,  and neurologic toxicity .
Toxicity was graded according to standard cooperative group criteria .
The design for this study was based on the assumption that a 15% increase in the response rate due to the addition of either mitolactolor ifosfamide to cisplatin would be regarded as clinically meaningful .
The adjusted relative risk of survival and progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed with a linear proportional hazards model .
RESULTS .
Toxicity .
There was more granulocytopenia ,  thrombocytopenia , and leukocytopenia associated with C + M compared with cisplatin alone (P < .025) .
Also ,  more granulocytopenia ,  thrombocytopenia ,  and nausea and vomiting were associated with CIFX versus cisplatin alone (P < .025)(Table 2) .
In all cases except one fatal case ,  CNS toxicity was reversible .
The frequency of response among those treated with C + M (21.1%) was only slightly greater than cisplatin and not statistically significant .
There was no significant difference in survival between cisplatin and either of the combination regimens (median[months] ,  cisplatin ,  8.0 ,  C + M ,  7.3 ,  CIFX ,  8.3 ,  P =.835) (Fig 2) .
It remains to be seen whether the addition of bleomycin will be helpful ,  that is the subject of a current randomized trial .
The pilot study on which the C +M arm of the present trial was based identified 180 mg/m for 5 days as the maximum-tolerated dose in combination with cisplatin .
Perhaps that dose of mitolactol is too low to provide an additional effect with cisplatin .
Perhaps this is a step in the right direction ,  albeit with more toxicity .
In fact ,  this appears to be the first evidence of an impact of a chemotherapy regimen on PFS in advanced cervix cancer .
