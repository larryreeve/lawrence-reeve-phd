Introduction .
Rectal cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases with 11 500 cases diagnosed in the UK in 1994 alone .
Little change has been seen in survival rates ,  which remain at about 40% at 5 years from diagnosis .
The aim was to increase the number of patients in whom curative resection could be done ,  and so improve survival rates .
Two parallel opposed fields 18 cm by 15 cm were positioned to cover the tumour with an adequate proximal margin (normally 5 cm). 20 daily fractions of 2 Gy at the mid-plane central axis of the volume of the tumour were given over 4 weeks .
Statistical analysis .
Based on accrual to the previous MRC preoperative radiotherapy trial ,  we expected that this number would be accrued in 4 to 5 years .
Proportions were compared by the  2 test ,  and ordered categorical data by the Mann-Whitney test .
Recruitment ,  initially steady ,  declined after publication ,  and perhaps misinterpretation ,  of the disappointing results of the first MRC trial of low-dose radiotherapy .
After 7 years of accrual ,  only slightly more than half the required number of patients had been entered .
Of the 279 patients ,  217 died .
Only four (3%) patients complained of nausea and 3 (2%) of abdominal pain .
There was no evidence of an excess of complications in the radiotherapy group .
Tumours were significantly smaller in the radiotherapy group (Mann-Whitney ,  p.0.0001) .
However ,  the number of lymph nodes examined was lower in the radiotherapy group .
However ,  the data are compatible with a reduction in the risk of as much as a half or as little as 2% .
Consistent with the results of the individual endpoints ,  results for disease-free survival also suggest a benefit to the radiotherapy patients (hazard ratio 0.76 [0.58-1.0] ,  log-rank p=0.05) .
However ,  the 95% CI for this hazard ratio is wide (0.6-1.04) indicating that the data are also compatible with no advantage to radiotherapy (figure 3) .
Necropsy was done rarely and so causes of death should be interpreted with caution .
Discussion .
There was evidence of benefit from preoperative radiotherapy before the trial .
This reluctance may have hindered recruitment to the trial .
In addition ,  the patients selected for this study represent only a small proportion of total operable cases .
None of these studies has concentrated specifically on locally advanced tumours .
