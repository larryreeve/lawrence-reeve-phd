Colorectal cancer is one of the most common adult malignant tumours affecting one person in twenty in the USA and in most developed countries .
Although 40-50 patients may be cured with surgery many will develop metastatic disease .
For these patients treatment with fluorouracil usually modulated by folinic acid is the only option and the median survival is 10-12 months .
Because cytotoxic agents have low response rates and can be associated with severe side-effects many patients receive supportive care .
In first-line chemotherapy fluorouracil with folinic-acid is better than supportive care or delayed chemotherapy for survival and quality of life but the value of second-line chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer has not yet been proven .
In phase II studies irinotecan has objective antitumour activity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer even in those with documented fluorouracil-resistant tumours with response rates of 11.23. The trial we report was started in 1995 to compare irinotecan with supportive care alone for survival quality of life and other clinical variables .
In the supportive-care alone group patients were given best supportive care and were seen every 3 weeks .
After discontinuation of treatment in the irinotecan group patients were regularly assessed as in the supportive care group tumour status symptoms or side-effects every 3 weeks until death or for at least a year .
After discontinuation of treatment in the irinotecan group patients continued to fill in QLQ-C30 questionnaires every 6 weeks as in the supportive-care group .
With p0.05 and power of 0.80 264 patients were required 176 in the irinotecan group and 88 in the supportive-care group to show a significant difference in 1-year survival from 20 supportive care to 35 irinotecan .
Patients' data .
189 patients were randomly allocated irinotecan and supportive care and 90 patients were allocated supportive care alone figure 1. These characteristics were similar for both groups except for performance status more patients having poor performance status in the supportive-care group were assessed by carcinoembryonic antigen only with mean antigen ratios versus reference values of 2.24 and 2.83 respectively .
Irinotecan was given for a median of 4.1 0.7-12.6 months and 172 91 patients received their first infusion within 8 days of randomisation .
40 21 patients in the irinotecan group received subsequent anticancer chemotherapies 31 a fluorouracil regimen nine a drug other than irinotecan .
In the supportive- care group 28 31 of patients received chemotherapy 21 a fluorouracil regimen nine other drugs and one irinotecan .
17 19 patients in the supportive-care group received chemotherapy within 1 month of randomisation compared with two 1 in the irinotecan group .
This benefit appeared after 2 months and became more apparent throughout the study period .
1-year survival was 36.2 and 13.8 in the irinotecan and supportive-care groups respectively .
With a performance status of two there were 24 92 events in the irinotecan group median duration of which was 5.1 range 0.3-18.5 months .
Pain-free survival in patients without pain at baseline figure 4 was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the supportive-care group p0.003 despite a higher proportion of patients on opioids in the supportive-care group .
In the supportive-care group there were 26 79 events median duration 2.0 0.13.0 months .
Within 23 weeks of randomisation the rate of patients with opioid consumption by 3-week blocks ranged from 25 to 34 in the irinotecan group and from 40 to 56 in the supportive-care group .
The univariate analyses of variance were significantly in favour of the irinotecan group for the cognitive functioning score p.0.001 the global quality-of-life score p 0.001 the pain score p0.008 dyspnoea p0.04 appetite loss p 0.002 and financial-impact scores p 0.001. Patients on supportive-care alone experienced a high incidence of severe adverse events especially pain and asthenia although significantly more patients in the irinotecan group experienced severe events especially neutropenia nausea vomiting and diarrhoea .
Admission for adverse events occurred in 136 72 of patients in the irinotecan group and 57 63 of patients in the supportive-carealone group for a cumulative median of 15 range 1.168 days and 11 2.87 days respectively .
This study showed that treatment with irinotecan and supportive care alone compared with supportive care prolonged the life of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer .
This benefit was clinically meaningful because the probability of surviving 1 year was 2.6 times greater in patients given irinotecan compared with that of patients given supportive care alone .
Other efficacy endpoints such as survival without weight loss survival without performance status deterioration pain-free survival and quality-of-life were all significantly in favour of irinotecan .
