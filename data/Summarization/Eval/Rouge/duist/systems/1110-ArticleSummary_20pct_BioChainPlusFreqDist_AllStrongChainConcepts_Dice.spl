A previous study reported improved survival among women with locally advanced cervical cancer who received prophylactic radiation to the para-aortic nodes .
Women with a Karnofsky performance score of at least 60 and blood counts and serum levels of blood urea nitrogen ,  creatinine ,  and bilirubin that were within normal ranges were eligible for the study .
The initial evaluation also included chest radiography ,  cystoscopy ,  proctoscopy ,  a complete blood count ,  and measurement of liver and renal function .
External-beam radiation was delivered with anteroposterior and posteroanterior opposed beams of at least 15-MV photons or the use of four fields (anteroposterior ,  posteroanterior ,  and two lateral fields) of at least 4-MV photons .
The first intracavitary treatment was performed before or during external-beam radiotherapy ,  and additional external-beam therapy was delivered with a midline block .
The suggested maximal doses to the bladder ,  the rectum ,  and the lateral surface of the vagina were 75 ,  70 ,  and 130 Gy ,  respectively .
Once treatment ended ,  patients were evaluated every three months for the first two years ,  every four months during the third year ,  every six months during the fourth and fifth years ,  and then annually .
Toxicity was assessed at the time of each evaluation with use of the Cooperative Group Common Toxicity Criteria ,  the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria ,  and the Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme of the RTOG and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer .
Five-year rates of secondary end points such as locoregional recurrence ,  para-aortic recurrence ,  and distant metastasis were estimated with the use of cumulative-incidence methods , and treatment effects were tested with use of the Gray algorithm .
Acute side effects of treatment were defined as those that occurred within 60 days after the completion of radiotherapy ,  and late effects were defined as those occurring or persisting more than 60 days after radiotherapy .
The study was initially designed to be able to detect a reduction of 33 percent in the annual death rate ,  with a statistical power of 80 percent and a two-sided significance level of 0.05 .
On the basis of the results of two earlier RTOG trials ,  we predicted that the five-year survival rate for the control group (radiotherapy alone) would be 65 percent for patients with stage IB or II disease and 40 percent for patients with stage III or IVA disease .
A 33 percent reduction in the death rate as a result of chemotherapy would yield an absolute improvement of approximately 10 percent in the five-year survival rate .
The nominal significance level required for early reporting was origioriginally set at P=0.005 ,  but we subsequently adopted a more conservative approach ,  because it allowed the number of deaths observed to determine the nominal level required for early reporting .
Fifteen patients (4 percent) — six in the combined-therapy group and nine in the radiotherapy group — were subsequently disqualified because of failure to undergo the required evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (eight patients) ,  the presence of extrapelvic cancer (two) ,  the presence of a rare histologic subtype (one) ,  the presence of a stage IB1 tumor with no involvement of pelvic nodes (one) ,  the absence of pretreatment data (two) ,  and receipt of chemotherapy before radiotherapy (one) .
Major but acceptable treatment deviations occurred in another 1 percent and 9 percent of these groups ,  respectively .
Eleven patients (3 percent) did not undergo brachytherapy ,  three patients refused ,  and eight patients did not undergo it for other reasons .
The median total duration of radiation was 58 days ,  with a mean dose of 89 Gy delivered to point A in each group .
Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that overall survival rates were significantly better among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy than among those treated with radiotherapy alone (73 percent vs. 58 percent ,  P=0.004) (Table 5 and Fig. 1) .
The relative likelihood of disease-free survival in the combined-therapy group ,  as compared with the radiotherapy group ,  was 0.48 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.35 to 0.66) .
There was no significant difference in overall survival between treatment groups among patients who had stage III or IVA disease ,  although  the study was not designed to have a sufficient number of patients in these subgroups to test for a statistically significant difference .
For patients with stage III or IVA disease ,  the five-year disease-free survival rates were 58 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 38 percent in the radiotherapy group (P=0.13) .
Although chemotherapy  increased the hematologic toxicity ,  this effect was reversible and the incidence of late side effects was similar in the two treatment groups .
Although the group reported significant improvements in overall and disease-free survival with the addition of hydroxyurea therapy ,  the study has been criticized for the use of a low dose of radiation and the poor survival rates in both groups and because more than half of the 190 patients who were enrolled could not be evaluated .
The results of the Patterns of Care studies and large retrospective analyses suggest that these features correlate with survival rates and rates of local control of cervical cancer .
We also used a somewhat more aggressive regimen of chemotherapy than have other groups .
We used a higher dose of cisplatin (75 mg per square meter) than that used with fluorouracil in the Gynecologic Oncology Group studies ,  and we also included a third cycle of chemotherapy during one of the intracavitary procedures .
Future studies will continue to evaluate cisplatin and fluorouracil as well as other drugs to determine the most effective doses and routes of administration .
In our study ,  the benefit of para-aortic radiation may have been less than that observed in an earlier RTOG trial ,  because our trial required more rigorous staging of para-aortic lymph nodes and included patients with more advanced pelvic disease .
