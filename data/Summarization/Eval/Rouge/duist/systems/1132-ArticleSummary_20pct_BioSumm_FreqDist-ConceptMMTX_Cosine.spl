While surgery and radiotherapy (RT) are equally effective in early-stage disease ,  radiation  therapy has been the primary treatment modality for stage III disease ,  with 5-year survival rates between 30% to 45% being  reported.4-8 Attempts to improve these results ,  including the use of hypoxic cell sensitizers ,  hyperbaric oxygen therapy , '0  and neutron therapy" have met with limited or no success .
Vogl et al and Alberts et al using a combination of bleomycin ,  vincristine ,   mitomycin ,  and cisplatin (BOMP) in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent disease reported high response rates (> 20% of  the patients with a complete response [CR]) with acceptable toxicity .
To test this  hypothesis ,  we began in 1984 at the Instituto Nacional de Cancer (Rio de Janeiro ,  Brazil) a prospective randomized trial  comparing neoadjuvant BOMP CT followed by pelvic RT (CT + RT) versus pelvic RT alone in patients with stage IIIB carcinoma of  the cervix .
Patients also needed to have adequate medullary reserve (WBC Å½ 4,000/IpL ,  platelet count >  100,000/p.L) and normal renal (BUN < 8.9 mmol/L ,  creatinine < 130 Rimol/L ,  creatinine clearance > 1.17 mL/s) and liver  (alkaline phosphatase < 110 U/L ,  bilirubin < 21 pimol/L) function .
In  the CT + RT group ,  11 refused further therapy ,  including pelvic RT ,  after only one cycle of CT ,  and two others were found to  have abnormal renal function after randomization and before commencement of treatment .
Chemotherapy consisted of bleomycin 15 U intramuscularly (IM) every 12 hours from days 1 to 4 (total dose ,  120 U) ,   vincristine 1 mg/m2 IV on day 1 ,  mitomycin 10 mg/im 2 IV on day 1 ,  and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1 ,  given on an outpatient  basis every 3 weeks for three cycles .
Potassium chloride at 20 mEq/L and magnesium sulfate were added as needed .
Six months after activation of the study ,  after nine patients had been treated with CT ,  the bleomycin dose was reduced to 15  U IM every 12 hours from day 1 to day 3 (total dose ,  90 U) ,  and after the first year ,  cisplatin administration was changed  from day 1 to day 4 .
Although not a requirement of the  study ,  attempts were made to keep the hemoglobin level > 120 g/L during pelvic irradiation .
Late complications were graded as  per the morbidity grading system suggested by Pilepich et al , 2 which takes into consideration the impact of the complication  on the patient performance and/or life-style and the required treatment for such complications (Table 2) .
The study was closed earlier because an interim analysis showed that ,  apart from increased serious toxicity ,  survival was  significantly worse in the combined approach group ,  and we did not feel that a positive result could be obtained with a  larger sample .
Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method21 and was measured from day 1 of therapy until last  follow-up or death .
The CR rate was 32.5% and 47% (P = .19) for the RT and CT + RT ,   respectively .
Seven patients were not included in response assessment in the combined modality group ,  four patients who died  of CT complications ,  two who died of metastatic disease ,  all of them before commencement of RT ,  and one other patient whosepelvic disease progressed during CT and who received palliative irradiation only because of poor general condition .
Evaluation of tumor response by pelvic examination following therapy for advanced cervical cancer is a subjective and  imprecise method of assessment .
These numbers are similar to those patients who were felt to have  obtained a CR ,  only 59% (10 of 17) and 40% (six of 15) are still alive in the RT and CT + RT groups ,  respectively .
Median survivals were 25 months in the RT arm and 10.5 months in the CT + RT .
The 5-year  survival rates for the complete responders were 57% and 36% for the RT and CT + RT groups ,  respectively .
It was equally distributed between the treatment arms (RT ,  54% ,  CT + RT ,  50%) .
The cisplatin treatment day was then changed from day 1 to  day 4 but yet another patient developed the same problem (one of 12 treated patients) .
At this time ,  an interim analysis that  was performed disclosed a survival advantage for the RT group ,  and it was then decided to close the study .
Except for two patients ,  all others had received previous treatment (CT in two ,  pelvic RT in 11 ,  and major  surgery in three) .
Although 25.5% of the patients achieved a CR following three cycles of BOMP and 47% of the CT + RT group obtained a CR at the  end of RT ,  the 5-year overall survival was significantly inferior in the CT + RT group than in the control arm (39% v 21% ,  P  = .02) .
It cannot be accounted for by patient  selection as both groups were well balanced for the wellknown prognostic factors in stage III carcinoma of the cervix.4'24-27  More importantly ,  all patients in the CT + RT arm completed pelvic RT ,  as defined by the protocol guidelines ,  and therefore ,   inadequate irradiation dosage cannot explain the poorer results .
Furthermore ,  even if we exclude the patients who experienced  treatment-related death ,  the survival in the BOMP group remains significantly inferior (39% v 25%) .
Since repopulation by surviving tumor clonogens is not  a specific response to RT but rather results from killing of tumor cells ,  these authors have suggested that CT ,  which is  effective in killing cells ,  could also lead to an accelerated regrowth of surviving clonogens ,  lessening the effect of  subsequent RT .
This may explain why in spite of a satisfactory rate of response following neoadjuvant CT ,  there was no  improvement in local tumor control ,  and survival was adversely affected .
Similarly ,  in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ,  upfront CT has produced impressive response rates ,  but again ,   this has not led to an improvement in survival rates over those achieved with RT alone .
Some randomized studies have ,  in  fact ,  showed worse survival with the use of neoadjuvant CT .
The mechanisms responsible for such cross-resistance  remain to be determined ,  but recent studies have shown significant similarity between the cytotoxicity of irradiation and  alkylating agents and that tumor cells may develop mechanisms of resistance capable of decreasing the cytotoxic effects of  some antineoplastic drugs as well as radiation .
It is a subjective evaluation that frequently depends on the ability of the investigator to differentiate  between residual local disease or treatment-induced parametrial fibrosis .
Recently ,  Chambers et al also reported a high incidence of pulmonary toxicity in patients receiving BOMP CT for gynecologic  squamous cell carcinoma .
Two  other studies reported a 14% incidence of pulmonary toxicity with one fatal drug-related event occurring in each .
