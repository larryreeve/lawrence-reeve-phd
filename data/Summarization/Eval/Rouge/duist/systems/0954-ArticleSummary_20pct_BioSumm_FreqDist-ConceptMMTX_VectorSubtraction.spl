TRIALS of postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer conducted during the 1960s and 1970s showed significant reductions in rates of locoregional recurrence but no improvement in overall survival .
Nevertheless ,  there are reasons to reconsider radiotherapy ,  including the limited value of adjuvant chemotherapy for bulky disease ,  a synergistic effect of chemotherapy plus radiation on residual locoregional tumor ,  and the possibility that eliminating bulky disease with radiation may improve the effect of chemotherapy ,  because chemotherapy may be more effective when the overall disease burden is low .
The mastectomy was performed according to standard surgical practice between 1979 and 1986 .
The characteristics of the patients were evenly balanced ,  as Table 1 shows .
Radiation .
Also ,  as part of a second randomization ,  68 patients with estrogen-positive tumors were treated with radiationinduced ovarian ablation that included 20 Gy over a period of five days plus prednisone (7.5 mg per day) for two years ,  as described by Meakin et al. Among these 68 patients ,  33 were assigned to chemotherapy and 35 were assigned to chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
Differences between these subgroups with respect to the relative risk associated with the radiation were studied by testing for significant interactions with the proportional-hazards regression model .
In the survival analysis ,  the time to the end points associated with each event was calculated from the date of the tissue diagnosis of breast cancer .
RESULTS .
All Patients .
Table 2 and Figures 1 through 4 show the results in the two groups of patients .
Subgroups Based on Nodal Involvement .
Side Effects of Radiation .
There were no cases of brachial plexopathy .
There was no excess mortality we could attribute to the long-term side effects of radiotherapy .
There was an important increase in the number of deaths not due to breast cancer among the irradiated patients (P 0.002) .
Therefore ,  the metaanalyses of previous studies may not be relevant to current practice .
Our data indicate that locoregional disease remaining after definitive surgery may be an important source of systemic disease .
The elimination of locoregional cancer cells by radiotherapy added to adjuvant chemotherapy may reduce mortality in selected patients with breast cancer .
