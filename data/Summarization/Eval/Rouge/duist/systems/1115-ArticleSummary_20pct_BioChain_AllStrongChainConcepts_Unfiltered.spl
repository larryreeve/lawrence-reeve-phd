Radical external beam plus intracavitary radiation continues to be the standard therapy for advanced cervical cancer to which all new therapies must be compared .
No substantial improvements have beenmade in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer in the past two decades .
The problem of enhancing pelvic control and survival cannot be approached simply by increasing conventionally delivered radiation dose since late complications produced by radiation are at the upper limit of acceptability with currently employed doses .
Many investigations are ongoing to identify more effective treatment .
The results reported for trials of neoadjuvant cisplatin-containing chemotherapy prior to radiation have been disappointing with six randomized trials ,  showing no advantage in local control or survival and possibly some detrimental effect .
Concurrent chemotherapy with radiation offers a number of theoretical advantages over those of the neoadjuvant strategy .
These advantages include no delay in the start of definitive irradiation ,  no prolongation of overall treatment time (thus minimizing the theoretical risk of accelerated clonogen proliferation during the antineoplastic course) ,  and possible interaction of the concurrently administered chemotherapy with radiation through such mechanisms as inhibition of repair of radiation damage ,  cell synchronization ,  recruitment of nonproliferating cells into cell cycle ,  and reduction of the hypoxic fraction .
Chemotherapy may also ,  as in the neoadjuvant strategy ,  have an independent ,  additive cytotoxic effect .
Theoretical disadvantages of concurrent administration include increased acute toxicity which might limit or delay the delivery of definitive irradiation or increased late toxicity particularly if the drugs and radiation do not exhibit ‘‘toxicity’’ independence .
Last ,  it is unlikely that concurrent chemotherapy usually given as only one or two doses would significantly reduce established distant micrometastases .
While these studies suggested some benefit for patients with FIGO stage IIIB cancer ,  methodological problems in the study have not resulted in wide acceptance of the conclusion of benefit from concurrent hydroxyurea and its concurrent use has not entered standard practice .
The optimal dosing schedule for maximizing cell kill with infusional 5-FU and radiation remains undefined ,  but laboratory data suggested greater effects with increasing dose and prolonged exposure to 5-FU and when drug was present for intervals in excess of 48 h after radiation .
An earlier extensive phase I/II study of radical irradiation and infusional 5-FU based on the in vitro information established a safe regimen with acceptable toxicity for comparison in this randomized study .
Eligible patients were to have biopsy proven invasive carcinoma of the cervix of any pathological type excluding small cell carcinoma and to have primary radiotherapy with curative intent selected as their definitive treatment .
Patients were randomized to receive either (a) standard external beam pelvic irradiation (EBRT) in a dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions defined at 100% versus ,  (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional intravenous 5-FU in a dose of 1 g/m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  (c) partially hyperfractionated RT ,  5280 cGy in 33 fractions ,  2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  or (d) arm (c) with the same infusional 5-FU .
After EBRT all patients were planned to receive low dose rate intracavitary irradiation to deliver a dose of 40 Gy at point A .
A posterior midline attenuator of two half value layers ,  3 cm in width at the midplane of the pelvis was used to reduce the dose to the bladder and rectum .
The partially hyperfractionated radiation fractionation schedule used equal fraction sizes of 160 cGy .
For rare patients with disease extension to the lower one-third of vagina ,  the first application to the cervix and uterus was modified to deliver 30 Gy at 2 cm from the center of the sources and a second application as a line source in the vagina ,  was used to deliver a further 20 Gy at 0.5 cm depth from the surface of the vagina. 5-FU was given as an infusion from days 1 to 4 inclusive and on treatment days 22 to 25 inclusive .
Appropriate guidelines for 5-FU dosage reduction or elimination were recommended for hematologic or mucosal toxicity ,  but RT interruptions were not .
The outcomes of interest in this study were pelvic control ,  survival ,  and disease-free survival ,  as well as the serious late complication rate .
Figure 1 demonstrates the study design ,  the four-arm study was designed to determine whether any significant differences in outcome were evident between arms (a) and (d) and to be explanatory with respect to causation .
Two factors were altered in arm (d) compared to standard arm (a) ,  (1) the addition of 5-FU ,  (2) the change in radiation fractionation scheme .
If differences were to be observed in pelvic control and survival in arm (d) versus arm (a) ,  this could be due to a change in either or both factors .
Assuming that the magnitude and direction of the 5-FU effects were similar in arms (b) and (d) then the effect of the addition of 5-FU could be tested by comparing arms (b) and (d) with arms (a) and (c) .
The reduced fraction size in arms (c) and (d) was designed to attempt to take advantage of knowledge of the affect of fraction size on late complications and to determine whether complication rates were decreased by using decreased fraction size .
In order to detect a 20% improvement in pelvic control rate from an expected 50% for arm (a) to 70% for arm (d) assuming an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.20 ,  73 patients in each of four treatment arms would be required for a total of 292 patients .
In order to detect an improvement of 15% in survival in arms (c) and (d) compared to that seen in arms (a) and (b) ,  assuming a 40% cause-specific survival rate in arm (a) and an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.2 ,  the total number of patients required was 272 .
The median age of the patients was 48 years with a range of 23 to 85 years .
The median duration of follow-up for the whole population is 59 months (95% confidence interval ,  57 to 66 months) .
The median size of tumor was 6.5 cm (range 3.5 to 18 cm) .
In the ‘‘partially hyperfractionated irradiation arm’’ (c) ,  two patients had radiation dose violations ,  one a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions and the other a dose of 59 Gy in 33 fractions .
The disease free 5-year survival in arm (a) ,  (c) ,  (d) ,  and (b) ,  respectively , were 45 ,  53 ,  58 ,  and 61% .
There was a significant improvement in 5-year survival and disease-free survival for those treated with standard radiation and 5-FU compared to the other treatments (log rank test P 5 0.05) .
When the radiation fraction size is reduced as in this altered fractionation scheme a compensatory increase in total dose over the same overall time is required to reach a biologically similar dose .
The time to development of serious late complications was seven to 53 months (median 16 months) .
Given the low incidence of late complications it is not possible to establish an actuarial probability of risk with these regimens .
To reach the conclusion that concurrent chemotherapy truly adds benefit to results achievable with radiation alone ,  it is important that the radiation be delivered in an optimal manner with adequate doses at ‘‘Point A’’ (80 to 90 Gy) and limited overall treatment times .
Within stratum 2 there was an improvement in pelvic control with the use of 5-FU but the difference was not statistically significant .
However ,  in stratum 1 constituted of patients with stage IB/IIA and those IIB tumors with medial parametrial involvement ,  a significant improvement in both pelvic control and disease-free survival in favor of standard radiation with concurrent 5-FU was observed (Figs. 5 and 6) .
The treatment related factors examined were the use of intracavitary radiation ,  the use of 5-FU ,  and the fractionation scheme ,  standard versus partially hyperfractionated .
Two fractions of 160 cGy per day were delivered during the infusion at the beginning and end of treatment in arm (d) .
