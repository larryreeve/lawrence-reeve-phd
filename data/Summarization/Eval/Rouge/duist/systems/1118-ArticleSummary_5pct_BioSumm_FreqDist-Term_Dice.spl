Pretreatment evaluation included a complete medical history and physical examination ,  complete blood count ,  serum electrolytes ,  chemistry profile ,  tumor markers ,  chest X ray ,  an electrocardiogram ,  and contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis .
In the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group ,  chemotherapeutic regimens consisted of cisplatin (50 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously at the rate of 1 mg/min on Day 1) ,  vincristine (1 mg/m2 intravenously push on Day 2) ,  and bleomycin (25 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously infusion in divided doses on Days 2 ,  3 ,  and 4) which were given starting on Day 1 of radiotherapy and then every 3 weeks for a total of four courses .
Although there was no significant difference between the two compared groups with regard to treatment-related late toxicity (concurrent group 23.3% versus radiation group 12.9% ,  P = 0.13) , a nonsignificant trend toward a higher rate of late toxicity in the chemoradiotherapy group is evident .
After a median follow-up of 46.8 months ,  the disease-free survival and actuarial survival rates at 3 years for patients in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group were not statistically different compared with patients in the radiotherapy group (51.7% versus 53.2% ,  P Å 0.92 ,  and 61.7% versus 64.5% ,  P Å 0.88 ,  respectively) .
Analysis by Kaplan ­ Meier method showed that the actuarial survival was not statistically different between the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups (mean survival time ,  38.1 months versus 41.5 months ,  P Å 0.27) .
The published trials in advanced cervical carcinoma with concurrent chemoradiotherapy ,  either a single-agent weekly cisplatin or in combination with cisplatin ­ 5-FU or cisplatin ­ bleomycin ­ vincristine ,  yield tumor response rates of approximately 80% ,  and 3-year survival rates reached 50 to 60% of patients .
To further increase the systemic activity and the radiation-enhancing potential of the chemotherapy ,  we chose cisplatin-based regimens with vincristine and bleomycin in this trial because it had proven high efficacy of local control in our previous phase I and II trials for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
Our results indicated that ,  despite the excellent early tumor response seen during treatment ,  the benefit of concurrent chemoradiation in terms of reduced mortality and increased pelvic control rates may not be as great as that suggested by other reports .
