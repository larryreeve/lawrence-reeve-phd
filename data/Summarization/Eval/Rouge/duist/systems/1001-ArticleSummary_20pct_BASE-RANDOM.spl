Results ,  Randomization produced balanced distribution of risk factors .
The intentionto-treat analysis gave a significant effect for overall survival (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P < .01 ,  log-rank ,  P = .02) and disease-free survival (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P = .02 ,  log-rank ,  P = .1 1) .
The therapeutic effect is maintained after 7 years of follow-up evaluation .
Wondering what the characteristic features of these trials were ,  one notes that two of these trials ,  one in lymphoma and one in breast carcinoma ,  2 had been performed with engineered antibodies ,  ie ,  either human/ murine chimeric or human complementanly defining regious (CDR)-grafted mmunoglobulins respectively ,  while the third stands out because of the target and end point used .
In contrast to other trials aimed at patients with larger metastatic tumor masses and using regression or shrinkage as the end point ,  this one on colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C required microscopically complete resection of the primary tumor for patients to be admitted.3 As the primary end point ,  overall-survival was determined at 5 years .
The multicenter study consisted of six academic centers in former West Germany A total of 189 patients were randomized ,  with the first patient entered in May 1985 and the last in Apnl 1990 The study was closed in December 1992 ,  and we present here the final status with median follow-up data of 7 years Eligible patients were required to have histologically confirmed adenocarcmoma of colon or the rectum with spread to regional lymph nodes (Dukes' C or International Unimon Agamst Cancer [UICC] stage III) In addition ,  hlstopathologic confirmation of curative resection (R0) was secured Radical tumor resection was performed by a standardized technique agreed upon by all participating centers When located within 15 cm of the anal verge ,  a tumor was classified as rectal carcinoma Patients were less than 70 years old and had a Karnofsky index greater than 50% Eleven of 99 patients randomized to treatment refused their treatment assignment ,  but were otherwise considered eligible for the study .
In brief ,  patients were staged after surgery and had a chest radiogram and abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography scan .
A documented histologic or radiologic diagnosis of disease was  required to confirm local or distant recurrence ,  whereas abnormal CEA values were not used as evidence of relapse .
Recent data on cell lines transfected with 17-1A cDNA suggest that the antigen s involved in cell-cell adhesion .
The presented 7-year follow-up data may therefore be considered mature and final .
Since the 5-year follow-up evaluation ,  four additional deaths occurred m the treated group and nine additional deaths in the control group .
When cancer-related mortality was assessed ,  ie ,  death without recurrence was not counted as event ,  the benefit of treatment remained significant at P < .01 by Cox's multivariate analysis and P = .01 by log-rank test for the univariate analysis .
Recurrence .
The reduction in recurrence was 23% (hazards ratio ,  0.66 ,  95% confidence interval ,  1% to 43%) Recurrence-free intervals were plotted according to Kaplan-Maier (Fig 2) .
Antibody treatment increased time to recurrence (P = .04 with Cox proportional hazards model corrected for influence of prognostic variables ,  and P = .07 with log-rank test for umvanate analysis) .
Another reason for this difference may be local radiation applied to rectum carcinoma patients in the control group ,  as detailed further later .
When tested for antibody response against murine antibody (HAMA) ,  80% of treated patients developed a distinct HAMA response after the second or third nfusion .
In brief ,  after the first two infusions ,  antibody titers were low and reached their maximum only after a fifth nfusion at 18 to 20 weeks after surgery ,  but remained detectable for 2 more years .
The conspicuous inefficacy of the antibody on local recurrences (Fig 4) may account for the smaller P values in the disease-free-interval analysis .
In the antibody trial ,  both colon and rectum cancer patients were enrolled onto the trial presented here .
Since these forms of therapy were administered only to the control group ,  a bias may have been introduced that influenced the outcome against the antibody treatment ,  which explains the apparent difference seen m the local recurrence rate (Table 2) .
It is noteworthy that in various reports ,  results recorded after a 5-year observation period do not necessarily hold up when patients are monitored for an additional time of 2 years .
This finding lends some support to the concept of long-lasting dormancy in early disseminated tumor cells .
Interestingly ,  in the most recent report (median follow-up time ,  6.5 years) ,  adjuvant therapy with fluorouracil plus levamisol administered to patients with Dukes' C colon cancer had only a minimal effect on local recurrences .
In that trial ,  only colon cancer patients were treated who were known to have fewer local relapses than rectum cancer patients and were included in our trial .
Thus far ,  this assay has been negative .
Thus far ,  in murine systems ,  breaking of tolerance against autoantigens via the antildotype route has not yet been shown in an unambiguous fashion .
By double staining of individual metastatic cells in bone marrow ,  It was shown that the 17-lA target is expressed by disseminated cells in only two thirds of the examined patients .
Furthermore ,  humanized antibodies or entirely human antibodies generated from human mmunoglobulin gene hbrarles that are less Immunogenic than murine antibodies are now being tested .
The discovery of the adhesion function of the 17-1A molecule , hence the new name EpCAM ,  raised the speculation that the antibody inhibited outgrowth of metastasis by interference with cell-cell adhesion .
