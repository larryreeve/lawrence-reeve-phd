THE ANTIMETABOLITES methotrexate MTX and 5-fluorouracil 5-FU have become established over the past quarter century among the most useful cancer chemotherapeutic agents .
MTX has been widely used as a single agent for treatment of head and neck cancer while 5-FU is a major drug for treatment of advanced colorectal and gastric cancer .
The two drugs have been used together clinically on empirical grounds for some time particularly in the treatment of breast cancer but data from experimental tumors in vivo and in vitro document both synergistic and antagonistic interactions .
The sequential exposure of L1210 cells to MTX and then to 5-FU was shown to increase the intracellular concentration of 5-FU ribonucleotides a potential mechanism of synergy .
Sequential administration of moderate doses of MTX followed by 5-FU has been reported effective in advanced head and neck cancer and colorectal cancer as well as breast cancer but the importance of the sequence remains uncertain .
Since our primary objective was to compare the treatment sequences we chose to include patients with a variety of tumors reasonably treated with either MTX or 5-FU as single agents .
The inclusion of some patients with previously untreated stage II head and neck cancer reflected the opinion of the combined head and neck clinic that they were unsuitable for cure by surgery or radiotherapy .
Central telephone randomization used balanced blocks stratified only by primary site to assign one of two treatment sequences: either MTX followed one hour later by 5-FU MF .
or 5-FU followed SEQUENTIAL MTX/5-FU .
Subsequent treatment was dependent on the primary site and on prior treatment but was defined by the protocol to be radiotherapy after completion of protocol chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer .
Among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer disease stage expressed as TNM separately and as stage grouping using standard definitions of the American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging and- End Result reporting were also examined as possible prognostic factors for response and survival .
This was most extreme among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer: of this subgroup 65 responded to the sequence of MF while 39 of entered patients including 47 of those evaluable for response responded to the reverse FM sequence P .18 Fisher's exact test .
Because most responding patients with head and neck cancer received radiotherapy while still in response no meaningful response duration could be determined instead survival times are presented Table 3 with a median survival of at least 13 months in all groups .
Patients with head and neck cancer had significantly longer survival than those with other primary sites P .001 reflecting the relatively earlier stage at which chemotherapy was used in head and neck cancer .
Survival duration was not significantly different by treatment sequence in univariate analyses though the trend favored the sequence of 5-FU before MTX in which the median survival had not been reached at 23 months compared to a median survival of 13.3 months in the group receiving MTX before 5-FU .
Because the question at issue was the sequence of drug administration rather than the study of a particular tumor type we chose to include patients with SCCs of the head and neck colorectal or gastric adenocarcinoma and other SCCs reasonably treated by either MTX or 5-FU .
Browman et al have conducted a similar trial in which patients with head and neck cancer were randomized to receive MTX followed one hour later by 5-FU or the same two drugs given simultaneously .
