No substantial improvements have beenmade in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer in the past two decades .
In addition to modifications of radiation therapy multiple studies have investigated ,  and are investigating ,  strategies that combine radiation with chemotherapy either as neoadjuvant or concurrent administration .
The attenuator was used throughout the treatment course in those treated with a box technique and for half the fractions in those treated with a parallel pair .
The ‘‘Lifetest Procedure’’ in SAS UNIX was used to compare survival curves .
Cox’s proportional hazards model was used to examine the variables which might contribute to pelvic control or survival within stratum 1 .
Of the 234 patients randomized ,  221 were evaluable .
The number excluded in each stratum were 6 in stratum 1 ,  3 in stratum 2 ,  and 4 in stratum 3 .
Only 17 were instratum 3 .
In view of the small number of patients in stratum 3 ,  a detailed breakdown of possible tumor prognostic factors is not shown .
In the ‘‘standard arm’’ (a) ,  53 of 54 received the prescribed tumor dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions .
Tumor was grade 1 in 8 of 221 (4%) ,  grade 2 in 106 of 221 (48%) ,  and grade 3 in 75 of the 221 (34%) .
Capillary lymphatic space (CLS) involvement was commented on in 146 of 221 (66%) .
Pelvic Control and Survival .
With a median duration of follow-up of 59 months ,  119 of 221 patients are alive ,  111 without evidence of disease ,  and 8 with disease present .
Eighty-four have died of disease and 4 have died of other causes with disease present .
The Kaplan–Meier plots of overall disease-free survival ,  disease-free survival for each stratum ,  and disease free survival by treatment assigned are shown in Figs. 2 ,  3 ,  and4 ,  respectively .
There is no significant difference in the overall 5-year disease-free survival between the treatment arms .
The disease-free survival by treatment arm for the 99 patients in stratum 1 is shown in Fig. 5 .
There was a significant improvement in 5-year survival and disease-free survival for those treated with standard radiation and 5-FU compared to the other treatments (log rank test P 5 0.05) .
Table 4 .
A factorial analysis of the magnitude of the impact of differences in the radiation schedule or the addition of 5-FU on the improvements in pelvic control and disease-free survival in stratum 1 was performed .
Pelvic control was 66% for those who did not receive 5-FU compared to 84% for those who did (P 5 0.07) .
However ,  in evaluating the importance of the contribution of the change in fractionation to the differences observed ,  there was no significant difference in the 5-year survival of those treated on standard radiation versus those treated with hyperfractionated irradiation whether or not 5-FU was used .
It was hoped that the use of two treatments daily during the 5-FU infusion would increase any opportunity for 5-FU-radiation interaction by increasing the total amount of radiation given concurrently with 5-FU .
Stratum 2 was examined for differences in pelvic control and survival between the treatment arms and no significant differences were observed .
We wished to determine whether there was an accumulation of ‘‘bad risk’’ factors in the group receiving standard radiation alone or alternatively that there was an accumulation of ‘‘good risk’’ factors in patients receiving standard RT and 5-FU .
For those receiving standard RT ,  the pelvic control rate was 60% but the disease-free survival was only 39% .
Eight occurred in those receiving standard radiation and five in those receiving altered RT .
Seven occurred in the group receiving 5-FU and six in those without 5-FU .
DISCUSSION .
Patients were stratified into three groups in this study because pelvic control and survival outcomes are strongly influenced by the bulk of pelvic disease ,  declining with increasing bulk .
The original design for this study required 292 patients with adequate power to detect a 15% difference in pelvic control and survival .
It is therefore not surprising that significant differences in survival and pelvic control were not observed in the overall population .
Within stratum 2 there was an improvement in pelvic control with the use of 5-FU but the difference was not statistically significant .
However ,  in stratum 1 constituted of patients with stage IB/IIA and those IIB tumors with medial parametrial involvement ,  a significant improvement in both pelvic control and disease-free survival in favor of standard radiation with concurrent 5-FU was observed (Figs. 5 and 6) .
The disease-free survival with standard radiation alone ,  however ,  was surprisingly low at 39% .
A factorial analysis compared the outcome for all patients treated with concurrent 5-FU compared to those without 5-FU .
Because of the small numbers in each treatment arm it was surprising to observe a significant difference .
With so few randomized the possibility exists that an imbalance in prognostic factors exists between the treatment arms might account for the observed outcome differences .
Such a benefit was not observed in this study .
From the subset analysis of this trial we have generated the hypothesis that there may be a beneficial effect of adding concurrent infusional 5-FU to standard in patients with the disease characteristics of stratum 1 .
Since the data are not conclusive because of limited numbers ,  confirmation of the beneficial effects observed in this study is necessary .
