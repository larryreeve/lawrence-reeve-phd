While no therapy has been proven more effective than radical external-beam plus intracavitary radiotherapy ,  considerable research effort ,  including addition of chemotherapy plus radiation ,  is currently being put into improving survival rate in patients with advanced carcinoma of the cervix .
The rationale for adding chemotherapy to pelvic radiation is to provide systemic cytotoxic agents active against cervical cancer with the potential to enhance the radiosensitivity ,  to enhance local tumor control ,  and to eradicate micrometastasis .
The concurrent use of radiation and chemotherapy ,  either as a single agent or in combination ,  has also been demonstrated to be effective in the local control of advanced carcinoma of the cervix with acceptable toxicity as presented by several reports ,  and was also supported by our previous phase I and II trial .
Other eligibility criteria consisted of a pathologically verified squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix ,  a Karnofsky performance status index of 80% or above ,  and an age of younger than 70 years .
Pretreatment evaluation included a complete medical history and physical examination ,  complete blood count ,  serum electrolytes ,  chemistry profile ,  tumor markers ,  chest X ray ,  an electrocardiogram ,  and contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis .
In the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group ,  chemotherapeutic regimens consisted of cisplatin (50 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously at the rate of 1 mg/min on Day 1) ,  vincristine (1 mg/m2 intravenously push on Day 2) ,  and bleomycin (25 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously infusion in divided doses on Days 2 ,  3 ,  and 4) which were given starting on Day 1 of radiotherapy and then every 3 weeks for a total of four courses .
Survival was defined as the observed length of life from protocol entry to death or until January 5 ,  1997 when the data analysis was finished and patients were still alive .
At a two-sided P value of 0.05 ,  with the use of a Pearson x2 approximation ,  the estimated power was 80% an improvement of 25% in survival with the concurrent therapy at the a Å 0.05 level (two-sided test) .
The tumor response was significantly higher in patients receiving concurrent chemoradia tion than in pa tients who rece ived radiatio n alone (P = 0.04) .
The acute treatment-related toxicity (grade 3 or 4) appears to be higher with the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group when compared with radiation group (36.7% versus 17.7% ,  P Å 0.02) .
Although there was no significant difference between the two compared groups with regard to treatment-related late toxicity (concurrent group 23.3% versus radiation group 12.9% ,  P = 0.13) , a nonsignificant trend toward a higher rate of late toxicity in the chemoradiotherapy group is evident .
An analysis of the patterns of failure reveals that the incidence of pelvic failure was equally distributed between the treatment groups (31.7% versus 30.6% ,  P Å 0.93) .
The median time to pelvic recurrence was 15 months (range ,  7 ­ 19 months) ,  whereas the median time to distant recurrence was 21 months (range ,  12 ­ 33 months) .
Survival Of the chemoradiotherapy group ,  31 patients (51.7%) are alive without evidence of disease ,  6 (10%) remain alive with disease ,  and 21 (35%) died of disease at 7 ­ 48 months .
Of the 9 patients requiring treatment delays ,  7 patients (77.8%) died of disease (5) or are alive with disease (2) ,  whereas 18 of the 49 patients (36.7%) who had completed their planned treatment without treatment delays died of disease or are alive with disease .
Of the radiation group ,  33 patients (53.2%) are alive without evidence of disease ,  7 (11.3%) remain alive with disease ,  and 22 (35.5%) died of disease at 12 ­ 45 months .
After a median follow-up of 46.8 months ,  the disease-free survival and actuarial survival rates at 3 years for patients in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group were not statistically different compared with patients in the radiotherapy group (51.7% versus 53.2% ,  P Å 0.92 ,  and 61.7% versus 64.5% ,  P Å 0.88 ,  respectively) .
Analysis by Kaplan ­ Meier method showed that the actuarial survival was not statistically different between the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups (mean survival time ,  38.1 months versus 41.5 months ,  P Å 0.27) .
These failures may be attributed to large central tumor volumes ,  parametrial extensions of disease resistant to local therapies ,  or metastatic disease outside the radiation field .
Therefore ,  the design of a more efficient treatment modality ,  such as the addition of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy ,  with the objective of increasing tumor control and long-term survival for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma ,  is advocated .
Therefore ,  in an attempt to improve tumor control and survival in patients with advanced cervical carcinoma ,  the treatment efficacy and tolerability of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy using cisplatin-based chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer needs to be explored .
The concept of concurrent chemoradiotherapy offers a number of theoretical advantages ,  which produces no delay in the start of definitive radiotherapy ,  no time gap to induce cross-resistance ,  and the possibility of eradication of subclinical metastasis .
The published trials in advanced cervical carcinoma with concurrent chemoradiotherapy ,  either a single-agent weekly cisplatin or in combination with cisplatin ­ 5-FU or cisplatin ­ bleomycin ­ vincristine ,  yield tumor response rates of approximately 80% ,  and 3-year survival rates reached 50 to 60% of patients .
Therefore ,  to test the hypothesis of concurrent chemoradiotherapy improving the survival rate of advanced cervical cancer ,  in 1990 we began a phase III randomized trial comparing concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus pelvic radiation alone in patients with advanced cervical carcinoma at our institution .
To further increase the systemic activity and the radiation-enhancing potential of the chemotherapy ,  we chose cisplatin-based regimens with vincristine and bleomycin in this trial because it had proven high efficacy of local control in our previous phase I and II trials for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
Although the response rate of 88.4% ,  following concurrent chemoradiotherapy ,  in our study is very encouraging when compared with 74.3% of the radiotherapy group at the end of therapy ,  this study does not provide evidence that chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone with respect to survival .
Our results indicated that ,  despite the excellent early tumor response seen during treatment ,  the benefit of concurrent chemoradiation in terms of reduced mortality and increased pelvic control rates may not be as great as that suggested by other reports .
The most likely explanation for the poor results in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group is the higher treatmentrelated toxicity ,  and that could limit the dose of definitive radiation employed or interrupt the planned radiotherapy .
On the other hand ,  a probable explanation for the poor survival in advanced cervical cancer patients ,  in spite of a satisfactory rate of initial response ,  may be the enhancement of accelerated tumor proliferation during treatment .
Therefore ,  in patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix ,  improvement in local control will not translate into an improved long-term outcome because this gain will be offset by the eventual development of a relapse .
It is desirable for future studies to see whether other chemotherapeutic regiments such as 5-FU or weekly cisplatin would be more likely to be tolerable and be associated with fewer treatment interruptions .
