THE American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics define stage IB cervical cancer as invasive cancer that is confined to the cervix ,  with a depth of more than 5 mm and a width of more than 7 mm. In patients with large stage IB cervical cancers ,  local control and survival are poorer than in patients with smaller stage I cancers ,  whether treated by surgery or irradiation .
METHODS .
Patients .
Patients with histologic evidence of lymph-node involvementwere not eligible ,  nor were those who had previously received radiotherapy or chemotherapy or those with a history of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer .
In addition ,  patients had to be medically suitable for hysterectomy .
Radiotherapy .
Fractions of 1.8 to 2.0 Gy were delivered 5 days a week over a period of 4 1/2 to 5 weeks ,  for a total dose of 45 Gy .
Chemotherapy .
A maximum of six doses of cisplatin was given .
Hysterectomy .
No vaginal cuff was removed .
Quality Control and Follow-up .
Outcome .
The hysterectomy specimens were evaluated for evidence of cancer .
Statistical Analysis .
All reported P values are two-tailed .
RESULTS .
Characteristics of the Patients .
There were no significant differences in demographic or tumor characteristics between the two groups (Table 1) .
Adverse Effects .
Progression-free Survival .
Survival .
The median duration of follow-up was 36 months .
Prognostic Factors .
DISCUSSION .
Therefore ,  we chose to test the value of concurrent treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy followed by hysterectomy as compared with that of radiotherapy alone followed by hysterectomy .
We believe that the value of hysterectomy in these patients is doubtful .
The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment ,  but they share a common result ,  all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin .
