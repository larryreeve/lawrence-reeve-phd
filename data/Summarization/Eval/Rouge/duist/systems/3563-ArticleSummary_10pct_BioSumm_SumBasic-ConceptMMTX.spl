Patients requiring anastomosis to the rectum or third or fourth portion of the duodenum were excluded because the single-layer continuous method is awkward when both ends of the bowel cannot be fully mobilized .
The study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board ,  which also granted a waiver of consent because both methods were in common use in our institution and had similar results .
Calculations for the outcome variables of leak ,  abscess ,  and time for construction of the anastomosis used the number of anastomoses in each group for the denominator .
Anastomotic leaks ,  intraabdominal abscesses ,  length of time required for anastomosis ,  length of stay ,  and material costs are shown for both groups in Table 2 .
The two-layer interrupted anastomosis has its origins in the early 19th century through the experimental work of Travers and of Lembert ,  who advocated careful approximation of the serosal surfaces of the bowel and devised a method of suturing to accomplish this .
Other traditional risk factors such as diabetes ,  steroids ,  anastomotic method ,  blood loss ,  and nutritional factors have not clearly been predictive of anastomotic failure .
Numerous studies in the literature comparing techniques (e.g. ,  one-layer vs. two-layer ,  hand-sewn vs. stapled ,  and end-to-end vs. end-to-side) have failed to demonstrate a clear superiority of one over another .
The senior authors of this paper (J.M.B. ,  E.E.M.) have used the single-layer technique exclusively for many years and can routinely perform an anastomosis in 8 to 10 minutes .
Bailey et al have speculated that the continuous single-layer suture ,  which resembles a circular coiled spring ,  may be able to expand and contract depending on intraluminal forces .
To detect a significant difference in leakage rates based on our data ,  a power analysis indicated that 1,500 patients would be required .
