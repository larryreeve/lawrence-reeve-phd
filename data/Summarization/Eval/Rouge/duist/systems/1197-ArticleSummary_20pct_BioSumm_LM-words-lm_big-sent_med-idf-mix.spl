Stratification was by primary versus recurrent tumors and by tumor diameter greater than or equal to 10 cm versus less than 10 cm. One hundred four patients were randomized ,  51 to the control group and 53 to the treatment group (five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin 60 mg/m2 days 1 and 2 and ifosfamide 1.8 g/m2 days 1 through 5 ,  with hydration ,  mesna ,  and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) .
The treatment of limb sarcomas mainly relies on a combined-modality approach ,  after the demonstration that pre-or postoperative radiation and conservative surgery led to local control in a high proportion of patients.4 In fact ,  limb-sparing procedures allow an 85% to 90% local dis-ease-free survival (DFS) rate and demolitive surgery now represents only 5% to 10% of the operations in comparison with the 50% survival rate of the 1960s to 1970s .
The staging consisted of a computed tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging of the primary lesion ,  and a CT scan of the thorax ,  other specific tests (angiography ,  bone scan ,  CT scan of the brain ,  and so on) were performed only in the case of clinical suspicion .
Inclusion criteria were as follows ,  age ,  18 to 65 years ,  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2 ,  primary tumors subfascially localized with diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm ,  high-grade spindle-cell or polymorphous sarcomas (fibrosarcoma ,  malignant fibrous histiocytoma ,  polymorphous liposarcoma ,  leiomyosarcoma ,  synovial sarcoma ,  malignant schwannoma ,  angiosarcoma ,  and polymorphous rhabdomyosarcoma) ,  local relapse of any size ,  no previous radio/chemotherapy ,  adequate bone marrow (WBC count of >= 4,000/fiL ,  platelets = 120.000/mL ,  and hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL) ,  renal (creatinine <= 1.3 mg/dL) ,  hepatic (SGOT <= 2.5 X normal value and bilirubin <= 1.2 mg/dL) ,  and pulmonary functions .
Exclusion criteria were as follows ,  distant or regional lymph-node metastases ,  previous malignancy ,  medical or psychiatric illness precluding correct written informed consent ,  pregnancy ,  uncontrolled infections ,  and risk of being lost to follow-up .
Wide resection followed by postoperative radiation therapy (64 to 66 Gy in 32 to 33 fractions ,  5 fractions per week) was used for patients amenable to conservative surgery with negative margins .
Preoperative radiation therapy (44.8 Gy in 28 fractions in 2.5 weeks ,  160 cGy/ fraction ,  2 fractions per day) followed by resection with or without a post-or intraoperative boost (16 to 18 Gy for positive or close surgical margins) was used for tumors extending to critical structures for which conservative surgical resection was expected to be inadequate and amputation would usually have to be performed to obtain negative margins .
Chemotherapy ,  repeated every 3 weeks ,  consisted of five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin (EPI) 60 mg/m2/die ,  in a short intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1 and 2 (total dose per cycle ,  120 mg/m2) ,  IFO 1.8 g/m2/die diluted in 500 mL of normal saline and administered over 1 hour on days 1 through 5 (total dose per cycle ,  9 g/m2) ,  and 6-mercapto-ethansulfonate in a bolus IV injection at 20% of the IFO dose ,  given before and 4 and 8 hours after the IFO infusions .
Hydration (1,500 to 2,000 mL of fluids IV after chemotherapy) ,  antiemetics (5-hydroxytryptamine-3 antagonists) ,  and filgrastim (300 fig/d SC ,  days 8 through 15) were routinely administered .
In the case of incomplete hematologic recovery (defined as WBC < 4,000/mL and platelets [PLTS] < 100.000/mL) ,  treatment was postponed by one or more weeks ,  furthermore ,  on complete hematologic recovery ,  a dose reduction of EPI was applied depending on the observed nadirs (WBC > 1,000/mL and PLTS > 75.000/mL ,  IFO and EPI doses both 100% ,  WBC > 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL ,  IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 75% ,  WBC < 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL ,  IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 50%) .
Physical examinations ,  routine chemistry ,  and x-ray of the thorax and bones underlying the primary site were performed every 2 months and a CT scan of the thorax was performed every 6 months for the first 2 years .
The same procedures were repeated every 3 months during the third year and every 6 months during the fourth and fifth year of follow-up ,  with a CT scan of the thorax and/or primary site performed at every other visit .
On the basis of the estimated proportions of patients free from metastatic disease 2 years after diagnosis (60% in the treated group v 40% in the control group) ,  it was estimated that 95 patients were required per arm (beta = 0.80 ,  alpha = 0.05) .
All centers faxed protocol-specific eligibility checklists to the statistics office in Aviano ,  patients were stratified using a four-block stratification by primary tumor (diameter < 10 cm v >= 10 cm) and recurrent tumor (diameter < 10 cm v >= 10 cm) and randomized to treatment or control groups .
The intensities of local recurrences and of distant (with or without simultaneous local) recurrences were estimated by the cumulative incidence function (CIF) approach to the analysis of competing risks.14 The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to test the hypothesis of equality of the distribution of some covariates in the two treatment groups .
The remaining 68 patients (65%) were treated using a limb-sparing procedure involving radiation therapy and surgery ,  45 underwent surgery and postoperative radiation therapy ,  and 24 underwent preoperative radiation therapy and conservative surgery (Table 1) .
The median time between surgery and the start of chemotherapy was 62 days (range ,  8 to 187 days) ,  in the three cases with early metastases ,  the time intervals between surgery and relapse were 42 ,  74 ,  and 89 days .
One patient refused the fifth and last cycle for personal reasons ,  and three patients did not complete the treatment because of related toxicities (reappearance of viral uveitis ,  consecutive episodes of pneumonitis ,  and persistent leukopenia) after two ,  three ,  and four cycles ,  respectively .
A total of 223 cycles were administered ,  62 (28%) at a reduced EPI dose (12% of the total cycles had doses reduced to 75% and 16% were reduced to 50%) ,  contrary to the protocol ,  IFO was also reduced to 75% and 50% of the planned dose in 3% and 1% of the total cycles ,  respectively .
The average median relative dose-intensity (DI) of the program was 83.3% (Table 2) ,  63% of the cycles were given at a DI of >= 80% and 48% at a DI of >= 90% .
From the third cycle ,  grade 4 leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were less frequent because of the applied dose reductions ,  and anemia became the most important hematologic side effect ,  requiring repeated packed red cell transfusions in 24% of the patients .
The ranges for the observation time (ie ,  the time between randomization and date of last visit) among censored patients who did not die were 28 to 84 months ,  39 to 84 months ,  and 28 to 81 months ,  respectively .
Univariate analyses did not reveal any statistically significant difference in overall DFS and OS for any of the characteristics considered (age ,  sex ,  center of surgery ,  histology ,  grading ,  site of primary tumor ,  presentation ,  diameter ,  local treatment ,  and stratification) with the exception of adjuvant treatment (data not shown) .
Because none of the patient characteristics was associated with the end point at the time of univariate analysis ,  unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed by means of the Cox proportional hazards model .
The absolute improvement deriving from chemotherapy was 27% at 2 years (72% and 45% in the treatment and control arms ,  respectively ,  P = .003) ,  and 13% at 4 years (50% and 37% ,  respectively ,  P = .19) (Table 5) .
The cumulative incidence function estimates at 2 years were 0% and 10% for the treatment and the control arms ,  respectively (P = .02) ,  and at 4 years ,  they were 6% and 17% ,  respectively (P = .09) (Table 5) .
The distribution between the different local treatment modalities (radical surgery ,  surgery and postoperative radiation therapy ,  and preoperative radiation therapy and surgery) was respectively ,  two of 16 patients ,  seven of 20 ,  and two of 15 for the control group and three of 20 patients ,  six of 24 ,  and zero of nine for the treatment group .
As the first event ,  a total of 47 distant relapses were observed (22 single distant events in the control group and 21 in the treatment group ,  one synchronous distant and local event in the control group and three in the treatment group Table 4) .
The absolute improvement deriving from chemotherapy was 13% at 2 years (85% and 72% in the treatment and control arms ,  respectively ,  P = .10) ,  and the improvement increased to 19% at 4 years (69% and 50% ,  P = .04) (Table 5) .
The preliminary data of previous studies were sometimes positive for DFS and OS , 15-19 but further analyses ,  made after an adequate follow-up time ,  indicated a disappearance of the positive effect of chemotherapy on 20,21 and ,  in some cases ,  worse results.22 However ,  the recently published meta-analysis , 7 involving 1,568 patients ,  showed a statistically significant benefit for treated patients of 6% ,  10% ,  and 10% for local ,  metastatic ,  and overall DFS ,  respectively ,  and a favorable (but not statistically significant) trend in OS (4%) ,  after a median of 9.4 years of follow-up .
In fact ,  disease stages ,  tumor sizes ,  and grading varied greatly.23 Second ,  eight studies made use of a polychemotherapy including an anthracycline ,  vincristine ,  cyclophosphamide ,  and dacarbazine ,  but only the first is active in soft tissue sarcomas ,  the others probably increased toxicity .
Third ,  six studies used doxorubicin as a single agent at doses ranging from 60 to 90 mg/m2 per cycle (total doses of 420 to 540 mg/m2) ,  whereas the per cycle and total doxorubicin doses in the polychemotherapy studies were 50 to 90 mg/m2 and 200 to 550 mg/m2 ,  respectively ,  indicating possible underdosing of the principal active agent .
Furthermore ,  these studies did not use IFO ,  which is now recognized as an active agent in this disease.24-26 In addition to the inclusion of IFO ,  the recent introduction of hematopoietic growth factors has allowed an increase in the doses and dose-intensity without negatively affecting patient safety .
The early 1990s saw the activation of a number of second-generation protocols throughout the world ,  which ,  although they were planned independently ,  were extraordinarily similar in terms of their selection criteria ,  chemotherapeutic regimens ,  and use of growth factors .
It is directly derived from consecutive phase I-II dose-intensification trials carried out at the Centro di Riferimento Oncologico of Aviano.27,31 The epirubicin dose level of 60 mg/m2 X 2 days represents the step before the maximum-tolerated dose established in those trials (70 mg/m2 epirubicin X 2 days) when given in combination with fixed full doses of ifosfamide (1.8 g/m2/d X 5 days) in advanced cases of soft tissue sarcoma .
This maximum-tolerated dose gave 13 responses of 13 assessable patients ,  but induced relevant toxicities.31 Therefore ,  in the present study ,  the age of the patients was limited to 65 years ,  the number of cycles was limited to five ,  and a predefined dose reduction scheme was established to reduce the dose of anthracycline depending on the level of leukopenia reached during the previous cycle .
In fact ,  despite the routine use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ,  grade 4 leukopenia was observed in 28% of the administered cycles ,  neutropenic fever in 13% of the patients (16 episodes out of 223 cycles ,  7.2%) ,  and anemia requiring multiple transfusions occurred in 24% of the patients .
Moreover ,  this treatment option5,32,33 was chosen for those patients presenting with locally far-advanced disease or with disease approaching critical structures (nerves and vessels) ,  therefore a high incidence of local relapse could be foreseen .
However ,  because our study was designed in 1991 and activated in June 1992 and included only 104 patients ,  it is possible that an imbalance of other prognostic factors not included in Table 1 could have led to the difference in outcome between the two groups .
