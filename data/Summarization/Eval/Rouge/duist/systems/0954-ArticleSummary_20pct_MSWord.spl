In the late 1970s ,  adjuvant chemotherapy became a standard treatment for high-risk premenopausal patients with breast cancer .
After written informed consent was obtained ,  the patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy plus locoregional radiotherapy in five fields (the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group ,  with 164 patients) and those receiving chemotherapy alone (the chemotherapy group ,  with 154 patients) .
ChemotherapyRadiationStatistical AnalysisEleven patients (3.5 percent) were lost to follow-up — three (1.9 percent) from the chemotherapy group and eight (4.9 percent) from the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group .
Of the 164 patients randomly assigned to chemotherapy and radiotherapy ,  12 did not receive radiotherapy and were treated with chemotherapy alone (7 declined radiotherapy ,  3 had metastases before radiotherapy ,  and 2 had postsurgical complications) .
All PatientsDuring the 15 years of follow-up ,  breast cancer had recurred in 176 patients and 144 patients died .
Of the 176 patients with recurrences ,  the disease returned locoregionally as a first event in 55 and systemically in 169; 14 additional patients had locoregional recurrences after a systemic recurrence .
Study GroupsIn the group treated with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy ,  79 of 164 patients had recurrences — locoregional ,  systemic ,  or both — as compared with 97 of 154 patients in the group given chemotherapy alone .
There was an overall reduction of 34 percent in the rate of systemic recurrence (relative risk ,  0.66; 95 percent confidence interval ,  0.49 to 0.89; P 0.006) in the group treated with combined therapy (75 of 164 patients vs. 94 of 154 patients in the group treated only with chemotherapy) ,  and a 17-percentage-point improvement in systemic disease-free survival (Fig .
2) .
Mortality from breast cancer was reduced by 29 percent in the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group (relative risk ,  0.71; 95 percent confidence interval , Among the 94 patients who had systemic relapses after chemotherapy alone ,  19 were alive at the time of the 15-year analysis ,  as compared with 9 of the 75 patients with such relapses in the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group .
Radiation also improved outcome in the 68 patients randomly assigned to ovarian ablation ,  in regard to disease-free survival (relative risk ,  0.72) ,  survival free of systemic disease (relative risk ,  0.76) ,  and overall survival (relative risk ,  0.88) .
In one patient with a right-sided breast lesion , This study of premenopausal women with breast cancer demonstrates that locoregional radiotherapy reduces the rates of locoregional and systemic relapses and the chance of dying from breast cancer .
protection from systemic relapse to node-positive patients .
The Stockholm trial also provides evidence that locoregional radiotherapy in node-positive patients decreases the risk of systemic metastases .
present in patients with node-positive breast cancer ,  although it is coming into use to treat patients with 10 or more positive nodes and occasionally those with 4 or more positive nodes .
The routine use of radiation in all node-positive patients would representa substantial shift in treatment for breast cancer .
The elimination of locoregional cancer cells by radiotherapy added to adjuvant chemotherapy may reduce mortality in selected patients with breast cancer .
