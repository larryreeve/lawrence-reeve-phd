ADVANCED colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common oncologic challenges encountered in the Western world .
These responses are usually partial ,  sometimes questionable ,  and generally very transient .
These effects presumably occur through the action of thymidine in blocking oxidative metabolism of 5-FU and increasing 5-FU incorporation into RNA .
Synergistic activity with the PALA-5-FU combination was demonstrated in murine tumor systems .
Levamisole is an agent that has been used extensively to treat parasitic infections in man and domestic animals .
It has also been shown to have immunomodulatory effects .
METHODS .
Patient Selection .
It was also required that the patient be ambulatory and maintaining a reasonable state of nutrition .
Randomization Procedures .
Treatment Methodology .
This corresponded to the method used by the New York Memorial group .
For all regimens .
WBC count and platelet counts were obtained weekly .
Evaluation of Results .
It was planned to enter a minimum of 300 eligible and evaluable patients .
Statistical Methods .
P values were two-sided .
Early termination did not occur .
Thus ,  essentially no adjustment of the P values given below is required .
RESULTS .
Toxicity .
One patient died in irreversible coma .
Therapeutic Results .
Grade of anaplasia also proved to be a powerful prognostic predictor .
DISCUSSION .
In each of the regimens we tested ,  drug dosages and scheduling were admittedly largely arbitrary .
It is entirely possible that different proportionate representation of drug dosages or different scheduling could produce more favorable or less favorable results than we observed .
The dose-limiting mucocutaneous toxicity that we observed undoubtedly represented the additive effects of both agents .
Our results were disappointing .
Further exploration of the 5-FU-PALA theme might be justified on this basis .
We would hope this could be done more successfully with increasing knowledge of how best to apply the results of experimental models in the clinical settings .
