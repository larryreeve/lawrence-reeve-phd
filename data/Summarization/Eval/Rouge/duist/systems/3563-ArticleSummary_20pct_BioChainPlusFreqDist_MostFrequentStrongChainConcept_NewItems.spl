Of these ,  the method that has proven successful in most situations and in the hands of most surgeons has been the two-layer anastomosis using interrupted silk sutures for an outer inverted seromuscular layer and a running absorbable suture for a transmural inner layer .
Recently ,  several reports have appeared advocating a single-layer continuous anastomosis using monofilament plastic suture .
This anastomosis requires less time to fashion ,  costs less than any other method ,  and may have a lower risk of leakage .
Patients requiring anastomosis to the rectum or third or fourth portion of the duodenum were excluded because the single-layer continuous method is awkward when both ends of the bowel cannot be fully mobilized .
The study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board ,  which also granted a waiver of consent because both methods were in common use in our institution and had similar results .
All two-layer anastomoses were constructed using interrupted 3.0 silk Lembert sutures for the outer layer and a running 3.0 polyglycolic acid suture for the transmural inner layer .
For two-layer anastomoses ,  three packets of 3.0 silk sutures ,  each containing five needled sutures ,  and two packets of 3.0 polyglycolic acid sutures were used .
The two-layer interrupted anastomosis has its origins in the early 19th century through the experimental work of Travers and of Lembert ,  who advocated careful approximation of the serosal surfaces of the bowel and devised a method of suturing to accomplish this .
In 1836 ,  Dieffenbach performed the fist successful anastomosis of the small intestine using Lemberts method .
The present study demonstrates that a single-layer continuous anastomosis is similar in terms of safety to the two-layer technique ,  but that it can be constructed in a significantly shorter time and at a lower cost .
Other traditional risk factors such as diabetes ,  steroids ,  anastomotic method ,  blood loss ,  and nutritional factors have not clearly been predictive of anastomotic failure .
Numerous studies in the literature comparing techniques (e.g. ,  one-layer vs. two-layer ,  hand-sewn vs. stapled ,  and end-to-end vs. end-to-side) have failed to demonstrate a clear superiority of one over another .
To accomplish a two-layer anastomosis ,  at least 1 cm of the serosal surface must be circumferentially cleared of mesentery ,  appendices epiploica ,  and omentum before beginning the anastomosis .
The senior authors of this paper (J.M.B. ,  E.E.M.) have used the single-layer technique exclusively for many years and can routinely perform an anastomosis in 8 to 10 minutes .
Even more dramatic is the difference in cost when compared with a stapled anastomosis ,  the disposable staple gun costs $115.26 and two refills cost an additional $123.54 ,  for a total of $238.80! .
In today’s cost-conscious environment ,  the use of staples for anastomoses seems irresponsible if a hand-sewn anastomosis can also be safely used in a similar time interval .
Although it did not quite reach statistical significance ,  it may be related to an intrinsic difference between the two methods ,  the single-layer anastomosis always has a larger lumen .
The apparent success of the single-layer continuous anastomosis may be attributed to several factors .
Although it is certainly possible to create an ischemic continuous anastomosis by applying too much tension while following the suture ,  Hautefeuille has argued that this is easier to avoid with a continuous suture because there is no point in the anastomosis where the bowel is completely devoid of its blood supply .
We conclude that the single-layer continuous anastomosis requires less time to construct and has a similar risk of leakage compared with the two-layer technique .
