ALTHOUGH MANY PATIENTS with carcinoma of the uterine cervix are cured with local measures ,  a substantial minority recur or present with metastases and are potential candidates for systemic therapy .
Unfortunately , the list of active drugs is short and combinations have not shown a consistent improvement over single agents .
Cisplatin is said to be the most active anticancer drug in cervical cancer ,  although 100 mg/m did not significantly improve the complete response (CR) rate compared prospectively with 50 mg/m (12.7 v 10% ,  respectively) and there was no appreciable difference in response duration ,  progression-free interval (PFI) ,  or survival.Thus ,  there is no convincing reason to use a cisplatindose higher than 50 mg/m .
Mitolactol (dibromodulcitol) is a hexitol derivative thatis converted into dianhydrogalactitol (DAG) in humanserum .
The principal toxicity of mitolactol is hematologic ,  while that of cisplatin is nonhematologic .
Ifosfamide is a new agent closely related to cyclophosphamide ,  but with less marrow toxicity and more bladder toxicity that requires concomitant use of the uroprotectormesna .
Treatment of cervix cancer with the combination of ifosfamide ,  cisplatin ,  and bleomycin yielded a 69% response rate (49 patients) in one series .
The result was impressive ,  but the importance of bleomycin was unclear and its toxicity sometimes troublesome ,  so we proposed to compare cisplatin alone versus a regimen of cisplatinplus mitolactol (C + M) and a regimen of cisplatin plusifosfamide (and mesna) (CIFX) .
Ineligible patients included those with cervical neoplasms other than squamous cell carcinoma or with nonmeasurable cervical cancer ,  WBC count less than 4,000/uL and/or platelet count less than 100,000/uL ,  abnormal liver function (bilirubin ,  AST ,  or alkaline phosphatase level > two times normal not related to the cancer) , bilateral hydronephrosis ,  GOG PS 3 or 4 ,  past or concomitant malignancy other than skin (excluding melanoma) ,  prior therapy with cytotoxic drugs except when used as a radiation sensitizer ,  radiationtherapy within 3 weeks of entry ,  lesions measurable only by ultrasound ,  or pregnancy or lactation .
Patients were prospectively stratified according to whether they had received prior radiation-sensitizer treatment (hydroxyurea ,  cisplatin , or fluorouracil) and by PS ,  and were then centrally randomized with equal probability to receive (1) cisplatin 50 mg/m with appropriate hydration every 3 weeks for a maximum of six courses ,  or (2) cisplatin 50 mg/m on day 1 plus mitolactol (180 mg/m orally for 5 days) on days 2 through 6 every 3 weeks ,  or (3) cisplatin 50mg/m plus ifosfamide 5.0 g/m over 24 hours plus mesna 6 g/m given concurrently with ifosfamide and for 12 hours after ,  every 3 weeks ,  again for a maximum of six courses .
No subsequent treatment course was to begin until the WBC count was greater than 4,000/uL and the platelet count 100,000uL .
Therapy was to be delayed week by week until these levels were exceeded .
Dose adjustments were specified for hematologic ,  gastrointestinal ,  renal ,  and neurologic toxicity .
Toxicity was graded according to standard cooperative group criteria .
Ten patients did not receive the randomized study treatment .
Toxicity .
CNS toxicity ranged from confusion to somnolence to coma and/or seizures .
In all cases except one fatal case ,  CNS toxicity was reversible .
Subsequently ,  no fatal CNS toxicity was observed ,  but lesser degrees of encephalopathy continued to be observed more frequently on the CIFX arm .
The treatment arms were well balanced in this regard and there was no evidence that the treatment comparisons were distorted by this prior treatment .
Since the role of bleomycin in cervix cancer is unclear ,  but implies restricting therapy to patients with good pulmonary function ,  we elected not to include bleomycinin the present study .
A report that indicated mitolactol therapy of breast cancer was associated with myelodysplasia and secondary leukemias is of concern .
