TRIALS of postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer conducted during the 1960s and 1970s showed significant reductions in rates of locoregional recurrence but no improvement in overall survival .
Nevertheless ,  there are reasons to reconsider radiotherapy ,  including the limited value of adjuvant chemotherapy for bulky disease ,  a synergistic effect of chemotherapy plus radiation on residual locoregional tumor ,  and the possibility that eliminating bulky disease with radiation may improve the effect of chemotherapy ,  because chemotherapy may be more effective when the overall disease burden is low .
METHODS .
The mastectomy was performed according to standard surgical practice between 1979 and 1986 .
Chemotherapy .
The radiation therapy was administered between the fourth and fifth cycles of chemotherapy .
Sixteen daily treatments were delivered over a period of three to four weeks .
The mid-axilla received a dose of 35 Gy through an anterior supraclavicular–axillary field with a posterior axillary boost .
Also ,  as part of a second randomization ,  68 patients with estrogen-positive tumors were treated with radiationinduced ovarian ablation that included 20 Gy over a period of five days plus prednisone (7.5 mg per day) for two years ,  as described by Meakin et al. Among these 68 patients ,  33 were assigned to chemotherapy and 35 were assigned to chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
Study Groups .
In the group treated with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy ,  79 of 164 patients had recurrences — locoregional ,  systemic ,  or both — as compared with 97 of 154 patients in the group given chemotherapy alone .
These values translate into an overall reduction of 33 percent in the rate of recurrence of breast cancer (relative risk ,  0.67 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.50 to 0.90 ,  P 0.007) ,  with an improvement of 17 percentage points in disease-free survival at the 15-year followup (Fig. 1) .
Mortality from breast cancer was reduced by 29 percent in the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group (relative risk ,  0.71 ,  95 percent confidence interval , 0.51 to 0.99 ,  P 0.05) ,  with 62 deaths ,  as compared with 76 in the chemotherapy-only group ,  which represented an improvement of 10 percentage points in breast-cancer–specific survival (Fig. 3) .
DISCUSSION .
There was no excess mortality we could attribute to the long-term side effects of radiotherapy .
It is possible that we will see additional benefit in overall survival ,  because at this writing 19 patients in the chemotherapy group remain alive with systemic recurrence ,  as compared with only 9 in the combined-treatment group ,  most of these 28 patients are expected to die of breast cancer .
Therefore ,  the metaanalyses of previous studies may not be relevant to current practice .
There are at least nine reported randomized trials comparing the combined treatment with chemotherapy alone .
The elimination of locoregional cancer cells by radiotherapy added to adjuvant chemotherapy may reduce mortality in selected patients with breast cancer .
