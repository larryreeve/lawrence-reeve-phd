INTRODUCTION .
However ,  most series were nonrandomized and failed to achieve an improvement in long-term survival .
We also compared the toxicity of the two compared groups after planned treatment .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Trial Design .
The trial compared the efficacy and tolerability of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer .
Patients .
Adequate hepatic ,  renal ,  and cardiopulmonary functions were essential .
Treatment Plan .
Toxicity of chemotherapy was assessed before each course .
Study End Point .
Statistical Considerations .
Differences in survival rates were assessed by the log-rank test .
RESULTS .
Among them ,  60 patients were randomized to the concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy ,  62 were randomized to the radiotherapy alone .
Patient characteristics were well balanced between the compared groups .
Toxicity .
All these acute toxicities were successfully treated with conservative management ,  except one death related to neutropenic sepsis after chemoradiotherapy .
No treatment-related deaths occurred in the radiotherapy group .
Failure Patterns .
Survival and Disease-Free .
DISCUSSION .
Radiation effects are dependent on well-oxygenated tumor cells .
In theory ,  bulky tumors have significant hypoxic cell populations that are relatively radioresistant .
However ,  most of these results were nonrandomized and were based on a small sample size .
Computerized tomography lacks sensitivity for identifying micrometastasis outside the pelvic radiation therapy field .
This finding has been associated with occult extrapelvic disease .
Indeed ,  in our trial ,  the treatment-related toxicity was severe and resulted in delayed radiotherapy in 15% of patients after chemoradiotherapy ,  in which 77.8% of patients with treatment delays recurred or died of disease .
The incidence of acute and late complications encountered in our series was higher than anticipated .
Chemotherapy could also lead to an accelerated regrowth of surviving clonogens .
Such trials are currently underway .
