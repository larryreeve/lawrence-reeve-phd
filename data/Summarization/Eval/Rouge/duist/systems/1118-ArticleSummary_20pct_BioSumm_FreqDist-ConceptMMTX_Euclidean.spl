INTRODUCTION .
This is associated with a high incidence of distant metastasis ,  in which 30% of patients subsequently developed metastases either alone or in combination with pelvic failure .
The use of concurrent chemoradiotherapy has shown promising therapeutic results in a variety of tumors .
The purpose of this randomized trial was to assess whether the chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone for locally advanced cervical carcinoma .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Trial Design .
The trial compared the efficacy and tolerability of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer .
A total of 122 patients with advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix were included in this study .
Adequate hepatic ,  renal ,  and cardiopulmonary functions were essential .
Any enlarged or suspicious nodes were excised and sent for histopathologic interpretation .
Treatment Plan .
This was followed by six courses of intracavitary brachytherapy 1 to 2 weeks after external beam radiotherapy was completed .
All adverse effects and laboratory abnormalities for chemotherapy were graded according to the toxicity criteria of the Gynecologic Oncology Group .
Statistical Considerations .
Comparisons of variables between groups were based on the x2 test .
A total of 122 patients with advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix were entered and all were eligible for follow-up evaluation .
Among them ,  60 patients were randomized to the concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy ,  62 were randomized to the radiotherapy alone .
Patient characteristics were well balanced between the compared groups .
Among them ,  interrupted radiotherapy with delayed treatment because of treatment-related toxicity was observed in 9 cases .
A review of the reasons for these unscheduled interruptions of therapy revealed that 8 were due to hematological toxicity ,  and 1 was due to elevated GOT and GPT .
Of the radiotherapy group ,  60 patients completed radiotherapy with no delays of treatment for toxicity ,  whereas the planned radiotherapy was interrupted for 1 week in 2 patients because of radiation protitis or neutropenia .
However ,  there was no difference in completeness between concurrent group and radiotherapy group (96.7% versus 100% ,  P = 0.24) .
Additionally ,  there was also no difference in the incidence of distant failure between the chemoradiotherapy group and the radiotherapy group (21.6% versus 29% ,  P Å 0.47) .
DISCUSSION .
Radiation effects are dependent on well-oxygenated tumor cells .
The problem of enhanced pelvic control cannot be approached simply by increasing radiation doses because of the additional complications produced by conventional radiation .
This drug has also been shown to be a radiosensitizer in vitro and in vivo with documented activity in squamous cell carcinoma .
However ,  most of these results were nonrandomized and were based on a small sample size .
This finding has been associated with occult extrapelvic disease .
Some authors have reported that clonogen repopulation in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region accelerates after radiotherapy .
Such trials are currently underway .
