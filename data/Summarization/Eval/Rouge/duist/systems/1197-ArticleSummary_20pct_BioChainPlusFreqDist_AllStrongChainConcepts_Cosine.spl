Patients between 18 and 65 years of age with grade 3 to 4 spindle-cell sarcomas (primary diameter >= 5 cm or any size recurrent tumor) in extremities or girdles were eligible .
Stratification was by primary versus recurrent tumors and by tumor diameter greater than or equal to 10 cm versus less than 10 cm. One hundred four patients were randomized ,  51 to the control group and 53 to the treatment group (five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin 60 mg/m2 days 1 and 2 and ifosfamide 1.8 g/m2 days 1 through 5 ,  with hydration ,  mesna ,  and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) .
The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 48 months in the treatment group and 16 months in the control group (P = .04) ,  and the median overall survival (OS) was 75 months for treated and 46 months for untreated patients (P = .03) .
The treatment of limb sarcomas mainly relies on a combined-modality approach ,  after the demonstration that pre-or postoperative radiation and conservative surgery led to local control in a high proportion of patients.4 In fact ,  limb-sparing procedures allow an 85% to 90% local dis-ease-free survival (DFS) rate and demolitive surgery now represents only 5% to 10% of the operations in comparison with the 50% survival rate of the 1960s to 1970s .
Not one new study has been already reported ,  whereas the present Italian co-operative study closed patient accrual in November 1996 because of the results of the planned interim analysis .
After a positive biopsy for sarcoma ,  all patients underwent complete staging and programmed local treatment .
The patients who satisfied all the selection criteria were then stratified and subsequently randomized to a control or chemotherapy group .
Inclusion criteria were as follows ,  age ,  18 to 65 years ,  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2 ,  primary tumors subfascially localized with diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm ,  high-grade spindle-cell or polymorphous sarcomas (fibrosarcoma ,  malignant fibrous histiocytoma ,  polymorphous liposarcoma ,  leiomyosarcoma ,  synovial sarcoma ,  malignant schwannoma ,  angiosarcoma ,  and polymorphous rhabdomyosarcoma) ,  local relapse of any size ,  no previous radio/chemotherapy ,  adequate bone marrow (WBC count of >= 4,000/fiL ,  platelets = 120.000/mL ,  and hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL) ,  renal (creatinine <= 1.3 mg/dL) ,  hepatic (SGOT <= 2.5 X normal value and bilirubin <= 1.2 mg/dL) ,  and pulmonary functions .
Patients were treated with radical surgery ,  wide resection followed by postoperative radiation therapy ,  or pre-operative radiation therapy .
Chemotherapy ,  repeated every 3 weeks ,  consisted of five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin (EPI) 60 mg/m2/die ,  in a short intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1 and 2 (total dose per cycle ,  120 mg/m2) ,  IFO 1.8 g/m2/die diluted in 500 mL of normal saline and administered over 1 hour on days 1 through 5 (total dose per cycle ,  9 g/m2) ,  and 6-mercapto-ethansulfonate in a bolus IV injection at 20% of the IFO dose ,  given before and 4 and 8 hours after the IFO infusions .
Physical examinations ,  routine chemistry ,  and x-ray of the thorax and bones underlying the primary site were performed every 2 months and a CT scan of the thorax was performed every 6 months for the first 2 years .
A difference of P <= .001 (two sided) in DFS between the two groups was considered sufficient to stop patient accrual .
All centers faxed protocol-specific eligibility checklists to the statistics office in Aviano ,  patients were stratified using a four-block stratification by primary tumor (diameter < 10 cm v >= 10 cm) and recurrent tumor (diameter < 10 cm v >= 10 cm) and randomized to treatment or control groups .
The study period was calculated from randomization to the first occurrence of the considered events (local recurrence alone ,  metastasis with or without local recurrence ,  death due to disease ,  toxic death) .
Overall DFS was defined as the time between randomization and the first recurrence ,  and OS was defined as the time between randomization and death as a result of disease (patients dying in complete remission were considered as censored on the date of death for OS) .
However ,  the median diameter is the same in the two groups ,  and the difference in range is caused by a small number (three patients) of large tumors in the control group .
Radical surgery was performed in 36 patients (35%) ,  27 of whom underwent amputation because of massive local extension and/or distal presentation ,  the other nine had conservative radical surgery .
The remaining 68 patients (65%) were treated using a limb-sparing procedure involving radiation therapy and surgery ,  45 underwent surgery and postoperative radiation therapy ,  and 24 underwent preoperative radiation therapy and conservative surgery (Table 1) .
Seven patients (13%) did not start adjuvant treatment .
The median time between surgery and the start of chemotherapy was 62 days (range ,  8 to 187 days) ,  in the three cases with early metastases ,  the time intervals between surgery and relapse were 42 ,  74 ,  and 89 days .
One patient refused the fifth and last cycle for personal reasons ,  and three patients did not complete the treatment because of related toxicities (reappearance of viral uveitis ,  consecutive episodes of pneumonitis ,  and persistent leukopenia) after two ,  three ,  and four cycles ,  respectively .
The mean administered doses of the fifth cycle (94 mg of EPI and 8,156 mg of IFO) were slightly lower than those of the fourth cycle (95.5 mg of EPI and 8,257 mg of IFO) .
At the time of statistical analysis (November 1999) ,  the median follow-up for the 104 patients included in the study was 59 months ,  61 months in the treatment arm and 55 months in the control arm .
Univariate analyses did not reveal any statistically significant difference in overall DFS and OS for any of the characteristics considered (age ,  sex ,  center of surgery ,  histology ,  grading ,  site of primary tumor ,  presentation ,  diameter ,  local treatment ,  and stratification) with the exception of adjuvant treatment (data not shown) .
In four patients ,  the first event was a synchronous local relapse with metastases (one patient in the control arm and three patients in the treatment arm) .
Furthermore ,  nine patients developed metachronous relapse at a different site (three were local relapse after a metastasis and six were distant relapses after a previous local relapse) .
The median overall DFS was 48 months among treated patients and 16 months in the control group .
Patients in the treated arm experienced a 41% reduction in the risk of disease relapse (HR ,  0.59 ,  95% CI ,  0.36 to 0.99 ,  P = .04) (Fig 2) .
Overall ,  13 patients had a local recurrence of disease as the first relapse without simultaneous distant metastases (four patients in the treatment arm and nine patients in the control arm ,  Table 4) .
Four patients had local relapses simultaneously with metastasis (one patient in the control arm and three in the treatment arm) ,  and another three patients developed a local relapse as the second relapse after a distant metastasis (two patients in the treatment arm and one patient in the control arm) .
Taking into account the overall local relapse rate (all local events observed) ,  11 patients in the control group and nine in the treatment group experienced local failure .
The distribution between the different local treatment modalities (radical surgery ,  surgery and postoperative radiation therapy ,  and preoperative radiation therapy and surgery) was respectively ,  two of 16 patients ,  seven of 20 ,  and two of 15 for the control group and three of 20 patients ,  six of 24 ,  and zero of nine for the treatment group .
Six additional patients (four in the control arm and two in the treatment arm) had a distant metastasis as a second relapse after a local relapse .
The preliminary data of previous studies were sometimes positive for DFS and OS , 15-19 but further analyses ,  made after an adequate follow-up time ,  indicated a disappearance of the positive effect of chemotherapy on 20,21 and ,  in some cases ,  worse results.22 However ,  the recently published meta-analysis , 7 involving 1,568 patients ,  showed a statistically significant benefit for treated patients of 6% ,  10% ,  and 10% for local ,  metastatic ,  and overall DFS ,  respectively ,  and a favorable (but not statistically significant) trend in OS (4%) ,  after a median of 9.4 years of follow-up .
Furthermore ,  in the subgroup of 886 patients  affected by extremity sarcomas ,  the difference in OS between treated and untreated patients was significant (P = .029) ,  and the absolute benefit after 10 years increased to 7% .
It is directly derived from consecutive phase I-II dose-intensification trials carried out at the Centro di Riferimento Oncologico of Aviano.27,31 The epirubicin dose level of 60 mg/m2 X 2 days represents the step before the maximum-tolerated dose established in those trials (70 mg/m2 epirubicin X 2 days) when given in combination with fixed full doses of ifosfamide (1.8 g/m2/d X 5 days) in advanced cases of soft tissue sarcoma .
A difference of P = .001 (two sided) in DFS between the two groups was considered sufficient to stop patient accrual .
Questions regarding the adequacy of the surgical approach and consequently the adequacy of margins could be raised ,  but only 10 patients were treated outside of referral centers and only two of those patients had local relapses .
Although a few second-generation trials are still going on ,  this study is the first to be concluded (November 1996) ,  having stopped the patient accrual according to a predefined statistical methodology .
