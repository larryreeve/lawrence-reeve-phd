OF the estimated 13,700 women in the United States in whom invasive cervical cancer was diagnosed in 1998 ,  nearly 5000 will ultimately die of the disease because of the inadequacies of current treatment .
We report the first results of this study .
METHODS .
Patients .
Patients were required to understand the trial and provide written informed consent .
Treatment .
Two additional cycles of chemotherapy were scheduled at three-week intervals .
Follow-up .
Quality Control .
Statistical Analysis .
Death from any cause was considered a failure in the analysis .
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate both survival rates .
Log-rank tests were used to compare treatments .
To detect such a difference ,  we predicted that we would need to enroll 400 women in the study over a four-year period and then follow them for an additional four years .
RESULTS .
Characteristics of the Patients .
There were no significant differences in these characteristics between the groups .
Treatment and Compliance .
The median total duration of radiation was 58 days ,  with a mean dose of 89 Gy delivered to point A in each group .
Four patients refused or were unable to receive ny chemotherapy but were included in the analysis according to the intention to treat .
Side Effects .
Hematologic effects were generally moderate .
Outcome .
The median duration of follow-up was 43 months .
Approximately 70 percent of the patients assigned to each group had stage IB ,  IIA ,  or IIB disease .
For these patients ,  overall survival was significantly better if they were treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
DISCUSSION .
The role of prophylactic extended-field radiation has always been controversial .
The acute side effects were severe ,  possibly because of the addition of chemotherapy or the altered regimen of fractionation .
