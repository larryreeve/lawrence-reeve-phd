Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. leukocyte count >3.0 x 10/L ,  platelet count > 100 x 10/L and adequate renal function (scrum creatinine <90 umol/L or creatinine clearance > 1.0 mL/sec) were required .
Patients received oral or IV bicarbonate to ensure a urine pH of at least 7.0 at the time of MTX administration and for 24 hours thereafter ,  then oral folinic acid rescue (FAR) for eight doses of 15 mg each 6 hours commencing 24 hours after the MTX .
Among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  disease stage expressed as TNM separately and as stage grouping ,  using standard definitions of the American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging and- End Result reporting were also examined as possible prognostic factors for response and survival .
This was most extreme among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  of this subgroup 65% responded to the sequence of MF ,  while 39% of entered patients including 47% of those evaluable for response ,  responded to the reverse FM sequence (P = .18 ,  Fisher's exact test) .
Cox model multivariate analysis showed that ECOG performance status at study entry was the most significant prognostic factor for survival duration (P < .001) ,  and that ,  among the 70 patients with head and neck cancer ,  when allowance was made for performance status ,  a survival difference in favor of the "reverse" FM sequence emerged (P < .025) .
