INTRODUCTION .
Over the past several decades ,  the prognosis of patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix has been poor ,  particularly for those with bulky local tumors and extensive parametrial extension .
The treatment of choice for advanced cervical carcinoma has traditionally been radiotherapy alone .
The incidence of failure to control pelvic disease following radical irradiation is about 40% .
This is associated with a high incidence of distant metastasis ,  in which 30% of patients subsequently developed metastases either alone or in combination with pelvic failure .
While no therapy has been proven more effective than radical external-beam plus intracavitary radiotherapy ,  considerable research effort ,  including addition of chemotherapy plus radiation ,  is currently being put into improving survival rate in patients with advanced carcinoma of the cervix .
The rationale for adding chemotherapy to pelvic radiation is to provide systemic cytotoxic agents active against cervical cancer with the potential to enhance the radiosensitivity ,  to enhance local tumor control ,  and to eradicate micrometastasis .
Recently ,  a variety of studies have investigated how chemotherapy may be integrated into the management of patients with advanced cervical cancer .
The use of concurrent chemoradiotherapy has shown promising therapeutic results in a variety of tumors .
The concurrent use of radiation and chemotherapy ,  either as a single agent or in combination ,  has also been demonstrated to be effective in the local control of advanced carcinoma of the cervix with acceptable toxicity as presented by several reports ,  and was also supported by our previous phase I and II trial .
However ,  most series were nonrandomized and failed to achieve an improvement in long-term survival .
Therefore ,  to further test the hypothesis ,  a definitive statement about the optimal management in this situation required a prospective ,  randomized trial .
Thus ,  we designed the randomized trial to compare the tumor response and survival rate of patients with advanced cervical carcinoma receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus patients receiving radiotherapy alone .
The purpose of this randomized trial was to assess whether the chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone for locally advanced cervical carcinoma .
We also compared the toxicity of the two compared groups after planned treatment .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Trial Design .
This study was designed as a randomized ,  phase III trial conducted at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan .
From October 1990 to April 1995 ,  patients with advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix were entered on the study and randomly assigned to either radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy .
Before randomization ,  patients were stratified by stage (stage IIb bulky versus stage IIIB) .
The trial compared the efficacy and tolerability of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer .
Patients .
A total of 122 patients with advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix were included in this study .
Patients with previously untreated stage IIb bulky or stage IIIb advanced cervical carcinoma were eligible for study .
Other eligibility criteria consisted of a pathologically verified squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix ,  a Karnofsky performance status index of 80% or above ,  and an age of younger than 70 years .
Patients with stage IIB tumors had to have bulky tumors larger than 4 cm and extensive parametrial invasion .
The patients could have no history of previous malignancy ,  chemotherapy ,  or radiotherapy .
Adequate hepatic ,  renal ,  and cardiopulmonary functions were essential .
Informed consents were obtained from all patients ,  and the study protocol was approved by the Protocol Committee of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital .
The disease was staged according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) in 1991 .
Pretreatment evaluation included a complete medical history and physical examination ,  complete blood count ,  serum electrolytes ,  chemistry profile ,  tumor markers ,  chest X ray ,  an electrocardiogram ,  and contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis .
