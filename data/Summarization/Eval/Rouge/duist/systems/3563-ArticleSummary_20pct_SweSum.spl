Intestinal anastomosis has been successfully performed for more than 150 years using a variety of techniques ,  materials ,  and devices .
Of these ,  the method that has proven successful in most situations and in the hands of most surgeons has been the two-layer anastomosis using interrupted silk sutures for an outer inverted seromuscular layer and a running absorbable suture for a transmural inner layer .
Recently ,  several reports have appeared advocating a single-layer continuous anastomosis using monofilament plastic suture .
All adult patients requiring intestinal anastomosis at Denver Health Medical Center from September 1996 to September 1999 were considered eligible .
Patients requiring gastrointestinal anastomosis were excluded because of the presumably increased risk of hemorrhage from the stomach .
All single-layer anastomoses were constructed using a continuous 3.0 polypropylene double-needle suture that began at the mesenteric border (Fig .
To avoid ischemia of the anastomosis ,  the surgeon had to ensure that only enough pressure was applied to the suture while following to approximate the ends of the bowel and render the anastomosis watertight .
Calculations of the cost of materials were based on the actual hospital costs for the suture material and the standardized utilization of suture material by the surgeons .
For two-layer anastomoses ,  three packets of 3.0 silk sutures ,  each containing five needled sutures ,  and two packets of 3.0 polyglycolic acid sutures were used .
Each packet of silk sutures cost $9.41 ,  and each packet of polyglycolic acid suture cost $1.88. For single-layer anastomoses ,  one package of double-needled 3.0 polypropylene suture was used .
Each packet of polypropylene suture cost $4.61. Continuous data were analyzed using the Student t test .
For six patients who required more than one anastomosis ,  the same method was used for each anastomosis .
Anastomotic leaks ,  intraabdominal abscesses ,  length of time required for anastomosis ,  length of stay ,  and material costs are shown for both groups in Table 2. In 1836 ,  Dieffenbach performed the fist successful anastomosis of the small intestine using Lemberts method .
The single-layer continuous anastomosis is a contemporary innovation first described by Hautefeuille in 1976. Another factor is related to the properties of a continuous monofilament plastic suture line .
Although it is certainly possible to create an ischemic continuous anastomosis by applying too much tension while following the suture ,  Hautefeuille has argued that this is easier to avoid with a continuous suture because there is no point in the anastomosis where the bowel is completely devoid of its blood supply .
For these reasons ,  we believe the single-layer continuous anastomosis is superior to the two-layer interrupted technique .
