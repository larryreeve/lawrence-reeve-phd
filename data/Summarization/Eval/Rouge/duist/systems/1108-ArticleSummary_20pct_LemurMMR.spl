four were subsequently excluded after a central review by the pathology committee found that the specimen was inadequate for evaluation in the case of one patient the primary lesion had been misidentified in the case of one patient the cell type had been misidentified in the case of one patient and the stage of the tumor had been overestimated in the case of one patient 
the american joint committee on cancer and the international federation of gynecology and obstetrics define stage ib cervical cancer as invasive cancer that is confined to the cervix with a depth of more than 5 mm and a width of more than 7 mm in patients with large stage ib cervical cancers local control and survival are poorer than in patients with smaller stage i cancers whether treated by surgery or irradiation 
therefore because of the large difference in outcome between the two groups and the similarity in the rates of progression free survival and survival within each group this analysis is the final analysis of survival 
in the earlier gynecologic oncology group study that assessed the value of extrafascial hysterectomy after radiotherapy surgery was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of relapses in the pelvic region but the overall risk of recurrence was not significantly reduced relative risk 0 76 95 percent confidence interval 0 52 to 1 12 and there was no significant difference in survival relative risk of death 0 91 
forty nine of the patients in the group given radiotherapy alone died of cervical cancer 26 percent as compared with 27 of the patients in the group given radiotherapy and cisplatin 15 percent table 4 
the design called for a final analysis when 56 events recurrences or deaths had occurred in patients receiving the control regimen radiotherapy alone and provided the study with a statistical power of 80 percent with use of the log rank test and a one sided significance level of 0 05 
the first stopping rule was chosen to reject the null hypothesis at the 1 percent level whereas the second was chosen so that the level of rejection for both interim tests was 2 percent 
otherwise compliance with radiotherapy with respect to the dose the volume and the total treatment was good and was similar between the two groups table 2 
the dose to point a a reference location 2 cm lateral and 2 cm superior to the cervical os was 30 gy for a cumulative dose of 75 gy and the cumulative dose to point b the pelvic wall was 55 gy 
it is reasonable to conclude on the basis of these results and our results that the elimination of hysterectomy from both regimens would not have affected the increase in survival associated with the use of cisplatin 
at the time of this analysis 69 patients in the group receiving the control regimen had had a recurrence of disease and 49 had died 88 percent of the number of deaths needed for a final analysis of survival 
the cox model was used to evaluate the difference between treatment regimens adjust for prognostic factors and estimate the relative likelihood and 95 percent confidence intervals of survival and progression free survival 
two scheduled interim analyses were conducted during the enrollment phase of the trial the first was conducted after 29 recurrences had been reported and the second after 47 recurrences had been reported 
cox multiple regression analysis showed that the size of the tumor as assessed by physical examination and the histologic grade of the tumor were both significant prognostic factors 
the threeyear survival rates were 74 percent in the group given radiotherapy alone and 83 percent in the combined therapy group p 0 008 by the log rank test fig 2 
survival was calculated from the date of entry into the study to the date of death or the last follow up visit 
progression free survival was calculated from the date of entry into the study to the date of disease recurrence death or the last follow up visit 
the recognition in some centers that patients with bulky stage ib cancers had higher rates of recurrent disease within the cervical area led to the inclusion of adjuvant extrafascial hysterectomy in the treatment regimen for these women 
the effect of these two drugs in combination with radiotherapy was compared with the effect of hydroxyurea and radiotherapy in a randomized phase 3 trial by the gynecologic oncology group involving patients with cervical cancer of stages iib through iva unpublished data 
they compared treatment with radiation and hydroxyurea treatment with radiation and weekly cisplatin and treatment with radiation and hydroxyurea cisplatin and fluorouracil and found that the rate of relapse free survival was significantly higher in both regimens containing cisplatin 
in our trial the only difference in the protocols for the two groups was the use of weekly infusions of cisplatin during radiotherapy for bulky stage ib cervical cancers 
at the time of this analysis the rate of progression free survival was significantly higher among patients in the combined therapy group p 0 001 by the log rank test fig 1 
pelvic radiation was delivered with the four field technique with x ray accelerators of at least 4 mv photons at a distance of at least 100 cm the treatment field was set to extend 3 cm beyond the known extent of disease and to encompass iliac and lower common iliac lymph nodes 
more patients in the group given radiotherapy alone refused to undergo the operation nine vs five in the combined therapy group and more patients in this group also had an early recurrence eight vs two 
the difference between groups in survival and progression free survival was evaluated with use of the logrank test according to the intention to treat principle 
the radiation therapy oncology group study whose results appear elsewhere in this issue of the journal compared pelvic and para aortic radiotherapy with pelvic radiotherapy in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil in patients with clinical stage ib through iva cervical cancer 
all our patients had cervical cancers of at least 4 cm in diameter and the distribution of the tumors according to size was similar in the two treatment groups 
in 1992 when the current study was initiated complete data on survival in the earlier trial were not available but an early analysis showed a significantly lower rate of relapses in the pelvic region among women who underwent hysterectomy
