Because of these potential advantages ,  we hypothesized that the single-layer technique could be introduced into our surgical teaching program with no increase in anastomotic failure and that it could be performed in less time than the two-layer technique .
METHODS .
Patients requiring gastrointestinal anastomosis were excluded because of the presumably increased risk of hemorrhage from the stomach .
Patients were also excluded if the surgeon did not believe that either technique could be used because of technical concerns such as edema or scarring .
Patients were assigned to either the one-or two-layer technique in a prospective ,  randomized fashion .
Opaque ,  sealed envelopes indicating the technique to be used were placed in the operating room and were drawn sequentially when the need for intestinal anastomosis became apparent .
Each stitch was advanced approximately 5 mm. To avoid ischemia of the anastomosis ,  the surgeon had to ensure that only enough pressure was applied to the suture while following to approximate the ends of the bowel and render the anastomosis watertight .
For six patients who required more than one anastomosis ,  the same method was used for each anastomosis .
This resulted in 65 single-layer continuous and 67 two-layer interrupted anastomoses .
Since then ,  the technique has remained essentially unchanged except for the evolution of suture material for the inner layer .
The single-layer interrupted anastomosis was never entirely abandoned and has periodically attracted renewed interest .
The single-layer continuous anastomosis is a contemporary innovation first described by Hautefeuille in 1976 .
These results also imply that the technique can be safely introduced into a surgical training program without a painful learning curve .
Ischemia ,  tension on the anastomosis ,  and poor technique are clearly responsible for anastomotic failure and are all under the direct control of the surgeon .
In fact ,  the only technique that has been unequivocally demonstrated to be unacceptable is the everted anastomosis .
This time has been documented by other surgeons using the single-layer continuous method .
In contrast ,  it is difficult for an experienced surgeon to create a two-layer anastomosis in less than 20 to 25 minutes .
In today’s cost-conscious environment ,  the use of staples for anastomoses seems irresponsible if a hand-sewn anastomosis can also be safely used in a similar time interval .
The apparent success of the single-layer continuous anastomosis may be attributed to several factors .
For these reasons ,  we believe the single-layer continuous anastomosis is superior to the two-layer interrupted technique .
