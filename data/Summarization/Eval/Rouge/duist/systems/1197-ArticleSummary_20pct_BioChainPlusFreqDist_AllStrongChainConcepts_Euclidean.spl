Results .
Therefore ,  our data favor an intensified treatment in similar cases .
However ,  the vast majorities arise from the extra-osseous and subcutaneous soft tissue of the limbs .
Their natural history is partially known and clinical decisions rely on a few simple and well-recognized prognostic factors such as size ,  grading ,  and location .
Nevertheless ,  a great proportion of high-risk soft tissue sarcoma patients develop distant metastases during their lives .
The first generation of randomized adjuvant trials have recently been reviewed and a meta-analysis performed on the basis of updated patient records .
Study Design and Staging .
Treatment started after the completion of any local treatment and/or as soon as the wound had healed (Fig 1) .
Selection Criteria .
Adjuvant Treatment .
Univariate analyses to study the association between these end points and pathologic factors were based on the same estimator ,  whereas the Cox’s proportional hazard model13 was used for multivariate analyses .
The intensities of local recurrences and of distant (with or without simultaneous local) recurrences were estimated by the cumulative incidence function (CIF) approach to the analysis of competing risks.14 The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to test the hypothesis of equality of the distribution of some covariates in the two treatment groups .
RESULTS .
The present article deals with a minimum observation time of 36 months calculated from the date of randomization of the last patient (11 of 96) .
Overall ,  the distribution of diameters in the two groups was similar and the Wilcoxon statistical test did not reject the hypothesis that they were equal (P = .19) .
Twenty-four percent of the cycles were delayed for toxicity or for nonmedical reasons ,  in the majority of these cases (16%) ,  the delay was shorter than 1 week and can be attributed to logistic problems rather than to toxicity .
The first cycle was administered at a dose less than or equal to 50% in one patient and less than or equal to 75% in another six patients based on nonprotocol medical decisions .
There was a subsequent slight and constant decrease in the administered doses of mainly EPI ,  which was in accordance with the predefined reduction scheme and testifies to the aggressiveness of the program .
Prophylactic oral antibiotics were given in an additional eight cases .
Follow-Up Data .
Sixty first events (local ,  distant only ,  and synchronous distant and local) were observed overall (32 in the control arm and 28 in the treatment arm) .
In four patients ,  the first event was a synchronous local relapse with metastases (one patient in the control arm and three patients in the treatment arm) .
Furthermore ,  nine patients developed metachronous relapse at a different site (three were local relapse after a metastasis and six were distant relapses after a previous local relapse) .
Additional relapses at the same site after an adequate treatment are not reported .
As the first event ,  a total of 47 distant relapses were observed (22 single distant events in the control group and 21 in the treatment group ,  one synchronous distant and local event in the control group and three in the treatment group Table 4) .
Adjuvant treatment of localized soft tissue sarcomas is controversial because no sufficient and convincing data are available .
Furthermore ,  a number of other points about the first-generation studies evaluated by the meta-analysis should be discussed .
Although these first-generation trials are no longer the gold standards ,  the meta-analysis did reveal a number of elements that suggested a positive role of adjuvant chemotherapy .
These developments created new interest in the use of dose-intensification for advanced disease27-31 and the planning of new trials of adjuvant treatment .
The regimen used in the present study represents the highest dose-intensity ever tried in an adjuvant setting for soft tissue sarcomas .
This P value was reached ,  and the protocol was closed .
Furthermore ,  the Rizzoli Institute had already published a positive adjuvant trial17,18 and the risk of undertreating a great number of patients was a concern .
The outcome results at 4 years revealed a 23% overall local relapse ,  with a trend in favor of the treatment group .
This unfavorable local behaviour is mainly because of the dimension of local disease ,  in our opinion .
However ,  between the three different local approaches there was a trend in favor of preoperative radiation therapy (two local relapse of 24 patients in the control arm ,  8.3%) .
Moreover ,  this treatment option5,32,33 was chosen for those patients presenting with locally far-advanced disease or with disease approaching critical structures (nerves and vessels) ,  therefore a high incidence of local relapse could be foreseen .
The present trial deals with data obtained at a median follow-up time of 59 months and 36 months after last randomization .
We think that these data are mature enough to be reported on ,  and we look forward to being able to describe definitive results in a future report based on 10 years of median follow-up .
Adjuvant treatment of soft tissue sarcomas is still strongly debated35,36 ,  despite 14 published trials and one meta-analysis performed on 1,568 randomized patients .
