INTRODUCTION .
Radical external beam plus intracavitary radiation continues to be the standard therapy for advanced cervical cancer to which all new therapies must be compared .
While this treatment is relatively effective in small volume tumors ,  tumor control and survival decline as the bulk of pelvic disease and FIGO stage advance .
Overall 5-year survival rates are reported for stage IIB cancers between 50 and 80% and from 25 to 50% for stage III .
No substantial improvements have beenmade in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer in the past two decades .
An analysis of the patterns of failure after radiation therapy in locally advanced cervical cancer reveals that of those who recur over 70% have some component of pelvic failure as the first site of relapse and two-thirds develop some component of distant disease .
The problem of enhancing pelvic control and survival cannot be approached simply by increasing conventionally delivered radiation dose since late complications produced by radiation are at the upper limit of acceptability with currently employed doses .
The results reported for trials of neoadjuvant cisplatin-containing chemotherapy prior to radiation have been disappointing with six randomized trials ,  showing no advantage in local control or survival and possibly some detrimental effect .
Patients were randomized to receive either (a) standard external beam pelvic irradiation (EBRT) in a dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions defined at 100% versus ,  (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional intravenous 5-FU in a dose of 1 g/m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  (c) partially hyperfractionated RT ,  5280 cGy in 33 fractions ,  2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  or (d) arm (c) with the same infusional 5-FU .
The outcomes of interest in this study were pelvic control ,  survival ,  and disease-free survival ,  as well as the serious late complication rate .
Figure 1 demonstrates the study design ,  the four-arm study was designed to determine whether any significant differences in outcome were evident between arms (a) and (d) and to be explanatory with respect to causation .
Two factors were altered in arm (d) compared to standard arm (a) ,  (1) the addition of 5-FU ,  (2) the change in radiation fractionation scheme .
If differences were to be observed in pelvic control and survival in arm (d) versus arm (a) ,  this could be due to a change in either or both factors .
Assuming that the magnitude and direction of the 5-FU effects were similar in arms (b) and (d) then the effect of the addition of 5-FU could be tested by comparing arms (b) and (d) with arms (a) and (c) .
The reduced fraction size in arms (c) and (d) was designed to attempt to take advantage of knowledge of the affect of fraction size on late complications and to determine whether complication rates were decreased by using decreased fraction size .
The effect of the fractionation was to be tested by comparing arms (c) and (d) with arms (a) and (b) (Fig. 1) .
In order to detect a 20% improvement in pelvic control rate from an expected 50% for arm (a) to 70% for arm (d) assuming an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.20 ,  73 patients in each of four treatment arms would be required for a total of 292 patients .
In order to detect an improvement of 15% in survival in arms (c) and (d) compared to that seen in arms (a) and (b) ,  assuming a 40% cause-specific survival rate in arm (a) and an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.2 ,  the total number of patients required was 272 .
The ‘‘Lifetest Procedure’’ in SAS UNIX was used to compare survival curves .
Cox’s proportional hazards model was used to examine the variables which might contribute to pelvic control or survival within stratum 1 .
In the ‘‘partially hyperfractionated RT with 5-FU arm’’ (d) ,  3 of 58 received nonprescribed doses of 46 Gy to 52 Gy in 29 to 32 fractions .
Of the 23 patients who received no intracavitary radiation or doses less than 500 cGy ,  there was a relatively even distribution across the treatment arms with 5 in arm (a) ,  5 in arm (b) ,  3 in arm (c) ,  and 9 in arm (d) .
Pelvic Control and Survival .
There is no significant difference in the overall 5-year disease-free survival between the treatment arms .
The disease free 5-year survival in arm (a) ,  (c) ,  (d) ,  and (b) ,  respectively , were 45 ,  53 ,  58 ,  and 61% .
The overall pelvic control by treatment assigned for arms (a) ,  (c) ,  (d) ,  and (b) was 58 ,  65 ,  68 ,  and 69% ,  respectively .
Whereas there was once again a trend in favor of concurrent 5-FU ,  particularly in combination with standard radiation ,  the difference was not statistically significant .
Similar differences were observed in pelvic control ,  but the addition of 5-FU to standard radiation resulted in a greater improvement in disease-free survival than in pelvic control .
In examining the effect of the addition of 5-FU on disease-free survival in stratum 1 ,  there is a highly significant difference in favor of the use of 5-FU regardless of the radiation employed .
However ,  in evaluating the importance of the contribution of the change in fractionation to the differences observed ,  there was no significant difference in the 5-year survival of those treated on standard radiation versus those treated with hyperfractionated irradiation whether or not 5-FU was used .
The 5-year Kaplan–Meier survival was 62% for those treated with hyperfractionated irradiation and was not significantly different from the 58% survival of those treated with standard irradiation .
The observed differences in pelvic control and survival in favor of the standard radiation and concurrent 5-FU associated with the addition of 5-FU rather than the change in radiation schedule .
Stratum 2 was examined for differences in pelvic control and survival between the treatment arms and no significant differences were observed .
Since significant differences in pelvic control and survival were observed in stratum 1 which contained only 99 patients ,  it is important to examine whether there was an uneven distribution of other possible patient or tumor-related prognostic factors across the treatment arms to account for the differences observed .
Patients were stratified into three groups in this study because pelvic control and survival outcomes are strongly influenced by the bulk of pelvic disease ,  declining with increasing bulk .
The specific strata selected were based on previous retrospective data indicating significantly different prognoses for these specific clinical groupings of bulk of pelvic disease .
The original design for this study required 292 patients with adequate power to detect a 15% difference in pelvic control and survival .
It is therefore not surprising that significant differences in survival and pelvic control were not observed in the overall population .
Within stratum 2 there was an improvement in pelvic control with the use of 5-FU but the difference was not statistically significant .
Because of the small numbers in each treatment arm it was surprising to observe a significant difference .
The overall incidence of serious complications was too low to detect differences between the treatment arms .
Two fractions of 160 cGy per day were delivered during the infusion at the beginning and end of treatment in arm (d) .
