However ,  among patients with a clinically early cancer ,  there are prognostic features which identify patients at increased risk for recurrence ,  recurrent cervical cancer after initial radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy has a poor prognosis ,  with a reported 5-year survival rate of 5% or less .
There have been multiple studies published which have retrospectively analyzed the outcome of patients at risk for recurrence who received adjuvant therapy compared to those patients not receiving adjuvant therapy .
In an effort to determine whether the improved survival in the Memorial Hospital Phase II trial was due to the combination of chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation therapy or due to the effect of the chemotherapy alone ,  a multicenter randomized Phase III clinical trial was designed .
Patients with clinical Stage IB–IIA cancer of the uterine cervix treated by radical hysterectomy ,  bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy ,  and aortic lymph node sampling were eligible for entry into this prospective study if they had one or more of the following risk factors ,  (1) metastatic disease to pelvic lymph nodes ,  (2) large primary tumors greater than or equal to 4 cm in diameter ,  (3) deeply invasive lesions with 75% or greater stromal invasion ,  (4) nonsquamous histology ,  and/or (5) occult parametrial involvement or positive surgical margins .
Following recovery from the second cycle of chemotherapy ,  patients received a course of whole pelvic radiation therapy to a dose of 45 Gy ,  delivered in 20 fractions via a four-field technique ,  patients did not receive intravaginal therapy .
In the second arm of the study ,  patients were randomized to treatment with a similar regimen of chemotherapy as described above without pelvic radiation ,  following the first two cycles of cisplatin and bleomycin ,  the patient then received the third and fourth treatment of cisplatin alone at 3-to 4-week intervals .
Seventy-five patients had a Stage IB cervical cancer risk factors and 64 had 1 to 2 risk factors ,  33 of these patients and the remaining 14 patients had a Stage IIA cancer .
Forty-five patients were randomized to the chemotherapy withdrawn by the institutional principal investigator due to plus radiation therapy treatment arm and 44 patients received poor medical condition of the patient (n ? 1) .
There were 12 major protocol viola-patients received only a portion of the proscribed treatment ,  tions ,  including 7 patients who were randomized (6 to che-one patient ,  randomized to chemotherapy ,  withdrew after chemotherapy plus radiation therapy and 1 patient to chemother-experiencing an allergic bleomycin reaction during the initial chemotherapy alone) and then either refused treatment (n ?6) or were infusion of bleomycin during cycle 1 .

Among patients with 3 or more risk factors ,  there was also no differ-The debate regarding the role of adjuvant therapy for paence in the disease-free survival or overall survival when tients at high risk for recurrence after radical hysterectomy compared to patients with 1–2 risk factors (Fig. 3) .
Major toxicity suggest that a 65% 5-year survival rate after therapy combinincluded one patient who did not receive the second cycle ing radical hysterectomy ,  pelvic lymphadenectomy ,  and of bleomycin due to the onset of pulmonary symptoms and postoperative pelvic radiotherapy for patients with pelvic a significant decrease in pulmonary function compared to a lymph node metastases is an improvement compared to his-pretreatment study .
Killackey et al. reported no recurrences among 22 patients with cervical cancer at high risk after radical hysterectomy utilizing a similar treatment regimen consisting of chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation therapy .
Tattersall et al. were unable to demonstrate a difference in disease-free or overall survival in 71 patients randomized to either pelvic radiation versus chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation after radical hysterectomy for Stage IB–IIA cervical cancer .
The risk factors did not appear to be additive ,  since the disease-free and overall survival were similar when patients with 1–2 risk factors were compared to those patients with 3 or more risk factors .
