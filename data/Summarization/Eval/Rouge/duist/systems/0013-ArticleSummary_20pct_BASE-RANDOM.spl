Mitolactol (dibromodulcitol) is a hexitol derivative thatis converted into dianhydrogalactitol (DAG) in humanserum .
The combination of DAG and cisplatin has previously been studied .
Nevertheless ,  the possibility existed that the combination ,  with two CRs and five PRs (39% response rate) ,  produced improved results .
Although an intermediate dose level (50 mg/m cisplatin and 225mg/m mitolactol daily for 5 days) was considered ,  it wasnot pursued ,  since six of 10 patients at the first dose level in the pilot study required dose reductions and/or delays with re-treatment .
The result was impressive ,  but the importance of bleomycin was unclear and its toxicity sometimes troublesome ,  so we proposed to compare cisplatin alone versus a regimen of cisplatinplus mitolactol (C + M) and a regimen of cisplatin plusifosfamide (and mesna) (CIFX) .
Lesions measurable by physical examination or chest x-ray were required .
This change was prompted by reports of encephalopathy on the ifosfamide arm (described in Results) .
Toxicity was graded according to standard cooperative group criteria .
These women are classified as nonresponders and grouped by randomized treatment in an intent-to-treat analysis .
Toxicities are compared between treatment groups by a Kruskal-Wallis rank test (two-tail) ,  adjusting for ties .
RESULTS .
Between June 1990 and January 1994 ,  454 women entered the study of whom 16 were ineligible (wrong stage ,  n = 2 ,  wrong cell type ,  n = 9 ,  wrong primary tumor ,  n = 2 ,  prior chemotherapy ,  n = 2 ,  second primary tumor ,  n = 1) ,  which left 438 eligible patients (including 10 who received no drug ,  all were included in the intent to-treat analysis) .
CNS toxicity ranged from confusion to somnolence to coma and/or seizures .
In some patients ,  fatigue or weakness was reported and ascribed to chemotherapy .
Chemotherapy concurrently with definitive radiation therapy as a radiosensitizer has been used in some cases of cervix cancer in recent years .
The results of this trial in cervix cancer reflect a common set of findings in combination chemotherapy of advanced solid tumors ,  namely ,  a higher response rate (but not a high CR rate) with a combination compared with single-agent therapy at the cost of more toxicity and no survival benefit .
In the present trial ,  there was a significant improvement in PFS associated with CIFX ,  however ,  its impact on the patient's sense of well-being was not assessed .
Mitolactol is clearly active in advanced cervix cancer as a single agent using a schedule of 180 mg/2/d for 10 days every 4 weeks .
A report that indicated mitolactol therapy of breast cancer was associated with myelodysplasia and secondary leukemias is of concern .
The methotrexate ,  vinblastine ,  doxorubicin , cisplatin (MVAC) regimen ,  popularized in the treatment of transitional cell bladder cancer ,  has recently been reported to be active in cervix cancer .
Such a study would be of great interest .
In fact ,  this appears to be the first evidence of an impact of a chemotherapy regimen on PFS in advanced cervix cancer .
