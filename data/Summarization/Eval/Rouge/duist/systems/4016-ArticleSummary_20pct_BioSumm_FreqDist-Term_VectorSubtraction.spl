Introduction .
An additional 40% of patients experienced tumour stabilisation for a median of 5 months .
Methods .
Endpoints .
Overall survival was the primary endpoint .
Patients' selection .
To be eligible for randomisation ,  patients had to meet the following criteria ,  histologically proven metastatic colorectal cancer ,  progressive metastatic disease documented on the basis of either a 25% increase in the size of target lesions or an increase in carcinoembryonic antigen by 1.25 times an initial reference value and a baseline value of more than 10 ug/L ,   which allowed inclusion of patients with non-measurable  disease (peritoneal carcinomatosis and pelvic recurrences) ,   progression documented by two measurements not separated by  more than 6 months and tumour progression while on  fluorouracil or within 6 months of the last fluorouracil infusion ,  having had one adjuvant and/or no more than two palliative  fluorouracil-based regimens ,  age 18-75 years ,  WHO performance status 0.2 ,  neutrophils 2 10/L or more ,  platelets  100x10/L or more ,  total bilirubin 1.25 the institutional upper normal limit (IUNL) ,  or less ,  liver transaminases 3xIUNL (in  case of liver metastases ,  bilirubin <=1.5 IUNL and  transaminases <=5 IUNL) ,  or more ,  serum creatinine  135 umol/L or less ,  wash-out of 4 weeks for radiotherapy or  chemotherapy ,  and written informed consent .
Randomisation and study treatments .
Follow-up .
Quality of life .
Statistical analysis .
The randomisation was stratified by centre .
Results .
Patients' data .
The patients' characteristics are shown in table 1 .
Overall survival .
In the supportive-care group there were 71 (79%) events ,  the median duration of which was  6.5 (range 0.7-19.3) months .
Median follow-up was 12.9 months .
In the  supportive-care-alone group there were 53 (77%) events ,   median duration 7.4 (0.7-19.3) months .
In the supportive-care group there were 18 (86%) events ,  the median duration of  which was 3.5 (range 1.1-11.0) months .
Secondary endpoints .
More patients with a performance-status of worse than 0 at baseline improved their performance status ,   35% versus 11% (p=0.002) .
In  the supportive-care group there were 26 (79%) events ,   median duration 2.0 (0.13.0) months .
Safety .
Discussion .
This study showed that treatment with irinotecan and supportive care alone ,  compared with supportive care ,  prolonged the life of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer .
The study also showed an advantage for irinotecan for quality of life .
