SINCE JUNE 1973 ,  the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of CMF (cyclophosphamide ,  methotrexate ,  and fluorouracil) chemotherapy were evaluated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes .
The aim of the first program was to evaluate whether CMF given after radical surgery was able to alter the course of the disease .
After radical mastectomy ,  eligible patients were prospectively randomized to receive either no further treatment or 12 monthly cycles of adjuvant CMF .
All our progress reports have consistently demonstrated that there was a significant difference in the relapse-free survival (RFS) favoring patients who received adjuvant CMF .
The 7-yr results of this first program are now available , 6 and they confirm the benefit of CMFtreated patients (RFS 49.2%) as compared to women subjected to radical mastectomy alone (RFS 35.8% ,  p < 0.002) .
These results ,  as well as those reported in similar studies ,  suggest that the multimodality approach with cyclical combination chemotherapy is indeed an important advance in the strategy of primary management of resectable breast cancer ,  and therefore it is worthy of more widespread consideration .
Among the numerous questions to be answered by current adjuvant studies is the optimal duration of treatment .
In fact ,  a relative shortterm adjuvant systemic treatment would spare the patients a considerable amount of toxicity .
For this reason ,  in September 1975 ,  we started a new prospective study with the intent to evaluate the possibility of reducing the duration of adjuvant CMF without compromising the therapeutic effect of combined treatment .
The preliminary 3-yr results have shown that in premenopausal women ,  6 cycles of CMF yielded results that were identical to those obtained with 12 cycles .
Similar findings were reported in the 4-yr analysis for the total patient population .
This article presents the 5-yr results achieved in our study .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Study Design and Treatment Schedule .
Between September 1975 and May 1978 ,  a total of 466 consecutive patients were entered into a prospective randomized study .
Within 4 wk from surgery ,  patients with TI-3a breast cancer ,  histologically positive axillary nodes ,  age < 70 yr ,  and living fairly close to the Institute were allocated to receive either 12 or 6 cycles of CMF .
Before being allocated to either treatment group ,  patients were stratified according to the number of axillary nodes involved (1-3 or more than 3) .
The technique of block randomization (permuted block of length 4 for 2 regimens) was utilized .
Based on the 3-yr analysis of our first CMF study showing an apparent lack of therapeutic advantage following adjuvant chemotherapy in postmenopausal women ,  randomization for this group of patients was discontinued at the end of November 1976 .
Therefore ,  all postmenopausal patients were allocated to receive 12 CMF cycles between December 1976 and March 1977 when accrual for postmenopausal patients was definitely discontinued .
All patients were subjected to either Halsted or modified radical mastectomy ,  but a small fraction (16%) was subjected to extended radical mastectomy .
No postoperative radiotherapy or any other ancillary treatment was given .
Adjuvant chemotherapy was started within 2-4 wk from mastectomy .
The dose schedule of CMF was as follows ,  cyclophosphamide (CTX) 100 mg/sq m by mouth from day 1 to day 14 ,  methotrexate (MTX) 40 mg/sq m intravenously on days 1 and 8 ,  and fluorouracil (FU) 600 mg/sq m intravenously on days 1 and 8 .
No drug was administered from day 15 to day 28 ,  and CMF was recycled on day 29 .
A total of 18 patients older than 65 yr (CMF 12 ,  12 ,  CMF 6 ,  6) were started on low-dose CMF (MTX 30 mg/sq m ,  FU 400 mg/sq m) .
During treatment ,  a dose reduction schedule was applied to all patients showing myelosuppression on days 1 and 8 of each treatment cycle .
The dose of all three drugs was reduced by 50% when the leukocyte count ranged from 3900 to 2500/cu mm or the platelet count from 99,000 to 75,000/cu mm. In the presence of more severe myelosuppression ,  treatment was delayed until at least half of the dose could be administered .
Toxic manifestations other than myelosuppression (e.g. ,  mucositis or cystitis) required temporary dose reduction only if severe .
Primary treatment failure was accurately assessed by clinical ,  radiologic ,  and whenever feasible ,  histologic examination of the site(s) of first relapse .
All radiographs were repeatedly reviewed by a team of radiologists to confirm the presence and exact timing of recurrence .
At first relapse ,  treatment was uniform for both groups of women .
The following systemic treatment was mainly utilized ,  patients in whom estrogen receptors were positive were subjected to hormonal manipulations (ovariectomy in premenopausal women and additive hormonal therapy ,  particularly tamoxifen ,  in postmenopausal patients) ,  combined sometimes with chemotherapy .
When estrogen receptors were negative or could not be determined ,  systemic treatment consisted of combination chemotherapy utilizing preferentially an adriamycin- containing regimen .
Whenever possible ,  patients who refused second-line cytotoxic chemotherapy were treated utilizing hormonal manipulations according to their age .
