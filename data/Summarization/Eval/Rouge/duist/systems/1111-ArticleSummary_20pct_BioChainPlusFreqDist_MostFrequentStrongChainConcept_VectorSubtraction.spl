Stage I cervical cancer has a relatively favorable prognosis with an 80% cure rate achieved with radical hysterectomy or radiotherapy .
Additional risk factors for recurrence ,  e.g. ,  large tumor diameter (LTD) ,  deep stromal invasion (DSI) ,  and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces (CLS) found on microscopic examination have been only recently recognized and less extensively investigated than lymph node metastases .
One of them reported favorable results from an uncontrolled trial of adjuvant radiotherapy .
The GOG #92 multicenter prospective randomized study was designed to determine whether postoperative pelvic radiotherapy following radical hysterectomy and pelvic node dissection would reduce the rate of recurrence and decrease the mortality in Stage IB cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter ,  deep stromal invasion by tumor ,  and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces found on microscopic examination .
All designs allowed for 80% statistical power when performing a one-tail test at the 0.05 level .
Patients were eligible for the study if they had primary Stage IB squamous ,  adenosquamous carcinoma ,  or adenocarcinoma of cervix initially treated with a standard radical hysterectomy and who had negative lymph nodes but one of the previously described combination of risk factors .
Radiation Therapy .
Radiation therapy was started within 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively .
Patients received external beam irradiation and no brachytherapy .
The pelvic irradiation was given with a fourfield technique with a megavoltage beam ,  although cobalt-60 was allowed if the SSD was greater than 80 cm. Radiation dose was from 46 Gy in 23 fractions to 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions ,  5 fractions per week .
The Radiotherapy Committee examined therapy forms ,  diagrams of irradiated fields ,  dosimetry curves ,  and portal fields for each external field .
One hundred and fifty-one patients (55%) were white ,  56 (20%) were black ,  27 (10%) were Hispanic ,  and 21 (8%) were Asian .
There were 128 (46%) patients with the risk factors of positive CLS and deep one-third stromal invasion ,  65 (23%) had positive CLS ,  middle third stromal invasion and tumor size $2 cm ,  82 (30%) had negative CLS ,  middle or deep third stromal invasion and a $4-cm tumor ,  and 2 (0.7%) had positive CLS ,  superficial stromal invasion ,  and tumor size $5 cm (Table 3) .
Of the 137 patients randomized to radiotherapy ,  9 (6.6%) refused all radiotherapy and 6 (4.4%) refused to continue therapy after receiving less than 85% of the prescribed dose of 50.4 Gy (3.6 ,  3.6 ,  10.4 ,  14.4 ,  16.2 ,  and 36.0 Gy) .
One patient discontinued radiotherapy due to an adverse reaction after receiving 21.6 Gy .
The log–rank test was statistically significant (P 5 0.008 ,  one-tail) .
The Cox model analysis indicated that when adjusting for all combinations of the three risk factors—tumor size ,  CLS ,  and the depth of invasion—the risk of recurrence was significantly reduced by 44% in the radiation group (P 5 0.019 ,  one-tail) .
Of those who are alive ,  six patients are lost-to-follow-up within the first year in the RT group while one is lost in the NFT group .
Nine (7.0%) of the 128 patients who received radiotherapy had 11 episodes of grade 3 (severe) or 4 (life-threatening) adverse effects compared to 3 (2.1%) from the NFT group .
One patient with severely decreased bladder volume required a permanent Indiana pouch urinary conduit for relief of urinary incontinence .
Both large tumor diameter and deep stromal invasion are indices of large tumor volume ,  conceivably affecting cancer progression and its metastatic spread .
A detailed GOG clinical pathologic study had established that certain patients with poor prognostic factors related to the primary tumor (i.e. ,  large tumor size ,  deep stromal invasion ,  and capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement) but without lymph node involvement had a risk of recurrence of 31% after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy .
The present prospective randomized study showed that adjunctive radiotherapy significantly reduced the number of cancer recurrences in women with the above risk factors by 44% and that the difference in recurrences between irradiated and nonirradiated patients was statistically significant at the P 5 0.019 level .
However ,  caution must be observed due to the disproportionately higher number of patients that are “lost to followup” among those receiving radiation therapy and the need for further follow-up to determine what impact radiation therapy has on survival .
One report showed that postoperative radiation “prevented local recurrences and improved ten year tumor-free-survival” in a small number of women with CLS ,  DSI ,  and microscopically involved lymph nodes .
The GOG attempted to conduct a randomized radiotherapy trial for women with positive nodes ,  but could not complete the study because of failure to enroll a sufficient number of patients (unpublished GOG data) .
Increased morbidity in patients receiving full course radiotherapy following radical surgery for cervical cancer has been reported .
In our study ,  major lifethreatening adverse effects were encountered in 5 (4%) womenamong the 128 who received radiotherapy .
One of these women died from complications of enteric fistula and another died from cancer after successful management of intestinal injury .
Thus ,  adjunctive radiotherapy is beneficial for Stage I cervical cancer patients with clinical–pathological risk factors for recurrence other than positive nodes .
