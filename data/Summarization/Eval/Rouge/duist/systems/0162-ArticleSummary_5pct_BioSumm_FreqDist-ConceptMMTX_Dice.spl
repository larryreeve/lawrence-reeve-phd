The dose schedule of CMF was as follows ,  cyclophosphamide (CTX) 100 mg/sq m by mouth from day 1 to day 14 ,  methotrexate (MTX) 40 mg/sq m intravenously on days 1 and 8 ,  and fluorouracil (FU) 600 mg/sq m intravenously on days 1 and 8 .
The following systemic treatment was mainly utilized ,  patients in whom estrogen receptors were positive were subjected to hormonal manipulations (ovariectomy in premenopausal women and additive hormonal therapy ,  particularly tamoxifen ,  in postmenopausal patients) ,  combined sometimes with chemotherapy .
Prior to mastectomy ,  all patients underwent complete physical examination ,  x-ray of chest and skeleton (skull ,  spine ,  pelvis ,  upper third of femurs) ,  liver scan ,  bilateral mammography ,  hemogram ,  and biochemical tests .
Biochemical tests (serum bilirubin ,  total proteins ,  alkaline phosphatase ,  SGOT and SGPT ,  and LDH) were repeated every 6 mo during the first 3 yr and once a year thereafter .
It appears evident that ,  (A) the two series given 12 cycles of CMF achieved the same results ,  (B) the data reported in the three series treated with CMF are almost equivalent ,  (C) adjuvant CMF ,  whether administered for 12 or 6 cycles ,  was able to alter the course of operable breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes compared to the group subjected to radical mastectomy alone .
More recently ,  the Guy's Hospital and Manchester study groups reported the actuarial 5-yr RFS of a randomized study comparing radical mastectomy alone versus melphalan versus CMF and showed that the only group significantly improved by adjuvant CMF was that of postmenopausal women ,  while premenopausal patients had findings that were superimposable in all three treatment groups .
Also ,  the Arizona group utilizing a different combination regimen ,  i.e. ,  adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide ,  for about 6 mo achieved a 5-yr RFS that is very similar to that observed in ourstudies .
Moreover ,  a less protracted exposure to cytotoxic regimens ,  including alkylating agents and adriamycin ,  could decrease the potential risk of delayed morbidity ,  namely cancerogenesis and chronic organ damage .
Furthermore ,  to insure full drug doses in the new protocols ,  we have modified the CMF regimen and all three drugs are administered intravenously every 3 wk (CTX and FU 600 mg/sq m ,  MTX 40 mg/sq m) .
