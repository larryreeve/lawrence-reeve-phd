Epirubicin (4'-epi-doxorubicin ,  EPI) is one such compound .
The antitumor activity of EPI in animal models is similar to that of DOX ,  but EPI is a less toxic compound with regard to both cytotoxicity and cardiac injury .
In the mouse ,  EPI and DOX have similar patterns of distribution to various tissues ,  although drug levels are lower in heart and spleen with EPI .
Pharmacokinetic studies in tumor-bearing mice and rats indicate that EPI is more extensively metabolized by liver than DOX .
The two compounds have similar pharmacokinetic behavior in humans ,  although EPI is eliminated more rapidly .
In two clinical phase I studies ,  EPI was found to have acceptable toxicity at doses of 85 to 90 mg/m2 given intravenously (IV) every three weeks .
Other criteria for eligibility included a performance status of - 50% (Karnofsky scale) ,  a WBC count - 4,000/14L ,  a platelet count >- 100,000/L ,  normal serum bilirubin levels ( < 1.5 mg/dL) ,  and objectively evaluable or measurable disease .
Treatment ProtocolEPI was supplied by Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Milan ,  Italy) in a powdered form that was reconstituted with sterile water for injection United States Pharmacopeia .
Both EPI and DOX were administered by slow (five minute) injections through an established IV line every three weeks .
The dose of EPI was 85 mg/m2 ,  and the dose of DOX was 60 mg/m2 .
Cardiac toxicity was assessed in all patients by both clinical evaluation and RNCA .
Antineoplastic therapy was discontinued if the LVEF decreased to < 40% or if the patient developed clinical congestive heart failure .
The median WBC nadir was 2.0 x 103/gL (range ,  0.1 to 8.6) and the median platelet nadir was 132 x 103//pL (range ,  20.0 to 279.0) in patients receiving EPI ,  the median WBC nadir was 1.8 x 10'/3tL (range ,  0.3 to .9) and median platelet nadir was 130 x 103/pL (range 24.0 to 253.0) in patients on the DOX arm .
Nausea or vomiting was documented in 58% of patients who received EPI and 67% of the patients who were treated with DOX .
The median cumulative dose to laboratory cardiotoxicity in these patients was 892 mg/m2 of EPI and 360 mg/m 2 of DOX .
The median dose to development of cardiotoxicity for all evaluable patients was 935 mg/m2 for EPI and 468 mg/m2 for DOX (Fig 2A) .
Overall ,  100% of the planned dose of EPI (85 mg/m2) was administered ,  however ,  only 86% (52 mg/m2) of the planned dose of DOX was given .
Thus ,  all EPI doses were multiplied by 52/85 to compare the two drugs in equivalent units ,  and Kaplan-Meier estimates plotted (Fig 2B) .
Thus ,  even accounting for the difference in myelosuppressive potency ,  EPI is less cardiotoxic than DOX .
The cumulative doses of EPI at which clinical CHF was observed (1,035 ,  1,105 ,  1,162 ,  and 1,234 mg/m 2) were approximately twice the cumulative doses of DOX at which CHF was seen (456 ,  480 ,  492 ,  560 ,  and 600 mg/m2) .
There was a statistically significant greater cumulative dose to CHF for patients receiving EPI (log rank test ,  P - .008) with and without adjustment for the difference in myelosuppressive potency .
Since only five patients treated with DOX and four treated with EPI actually developed clinical heart failure ,  this result should not be overinterpreted .
Among patients who experienced clinical CHF ,  however ,  the median cumulative doses to CHF were 1,134 mg/m2 of EPI and 492 mg/m 2 of DOX .
DISCUSSIONIn this study ,  EPI had therapeutic activity in breast cancer similar to DOX ,  but produced less cardiotoxicity than the parent compound .
Although empiric dose restriction is widely practiced ,  many patients experience the onset of CHF before they receive 550 mg/m2 of the drug .
In a prospective adjuvant chemotherapy trial for patients with soft-tissue sarcomas ,  14% of patients who received 430 to 600 mg/m2 of DOX developed clinical CHF .
This suggests that EPI might have a better therapeutic index in patients with cancer .
In the present trial ,  EPI was compared with its parent compound in terms of both toxicity and antitumor efficacy .
On a molar basis ,  EPI was clearly less myelosuppressive than DOX ,  EPI was also less cardiotoxic .
The difference in cardiac toxicity was manifested by the difference in total cumulative dose at which changes in LVEF occurred (Fig 2A) ,  as well as by the difference in dose at which clinical CHF was seen (EPI ,  1,035 to 1,234 mg/m 2 v DOX ,  456 to 600 mg/m2) .
Expressed more plainly ,  is EPI a less cardiotoxic anthracycline ,  or merely a less potent anthracycline? .
Brambilla and coworkers in Milan33 studied equal doses (75 mg/m2) of both drugs every three weeks ,  they limited the total cumulative dose of each drug to 600 mg/m2 .
In the present study ,  EPI was found to be significantly less cardiotoxic than DOX ,  even when the dose is normalized to full myelosuppressive equivalence .
In the multidrug study ,  no clinical cardiac dysfunction was seen in the EPI-containing (FEC) arm .
Although the numbers are small ,  in the Milan study three of five patients treated with DOX in whom RNCA was performed showed a decrease in LVEF of more than 10% (375 ,  450 ,  and 525 mg/m2) .
Assuming equal therapeutic potency ,  this analysis indicated that every three week EPI is less cardiotoxic than every three week DOX (P = .0005) and borderline less toxic than weekly DOX (P = .06) .
Although at times a decrease in LVEF was observed immediately before the development of CHF ,  we were unable to confirm the previously described pattern of predictable progressive decline in LVEF over time for all patients.6 Many patients maintained their left ventricular function at the baseline value until it worsened abruptly shortly before or at the time that clinical CHF was observed .
Our results show that EPI has therapeutic activity that is similar to that of DOX in patients with advanced breast cancer ,  and that EPI is a less cardiotoxic drug than DOX ,  even accounting for the difference in myelosuppressive potency .
In addition ,  the preliminary results from the FEC v FAC combination chemotherapy trial suggest that EPI should be studied further in combination with other active agents in patients with advanced breast cancer .
ADDENDUMSince this manuscript was prepared for publication ,  an additional patient treated with DOX developed clinical congestive heart failure in the postoperative period following exploratory laparotomy .
