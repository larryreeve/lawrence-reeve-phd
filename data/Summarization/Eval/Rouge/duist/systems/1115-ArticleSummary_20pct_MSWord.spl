As the bulk of pelvic diseaseTo date ,  the only reported randomized studies of concurrent therapy are those of hydroxyurea and radiation versus radiation alone .
In vitro data suggested that the addition of infusional 5-FU to radiation therapy would enhance the radiation effect .
Stratum 2 included those with FIGO stage IIB disease with any lateral parametrial involvement or stage IIIB with involvement of one pelvic sidewall .
Stratum 3 included those with FIGO stage IIIB and bilateral pelvic wall involvement or stage IVA .
The partially hyperfractionated radiation fractionation schedule used equal fraction sizes of 160 cGy .
Statistical Methods and Study DesignThe outcomes of interest in this study were pelvic control ,  survival ,  and disease-free survival ,  as well as the serious late complication rate .
Two factors were altered in arm (d) compared to standard arm (a): (1) the addition of 5-FU ,  (2) the change in radiation fractionation scheme .
ComplicationsOf the 234 patients randomized ,  221 were evaluable .
The number excluded in each stratum were 6 in stratum 1 ,  3 in stratum 2 ,  and 4 in stratum 3. stratum 3. The median tumor size in stratum 2 was 7 cm.Intracavitary radiation was used in all but 19 of the 221 patients .
In the ‘‘partially hyperfractionated irradiation arm’’ (c) ,  two patients had radiation dose violations ,  one a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions and the other a dose of 59 Gy in 33 fractions .
In the standard radiation plus 5-FU arm (b) ,  52 of the 53 patients received the standard dose prescription .
Of the 23 patients who received no intracavitary radiation or doses less than 500 cGy ,  there was a relatively even distribution across the treatment arms with 5 in arm (a) ,  5 in arm (b) ,  3 in arm (c) ,  and 9 in arm (d) .
Seven of these 23 patients received a compensatory boost of external radiation in doses of 6 to 16 Gy .
Pelvic Control and SurvivalOne patient died of complications and 13 died of causes other than disease or complications .
Table 3 shows the Kaplan–Meier estimates of 5-year disease-free survival and pelvic control for each stratum .
The Kaplan–Meier plots of overall disease-free survival ,  disease-free survival for each stratum ,  and disease free survival by treatment assigned are shown in Figs. 2 ,  3 ,  and4 ,  respectively .
There is no significant difference in the overall 5-year disease-free survival between the treatment arms .
Thereis a trend in favor of standard radiation and 5-FU .
There was a significant improvement in 5-year survival and disease-free survival for those treated with standard radiation and 5-FU compared to the other treatments (log rank test P 5 0.05) .
The actuarial 5-year disease-free survival was 76% compared to 65% for hyperfractionated irradiation plus 5-FU ,  58% for hyperfractionated irradiation alone ,  and 39% for standard radiation .
Similar differences were observed in pelvic control ,  but the addition of 5-FU to standard radiation resulted in a greater improvement in disease-free survival than in pelvic control .
In examining the effect of the addition of 5-FU on disease-free survival in stratum 1 ,  there is a highly significant difference in favor of the use of 5-FU regardless of the radiation employed .
It was hoped that the use of two treatments daily during the 5-FU infusion would increase any opportunity for 5-FU-radiation interaction by increasing the total amount of radiation given concurrently with 5-FU .
The observed differences in pelvic control and survival in favor of the standard radiation and concurrent 5-FU associated with the addition of 5-FU rather than the change in radiation schedule .
Stratum 2 was examined for differences in pelvic control and survival between the treatment arms and no significant differences were observed .
Since significant differences in pelvic control and survival were observed in stratum 1 which contained only 99 patients ,  it is important to examine whether there was an uneven distribution of other possible patient or tumor-related prognostic factors across the treatment arms to account for the differences observed .
For those receiving standard RT ,  the pelvic control rate was 60% but the disease-free survival was only 39% .
If anything ,  there was a slight excess of larger tumors in those receiving standard radiation and 5-FU ,  the arm with the best outcomes .
The radiation scheme used in this study conforms to those guidelines ,  although the inability to apply intracavitary radiation in 10% of these patients with advanced disease wasPatients were stratified into three groups in this study because pelvic control and survival outcomes are strongly influenced by the bulk of pelvic disease ,  declining with increasing bulk .
The original design for this study required 292 patients with adequate power to detect a 15% difference in pelvic control and survival .
The disease-free survival with standard radiation alone ,  however ,  was surprisingly low at 39% .
A factorial analysis compared the outcome for all patients treated with concurrent 5-FU compared to those without 5-FU .
The direction of benefit in favor of 5-FU with standard radiation compared to the other treatments was the same in strata 1 and 2. The treatment related factors examined were the use of intracavitary radiation ,  the use of 5-FU ,  and the fractionation scheme ,  standard versus partially hyperfractionated .
The only significant factor predicting for disease-free survival was the use of 5-FU .
The observed complication rate in any of the treatment arms appears acceptable ,  7% with standard radiation whether or not 5-FU was added and 4% in the hyperfractionated radiation arms whether or not 5-FU was added .
Hyperfractionated radiation and 5-FU should theoretically have offered a benefit over that of standard radiation and 5-FU if increased tumor cell kill results from any interaction between the modalities .
The observation that 5-FU impacted more on survival than pelvic control in stratum 1 is difficult to explain .
The number of patients is too few to recommend that concurrent infusional 5-FU with pelvic irradiation should become the standard therapy for these patients .
