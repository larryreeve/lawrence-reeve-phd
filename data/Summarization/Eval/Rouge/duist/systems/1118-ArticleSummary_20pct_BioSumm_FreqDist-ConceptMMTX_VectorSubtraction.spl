INTRODUCTION .
This is associated with a high incidence of distant metastasis ,  in which 30% of patients subsequently developed metastases either alone or in combination with pelvic failure .
Trial Design .
From October 1990 to April 1995 ,  patients with advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix were entered on the study and randomly assigned to either radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy .
The trial compared the efficacy and tolerability of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer .
Patients .
A total of 122 patients with advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix were included in this study .
The disease was staged according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) in 1991 .
Treatment Plan .
A dose of 4400 cGy was delivered in 22 equal fractions over 30 to 35 days .
This was followed by six courses of intracavitary brachytherapy 1 to 2 weeks after external beam radiotherapy was completed .
In the study design ,  it was assumed that 60 eligible patients would be randomly assigned to each treatment group .
Differences in survival rates were assessed by the log-rank test .
Comparisons of variables between groups were based on the x2 test .
RESULTS .
A total of 122 patients with advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix were entered and all were eligible for follow-up evaluation .
Among them ,  60 patients were randomized to the concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy ,  62 were randomized to the radiotherapy alone .
Patient characteristics were well balanced between the compared groups .
Among them ,  interrupted radiotherapy with delayed treatment because of treatment-related toxicity was observed in 9 cases .
Of the radiotherapy group ,  60 patients completed radiotherapy with no delays of treatment for toxicity ,  whereas the planned radiotherapy was interrupted for 1 week in 2 patients because of radiation protitis or neutropenia .
However ,  there was no difference in completeness between concurrent group and radiotherapy group (96.7% versus 100% ,  P = 0.24) .
Additionally ,  there was also no difference in the incidence of distant failure between the chemoradiotherapy group and the radiotherapy group (21.6% versus 29% ,  P Å 0.47) .
Of the radiation group ,  33 patients (53.2%) are alive without evidence of disease ,  7 (11.3%) remain alive with disease ,  and 22 (35.5%) died of disease at 12 ­ 45 months .
DISCUSSION .
Therefore ,  the design of a more efficient treatment modality ,  such as the addition of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy ,  with the objective of increasing tumor control and long-term survival for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma ,  is advocated .
To date ,  cisplatin is one of the most active drugs tested in this tumor .
This drug has also been shown to be a radiosensitizer in vitro and in vivo with documented activity in squamous cell carcinoma .
However ,  most of these results were nonrandomized and were based on a small sample size .
Our study also revealed that the patterns of recurrences were not changed by the concomitant therapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
This finding has been associated with occult extrapelvic disease .
Such trials are currently underway .
