SINCE JUNE 1973 ,  the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of CMF (cyclophosphamide ,  methotrexate ,  and fluorouracil) chemotherapy were evaluated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes .
The 7-yr results of this first program are now available , 6 and they confirm the benefit of CMFtreated patients (RFS 49.2%) as compared to women subjected to radical mastectomy alone (RFS 35.8% ,  p < 0.002) .
These results ,  as well as those reported in similar studies ,  suggest that the multimodality approach with cyclical combination chemotherapy is indeed an important advance in the strategy of primary management of resectable breast cancer ,  and therefore it is worthy of more widespread consideration .
Within 4 wk from surgery ,  patients with TI-3a breast cancer ,  histologically positive axillary nodes ,  age < 70 yr ,  and living fairly close to the Institute were allocated to receive either 12 or 6 cycles of CMF .
The dose schedule of CMF was as follows ,  cyclophosphamide (CTX) 100 mg/sq m by mouth from day 1 to day 14 ,  methotrexate (MTX) 40 mg/sq m intravenously on days 1 and 8 ,  and fluorouracil (FU) 600 mg/sq m intravenously on days 1 and 8 .
The dose of all three drugs was reduced by 50% when the leukocyte count ranged from 3900 to 2500/cu mm or the platelet count from 99,000 to 75,000/cu mm. In the presence of more severe myelosuppression ,  treatment was delayed until at least half of the dose could be administered .
The following systemic treatment was mainly utilized ,  patients in whom estrogen receptors were positive were subjected to hormonal manipulations (ovariectomy in premenopausal women and additive hormonal therapy ,  particularly tamoxifen ,  in postmenopausal patients) ,  combined sometimes with chemotherapy .
In fact ,  the retrospective evaluation of roentgenograms revealed the presence of distant metastases prior to radical mastectomy in 3 patients (CMF 12 ,  1 ,  CMF 6 ,  2) ,  while 4 additional women (CMF 12 ,  3 ,  CMF 6 ,  1) had fixation of the primary tumor to the underlying pectoral fascia or muscle (T3b) .
Prior to mastectomy ,  all patients underwent complete physical examination ,  x-ray of chest and skeleton (skull ,  spine ,  pelvis ,  upper third of femurs) ,  liver scan ,  bilateral mammography ,  hemogram ,  and biochemical tests .
Biochemical tests (serum bilirubin ,  total proteins ,  alkaline phosphatase ,  SGOT and SGPT ,  and LDH) were repeated every 6 mo during the first 3 yr and once a year thereafter .
In postmenopausal women with more than 3 nodes ,  the difference between CMF 12 (34.4%) and CMF 6 (54.9% ,  p = 0.18) is only apparent since the confidence-limits throughout the curve totally blurred the percent difference (standard error ,  or SE ,  at 5 yr ,  8.4 and 11.3 ,  respectively) .
The somewhat contrasting results observed in the 6-cycle group in pre- and postmenopausal patients with 1-3 nodes (80.3% versus 66.1%) again reflect only a fictitious difference (SE ,  4.1 and 8.1 ,  respectively) .
However ,  in spite of the fact that frequency of objective remission was superimposable (-30%) in both ER groups regardless of treatment administered and site(s) of first involvement ,  the disease in ER + tumors had amore indolent course ,  while ER - tumors showed further progression within a few months .
Table 4 shows that also in this series there was evidence of a dose-response effect ,  regardless of menopausal and nodal status (CMF 12 ,  level I 68.9% versus level 11147.2% ,  p < 0.05 ,  CMF 6 ,  level I 66.6% versus level III 51.5% ,  p = 0.10) .
Myelosuppression represented the dose-limiting factor in the large majority of patients (70%-80%) ,  but severe leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia were rare (10%) ,  and prolonged myelosuppression beyond the fourth week from drug discontinuation was never observed .
Only a small subgroup of 22 patients (4.8%) refused to complete the planned program ,  and this was essentially due to negative psychologic reasons since these patients objected to being on a heavy and toxic treatment program (drug injections and timing of follow-up) without having visible disease .
In one patient of the 6-cycle group ,  endometrial carcinoma in situ was documented within 16 mo from mastectomy ,  3 patients in the 12-cycle group developed endometrial carcinoma ,  thyroid cancer ,  and myoblastoma ,  respectively ,  and in all patients second neoplasms were diagnosed between 46 and 49 mo from mastectomy .
The observation that in some patient subsets 6 cycles of CMF yielded apparently superior results to 12 cycles is probably related to the relative number of patients in each group and to the different median follow-up in postmenopausal women  whose accrual was discontinued in December 1976 .
In this trial ,  patients with > 4 positive axillary nodes or with a positive node in the highest axillary zone were randomized to receive cyclophosphamide and adriamycin for 5 courses (15 wk) or the same regimen given for 10 courses (30 wk) .
It appears evident that ,  (A) the two series given 12 cycles of CMF achieved the same results ,  (B) the data reported in the three series treated with CMF are almost equivalent ,  (C) adjuvant CMF ,  whether administered for 12 or 6 cycles ,  was able to alter the course of operable breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes compared to the group subjected to radical mastectomy alone .
The first and most important one is that there appears to be no real difference following adjuvant chemotherapy ,  namely CMF ,  between the RFS of pre- versus postmenopausal women (CMF 12 ,  59.3% versus 57.6% ,  CMF 6 ,  66.5% versus 63.1% ,  respectively) .
More recently ,  the Guy's Hospital and Manchester study groups reported the actuarial 5-yr RFS of a randomized study comparing radical mastectomy alone versus melphalan versus CMF and showed that the only group significantly improved by adjuvant CMF was that of postmenopausal women ,  while premenopausal patients had findings that were superimposable in all three treatment groups .
In spite of initial controversial findings ,  recent retrospective studies carried out in advanced breast cancer have consistently shown lack of significant correlation between ER status and response rate to cytotoxic chemotherapy .
Patterns of first treatment failure were not different in the two series and ,  regardless of treatment instituted upon relapse ,  frequency of objective remissions were similar between the two groups followed by short-lived remissions in ER - tumors ,  while ER + tumors tended to show slow growing disease .
Based on our current findings ,  i.e. ,  therapeutic efficacy of adjuvant CMF regardless of ER status ,  there seems to be no clinical reason to withhold the administration of adjuvant combination chemotherapy in node positive women even in the presence of ER + tumors .
Through the analysis of our results in advanced breast cancer treated with CMF ,  Skipper came to the conclusion that in clinically metastatic disease the nadir in surviving tumor cells is probably reached in the majority of patients in less than 6 cycles .
In fact ,  although both frequency and intensity of acute toxicity from adjuvant therapy such as CMF are moderate ,  patients can be spared unnecessary side effects ,  including negative psychologic reactions ,  if treatment duration is rendered more tolerable .
Moreover ,  a less protracted exposure to cytotoxic regimens ,  including alkylating agents and adriamycin ,  could decrease the potential risk of delayed morbidity ,  namely cancerogenesis and chronic organ damage .
The reason(s) why RFS was not improved by prolonging chemotherapy once pathologic complete remission has been achieved ,  in our own trial and in other adjuvant trials for breast cancer ,  as well as in a variety of neoplastic diseases ,  can now be interpreted by considering the problem of specifically multidrug-resistant phenotypes .
The 40-yr-old mutation theory of Luria and Delbruck developed for bacterial cells was recently adapted to cancer ,  i.e. ,  neoplastic cells mutate spontaneously to a state of specific resistance to a wide variety of anticancer drugs .
In our optimal kinetic situation ,  cyclic or sequential delivery of equally effective and non-cross-resistant drugs often will prevent or delay failures due to overgrowth of drug-resistant sublines of neoplastic cells ,  as recently demonstrated in advanced Hodgkin's disease .
Furthermore ,  to insure full drug doses in the new protocols ,  we have modified the CMF regimen and all three drugs are administered intravenously every 3 wk (CTX and FU 600 mg/sq m ,  MTX 40 mg/sq m) .
In the presence of myelosuppression(leukocytes < 3800/cu mm and/or platelets < 100,000/cu mm) on day 22 ,  treatment is delayed 1-2 wk to allow a constant delivery of full doses .
Only long-term analysis will answer the questions of whether the addition of adjuvant hormone therapy to chemotherapy will improve the results in ER + tumors and whether the excellent results reported by the M D Anderson Hospital with FAC (fluorouracil ,  adriamycin ,  cyclophosphamide) in women with > 4 axillary nodes 7 will be reproducible .
At present ,  tumor cell burden in the axilla appears to consistently represent an important prognostic factor ,  even in the presence of full dose chemotherapy ,  while new prospective trials should explore the potential efficacy of multiple non-cross-resistant drug combinations delivered for a relatively short time .
