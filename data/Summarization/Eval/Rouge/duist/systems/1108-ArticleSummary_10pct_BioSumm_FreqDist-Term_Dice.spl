THE American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics define stage IB cervical cancer as invasive cancer that is confined to the cervix ,  with a depth of more than 5 mm and a width of more than 7 mm. In patients with large stage IB cervical cancers ,  local control and survival are poorer than in patients with smaller stage I cancers ,  whether treated by surgery or irradiation .
In a previous randomized trial of combined external and intracavitary irradiation alone or followed by extrafascial hysterectomy ,  the Gynecologic Oncology Group found that hysterectomy did not improve survival ,  but it did significantly reduce the rate of relapse in the pelvic region (unpublished data) .
We elected to test this combination in a phase 3 trial to determine whether concurrent weekly treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy would improve progression-free survival and survival in women with large “bulky , ” or barrel-shaped ,  stage IB cervical cancers .
Women of any age with biopsy-proved primary squamous-cell carcinoma ,  adenocarcinoma ,  or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix of stage IB (exophytic or expansile barrel-shaped tumors with a minimal diameter of 4 cm) were eligible for the study .
All patients were required to have a Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status of 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  or 3 (equivalent to Karnofsky performance scores of 90 or 100 ,  70 or 80 ,  50 or 60 ,  and 30 or 40 ,  respectively) and adequate bone marrow ,  renal function ,  and hepatic function .
Pelvic radiation was delivered with the four-field technique with x-ray accelerators of at least 4-MV photons at a distance of at least 100 cm. The treatment field was set to extend 3 cm beyond the known extent of disease and to encompass iliac and lower common iliac lymph nodes .
The design called for a final analysis when 56 events (recurrences or deaths) had occurred in patients receiving the control regimen (radiotherapy alone) and provided the study with a statistical power of 80 percent with use of the log-rank test and a one-sided significance level of 0.05 .
Four were subsequently excluded after a central review by the pathology committee found that the specimen was inadequate for evaluation in the case of one patient , the primary lesion had been misidentified in the case of one patient ,  the cell type had been misidentified in the case of one patient ,  and the stage of the tumor had been overestimated in the case of one patient .
The treatment of women with bulky stage IB cervical cancers has historically been only partially satisfactory ,  with survival rates of 70 to 75 percent ,  substantially below the rates of 88 to 92 percent expected with smaller stage IB cancers .
The effect of these two drugs in combination with radiotherapy was compared with the effect of hydroxyurea and radiotherapy in a randomized phase 3 trial by the Gynecologic Oncology Group involving patients with cervical cancer of stages IIB through IVA (unpublished data) .
The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group study ,  whose results appear elsewhere in this issue of the Journal ,  compared pelvic and para-aortic radiotherapy with pelvic radiotherapy in  combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil in patients with clinical stage IB through IVA cervical cancer .
The Southwest Oncology Group study compared pelvic radiotherapy alone with pelvic radiotherapy in combination with fluorouracil and cisplatin in high-risk patients  with involvement of lymph nodes or surgical margins who had undergone radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer stage IA2 ,  IB ,  or IIA (unpublished data) .
In the earlier Gynecologic Oncology Group study that assessed the value of extrafascial hysterectomy after radiotherapy ,  surgery was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of relapses in the pelvic region ,  but the overall risk of recurrence was not significantly reduced (relative risk ,  0.76 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.52 to 1.12) and there was no significant difference in survival (relative risk of death ,  0.91) .
The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment ,  but they share a common result ,  all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin .
