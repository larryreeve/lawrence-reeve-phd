While this treatment is relatively effective in small volume tumors ,  tumor control and survival decline as the bulk of pelvic disease and FIGO stage advance .
Many investigations are ongoing to identify more effective treatment .
These include modifications of radiation treatment volume or fractionation including extended field radiation ,  hyperfractionated RT ,  strategies to overcome the negative impact of tumor hypoxia such as hyperbaric oxygen ,  or hypoxic cell radiation sensitizers .
Concurrent chemotherapy with radiation offers a number of theoretical advantages over those of the neoadjuvant strategy .
Chemotherapy may also ,  as in the neoadjuvant strategy ,  have an independent ,  additive cytotoxic effect .
Theoretical disadvantages of concurrent administration include increased acute toxicity which might limit or delay the delivery of definitive irradiation or increased late toxicity particularly if the drugs and radiation do not exhibit ‘‘toxicity’’ independence .
Last ,  it is unlikely that concurrent chemotherapy usually given as only one or two doses would significantly reduce established distant micrometastases .
While these studies suggested some benefit for patients with FIGO stage IIIB cancer ,  methodological problems in the study have not resulted in wide acceptance of the conclusion of benefit from concurrent hydroxyurea and its concurrent use has not entered standard practice .
The optimal dosing schedule for maximizing cell kill with infusional 5-FU and radiation remains undefined ,  but laboratory data suggested greater effects with increasing dose and prolonged exposure to 5-FU and when drug was present for intervals in excess of 48 h after radiation .
Eligible patients were to have biopsy proven invasive carcinoma of the cervix of any pathological type excluding small cell carcinoma and to have primary radiotherapy with curative intent selected as their definitive treatment .
Patients were randomized to receive either (a) standard external beam pelvic irradiation (EBRT) in a dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions defined at 100% versus ,  (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional intravenous 5-FU in a dose of 1 g/m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  (c) partially hyperfractionated RT ,  5280 cGy in 33 fractions ,  2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  or (d) arm (c) with the same infusional 5-FU .
After EBRT all patients were planned to receive low dose rate intracavitary irradiation to deliver a dose of 40 Gy at point A .
The partially hyperfractionated radiation fractionation schedule used equal fraction sizes of 160 cGy .
For rare patients with disease extension to the lower one-third of vagina ,  the first application to the cervix and uterus was modified to deliver 30 Gy at 2 cm from the center of the sources and a second application as a line source in the vagina ,  was used to deliver a further 20 Gy at 0.5 cm depth from the surface of the vagina. 5-FU was given as an infusion from days 1 to 4 inclusive and on treatment days 22 to 25 inclusive .
Where possible ,  chemotherapy infusion was given on four consecutive days without a weekend break .
Appropriate guidelines for 5-FU dosage reduction or elimination were recommended for hematologic or mucosal toxicity ,  but RT interruptions were not .
Statistical Methods and Study Design .
Assuming that the magnitude and direction of the 5-FU effects were similar in arms (b) and (d) then the effect of the addition of 5-FU could be tested by comparing arms (b) and (d) with arms (a) and (c) .
The reduced fraction size in arms (c) and (d) was designed to attempt to take advantage of knowledge of the affect of fraction size on late complications and to determine whether complication rates were decreased by using decreased fraction size .
Additionally ,  the changed fractionation scheme with delivery of two fractions daily at the beginning and end of therapy was designed to maximize the potential for interaction between 5-FU and radiation and to potentially reduce complication rates .
In order to detect a 20% improvement in pelvic control rate from an expected 50% for arm (a) to 70% for arm (d) assuming an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.20 ,  73 patients in each of four treatment arms would be required for a total of 292 patients .
In order to detect an improvement of 15% in survival in arms (c) and (d) compared to that seen in arms (a) and (b) ,  assuming a 40% cause-specific survival rate in arm (a) and an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.2 ,  the total number of patients required was 272 .
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate median follow-up duration ,  censoring patients who died .
Severe late or chronic bowel symptoms were those of fistula ,  perforation ,  stricture ,  or obstruction requiring hospitalization or surgery and bleeding requiring transfusion .
Severe bladder symptoms were any condition requiring surgery ,  e.g. ,  fistula ,  or hematuria requiring transfusion .
Cytopenias were classed as grade 3 if bleeding or infection/fever occurred due to low blood counts and grade 2 if neutrophils were less than 1000 units/L or platelets less than 50,000 units/L .
The median size of tumor was 6.5 cm (range 3.5 to 18 cm) .
One hundred and ninety of 221 patients received external beam radiation using the box technique ,  while 31 were treated with a parallel pair .
In the ‘‘partially hyperfractionated irradiation arm’’ (c) ,  two patients had radiation dose violations ,  one a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions and the other a dose of 59 Gy in 33 fractions .
In the standard radiation plus 5-FU arm (b) ,  52 of the 53 patients received the standard dose prescription .
Of the patients randomized to receive standard radiation with 5-FU ,  four received no chemotherapy and three received less than 1 g/m2 with each course .
In patients randomized to receive hyperfractionated irradiation and 5-FU ,  three received no chemotherapy and three received less than 1 g/m2 with each course .
When the radiation fraction size is reduced as in this altered fractionation scheme a compensatory increase in total dose over the same overall time is required to reach a biologically similar dose .
Given the low incidence of late complications it is not possible to establish an actuarial probability of risk with these regimens .
To reach the conclusion that concurrent chemotherapy truly adds benefit to results achievable with radiation alone ,  it is important that the radiation be delivered in an optimal manner with adequate doses at ‘‘Point A’’ (80 to 90 Gy) and limited overall treatment times .
The rationale for the use of concurrent infusional 5-FU and the treatment regimens studied has been discussed in detail in a previous publication .
The tumor- and patient-related factors examined were FIGO stage (IB versus IIA versus IIB) ,  size of tumor (greater or less than 6 cm and greater or less than 7 cm) ,  grade of tumor the presence or absence of capillary-like space involvement ,  nodal involvement ,  and patient age as a continuous variable .
The treatment related factors examined were the use of intracavitary radiation ,  the use of 5-FU ,  and the fractionation scheme ,  standard versus partially hyperfractionated .
The changed fractionation scheme ,  using smaller than conventional fraction sizes and a 6% increase in total dose was designed to be approximately biologically equivalent for tumor control to that of standard radiation yet lead to reduced complications .
Hyperfractionated radiation and 5-FU should theoretically have offered a benefit over that of standard radiation and 5-FU if increased tumor cell kill results from any interaction between the modalities .
Theoretical explanations for the lack of benefit may include a reduction in tumor cell kill due to the reduced radiation fraction size and/or an insufficient compensatory increase in total dose to compensate for the reduced fraction size .
The lack of significant benefit for 5-FU in stratum 2 may be due to the small sample size or ,  theoretically ,  that the added chemotherapy was insufficient to significantly impact on more advanced disease .
