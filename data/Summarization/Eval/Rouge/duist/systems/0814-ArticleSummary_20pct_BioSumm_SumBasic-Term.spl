Loco-regional and distant relapses contribute to impair theoutcome of rectal cancer patients) As to the former ,  eitherpre- or post-operative radiation therapy (RT) significantlyreduce loco-regional recurrence ,  post-operative chemotherapy(CT) ,  alone or in different combinations with RT , is effective in improving both disease-free survival andsurvival .
Protocol entry criteria are ,  en-bloc resection of all known tumour ,  a surgical specimen which must be adequate for TNM staging ,  pT3-4 ,  pN0 ,  M0 and pT 1-4 ,  pNl-3 ,  M0 primary rectal adenocarcinoma ,  microscopically negative resection margins .
Eligible patients are enrolled within 40 days after surgery in a multicentre randomized clinical trial with two arms ,  Arm I = post-operative RT ,  Arm II = post-operative RT and CT (5-FU plus levamisole) ,  with stratification by participating institutions .
Within 42 days from surgery ,  patients randomized in Arm I receive RT (50 Gy) in daily fractions of 2 Gy ,  5 days/wk for 5 wk ,  to tumour bed and loco-regional lymph-nodes (internal iliac and presacral nodes) with four portals (LL and AP) .
The primary end-point of the study is overall survival and the expected 5-year survival in RT-treated patients is 50% ,  hence ,  175 patients will be enrolled in each arm to obtain 80% power of the study related to 15% increase of 5-year survival in RT+CT treated patients .
No significant differences as regards sex ,  age ,  performance states ,  type of operation (sphincter-saving resection or abdominoperineal excision of the rectum) ,  pT ,  pN stages of disease ,  number of sampled lymph-nodes ,  and grading were observed in 76 and 73 patients randomized in Arms I and II ,  respectively .
