Introduction .
Loco-regional and distant relapses contribute to impair theoutcome of rectal cancer patients) As to the former ,  eitherpre- or post-operative radiation therapy (RT) significantlyreduce loco-regional recurrence ,  post-operative chemotherapy(CT) ,  alone or in different combinations with RT , is effective in improving both disease-free survival andsurvival .
However ,  many drawbacks still exist regarding themethod of RT delivery as well as the toxicity of combinationadjuvant chemotherapy .
Purpose .
The aim of this trial is to assess the effectiveness and toxicityof adjuvant post-operative RT vs combined RT and CT(5-FU plus levamisole) in patients with TNM stage II-IIIresectable rectal cancer (pT3-4 ,  pN0 ,  M0 ,  pTl-4 ,  pNl-3 , M0) .
The primary endpoint is overall survival ,  secondaryendpoints are disease-free survival ,  rate of loco-regionalrecurrence ,  and treatment-related toxicity/morbidity .
