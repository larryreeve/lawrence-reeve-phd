In first-line chemotherapy ,  fluorouracil with folinic-acid is  better than supportive care (or delayed chemotherapy) for survival and quality of life ,  but the value of second-line chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer has  not yet been proven .
To be eligible for randomisation ,  patients had to meet the following criteria ,  histologically proven metastatic colorectal cancer ,  progressive metastatic disease documented on the basis of either a 25% increase in the size of target lesions or an increase in carcinoembryonic antigen by 1.25 times an initial reference value and a baseline value of more than 10 ug/L ,   which allowed inclusion of patients with non-measurable  disease (peritoneal carcinomatosis and pelvic recurrences) ,   progression documented by two measurements not separated by  more than 6 months and tumour progression while on  fluorouracil or within 6 months of the last fluorouracil infusion ,  having had one adjuvant and/or no more than two palliative  fluorouracil-based regimens ,  age 18-75 years ,  WHO performance status 0.2 ,  neutrophils 2 10/L or more ,  platelets  100x10/L or more ,  total bilirubin 1.25 the institutional upper normal limit (IUNL) ,  or less ,  liver transaminases 3xIUNL (in  case of liver metastases ,  bilirubin <=1.5 IUNL and  transaminases <=5 IUNL) ,  or more ,  serum creatinine  135 umol/L or less ,  wash-out of 4 weeks for radiotherapy or  chemotherapy ,  and written informed consent .
Patients with the following criteria were not eligible ,  previous treatment with topoisomerase I inhibitors ,  bulky disease (involving more than 50% of the liver volume or 25% of the lung volume ,  or abdominal mass >=10 cm) ,  metastases in the  central nervous system ,  or unresolved bowel obstruction or diarrhoea .
In the irinotecan group ,  patients were given best supportive care and irinotecan 350 mg/m ,  diluted in 250 mL normal saline or dextrose ,  over a 90 min intravenous infusion every 3 weeks  (or 300 mg/m if aged >=70 years or WHO performance status 2 ,  according to previously recognised risk factors for developing  toxicity) .
After discontinuation of treatment in the irinotecan group ,  patients were regularly assessed as in the supportive care group  (tumour status ,  symptoms ,  or side-effects ,  every 3 weeks) until  death or for at least a year .
With p=0.05 and power of 0.80 ,  264 patients were  required (176 in the irinotecan group and 88 in the supportive-care group) to show a significant difference in 1-year survival from 20% (supportive care) to 35% (irinotecan) .
189 patients were randomly allocated irinotecan and supportive care and 90 patients were allocated  supportive care alone (figure 1) .
These characteristics were similar for both groups except for performance status (more patients having poor performance status in the supportive-care group were assessed by carcinoembryonic antigen only ,  with mean antigen ratios versus reference values of 2.24 and 2.83 ,  respectively .
Irinotecan was given for a median of 4.1  (0.7-12.6) months and 172 (91%) patients received their  first infusion within 8 days of randomisation. 40 (21%)  patients in the irinotecan group received subsequent  anticancer chemotherapies (31 a fluorouracil regimen ,   nine a drug other than irinotecan) .
In the supportive- care group 28 (31%) of patients received chemotherapy (21 a fluorouracil regimen ,  nine other drugs ,  and one irinotecan). 17 (19%) patients in the supportive-care  group received chemotherapy within 1 month  of randomisation compared with two (1%) in the  irinotecan group .
The survival probability for this group at  6 months was 72.2% ,  at 9 months 52.6% ,  and at  12 months 36.2% .
In this group the survival probability at 6 months was 54.1% ,  at 9 months 29.1% ,  and at 12 months 13.8% .
Patients in the irinotecan group lived significantly longer than those in the supportive-care  group (p=0.0001) .
A univariate Cox's model showed that patients with  performance status 0 or 1 shared the same prognosis ,  which was notably better than that for patients with performance status 2 .
The survival  probability for this group at 6 months was 76.3% ,  at  9 months 57.2% ,  and at 12 months 40.1% .
In this group  the survival probability at 6 months was 62.5% ,  at  9 months 33.2% ,  and at 12 months 16.2% .
The survival probability for  this group at 6 months was 46.2% ,  at 9 months 26.9% ,  and at 12 months 15.4% .
In this group  the survival probability at 6 months was 26.5% ,  at 9 months 15.9% ,  and at 12 months 7.9% .
When the  treatment group was included in the model , the survival benefit for the irinotecan group remained significant (p=0.001) .
Pain-free survival in patients without pain at baseline (figure 4) was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the supportive-care group (p=0.003) ,  despite a higher proportion of patients on opioids in the supportive-care group .
The  survival probability for this group at 6 months was 56.8% ,  at 9 months 36.6% ,  and at 12 months 18.8% .
In this group the survival probability at 6 months was 31.5% ,  at 9 months  14.7% ,  and at 12 months 4.9% .
The univariate analyses of variance were significantly in favour of the irinotecan group for the cognitive functioning score (p.0.001) ,  the global quality-of-life  score (p<0.001) ,  the pain score (p=0.008) ,  dyspnoea  (p=0.04) ,  appetite loss (p<0.002) ,  and financial-impact scores (p<0.001) .
Patients on supportive-care alone experienced a high incidence of severe adverse events ,  especially pain and asthenia ,  although significantly more patients in the irinotecan group experienced severe events ,  especially neutropenia ,  nausea ,  vomiting ,  and diarrhoea .
Admission for adverse events  occurred in 136 (72%) of patients in the irinotecan group and 57 (63%) of patients in the supportive-carealone group for a cumulative median of 15 (range 1.168) days and 11 (2.87) days ,  respectively .
This study showed that treatment with irinotecan and supportive care alone ,  compared with supportive care ,  prolonged the life of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer .
This benefit was clinically meaningful because  the probability of surviving 1 year was 2.6 times greater in patients given irinotecan compared with that of patients given supportive care alone .
