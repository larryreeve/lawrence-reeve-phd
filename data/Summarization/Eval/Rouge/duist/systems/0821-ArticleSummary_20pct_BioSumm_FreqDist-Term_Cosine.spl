MTX has been widely used as a single agent for treatment of head and neck cancer ,  while 5-FU is a major drug for treatment of advanced colorectal and gastric cancer .
Sequential administration of moderate doses of MTX followed by 5-FU has been reported effective in advanced head and neck cancer and colorectal cancer ,  as well as breast cancer ,  but the importance of the sequence remains uncertain .
Patients eligible for this study had measurable or evaluable advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck , adenocarcinoma of the colon ,  rectum or stomach ,  or SCC of other primary site (Table I) .
The inclusion of some patients with previously untreated stage II head and neck cancer reflected the opinion of the combined head and neck clinic that they were unsuitable for cure by surgery or radiotherapy .
Central telephone randomization used balanced blocks stratified only by primary site to assign one of two treatment sequences ,  either MTX followed one hour later by 5-FU (MF). or 5-FU followed .
Among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  disease stage expressed as TNM separately and as stage grouping ,  using standard definitions of the American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging and- End Result reporting were also examined as possible prognostic factors for response and survival .
For previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  stage was included either as stage group or as TNM stage separately .
For previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  stage expressed as either stage group or as T ,  N ,  and M stage ,  separately and with two and three-way interactions were also included .
This was most extreme among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  of this subgroup 65% responded to the sequence of MF ,  while 39% of entered patients including 47% of those evaluable for response ,  responded to the reverse FM sequence (P = .18 ,  Fisher's exact test) .
Because most responding patients with head and neck cancer received radiotherapy while still in response ,  no meaningful response duration could be determined ,  instead survival times are presented (Table 3) ,  with a median survival of at least 13 months in all groups .
Patients with head and neck cancer had significantly longer survival than those with other primary sites (P < .001) ,  reflecting the relatively earlier stage at which chemotherapy was used in head and neck cancer .
Survival duration was not significantly different by treatment sequence in univariate analyses ,  though the trend favored the sequence of 5-FU before MTX ,  in which the median survival had not been reached at 23 months ,  compared to a median survival of 13.3 months in the group receiving MTX before 5-FU .
Cox model multivariate analysis showed that ECOG performance status at study entry was the most significant prognostic factor for survival duration (P < .001) ,  and that ,  among the 70 patients with head and neck cancer ,  when allowance was made for performance status ,  a survival difference in favor of the "reverse" FM sequence emerged (P < .025) .
Because the question at issue was the sequence of drug administration rather than the study of a particular tumor type ,  we chose to include patients with SCCs of the head and neck ,  colorectal or gastric adenocarcinoma ,  and other SCCs reasonably treated by either MTX or 5-FU .
In the small number of patients with colorectal cancer we observed a response rate of 33% (40% of evaluable patients) ,  a figure somewhat higher than that usually seen after 5-FU as a single agent ,  but the 95% confidence limits for this rate (19%-64%) emphasize that this could be a chance observation .
The median survival from the start of chemotherapy was short (4.6 months) with no significant difference between the two treatment sequences in response rate or survival duration (Table 3) .
Browman et al have conducted a similar trial in which patients with head and neck cancer were randomized to receive MTX followed one hour later by 5-FU or the same two drugs given simultaneously .
