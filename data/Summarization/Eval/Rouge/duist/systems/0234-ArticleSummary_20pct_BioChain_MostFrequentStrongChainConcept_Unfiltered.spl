Epirubicin (4'-epi-doxorubicin ,  EPI) is one such compound .
The antitumor activity of EPI in animal models is similar to that of DOX ,  but EPI is a less toxic compound with regard to both cytotoxicity and cardiac injury .
In the mouse ,  EPI and DOX have similar patterns of distribution to various tissues ,  although drug levels are lower in heart and spleen with EPI .
Pharmacokinetic studies in tumor-bearing mice and rats indicate that EPI is more extensively metabolized by liver than DOX .
The two compounds have similar pharmacokinetic behavior in humans ,  although EPI is eliminated more rapidly .
In two clinical phase I studies ,  EPI was found to have acceptable toxicity at doses of 85 to 90 mg/m2 given intravenously (IV) every three weeks .
Other criteria for eligibility included a performance status of - 50% (Karnofsky scale) ,  a WBC count - 4,000/14L ,  a platelet count >- 100,000/L ,  normal serum bilirubin levels ( < 1.5 mg/dL) ,  and objectively evaluable or measurable disease .
All patients were then randomly assigned to receive either EPI or DOX .
Treatment ProtocolEPI was supplied by Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Milan ,  Italy) in a powdered form that was reconstituted with sterile water for injection United States Pharmacopeia .
Both EPI and DOX were administered by slow (five minute) injections through an established IV line every three weeks .
The dose of EPI was 85 mg/m2 ,  and the dose of DOX was 60 mg/m2 .
Evaluation of ToxicityThe percent of projected dose received was calculated for each patient as the average of all doses the patient received (mg/m 2) - 85 if the patient was randomized to EPI and - 60 if the patient was randomized to DOX .
Cardiac toxicity was assessed in all patients by both clinical evaluation and RNCA .
Antineoplastic therapy was discontinued if the LVEF decreased to < 40% or if the patient developed clinical congestive heart failure .
In addition ,  four patients who received EPI and six who received DOX had a history of wellcontrolled systemic arterial hypertension .
The median WBC nadir was 2.0 x 103/gL (range ,  0.1 to 8.6) and the median platelet nadir was 132 x 103//pL (range ,  20.0 to 279.0) in patients receiving EPI ,  the median WBC nadir was 1.8 x 10'/3tL (range ,  0.3 to .9) and median platelet nadir was 130 x 103/pL (range 24.0 to 253.0) in patients on the DOX arm .
One patient receiving EPI died of nadir sepsis .
Nausea or vomiting was documented in 58% of patients who received EPI and 67% of the patients who were treated with DOX .
The median cumulative dose to laboratory cardiotoxicity in these patients was 892 mg/m2 of EPI and 360 mg/m 2 of DOX .
The median dose to development of cardiotoxicity for all evaluable patients was 935 mg/m2 for EPI and 468 mg/m2 for DOX (Fig 2A) .
Overall ,  100% of the planned dose of EPI (85 mg/m2) was administered ,  however ,  only 86% (52 mg/m2) of the planned dose of DOX was given .
Thus ,  all EPI doses were multiplied by 52/85 to compare the two drugs in equivalent units ,  and Kaplan-Meier estimates plotted (Fig 2B) .
Thus ,  even accounting for the difference in myelosuppressive potency ,  EPI is less cardiotoxic than DOX .
Four patients treated with EPI and five patients treated with DOX developed clinical congestive heart failure (CHF) .
The cumulative doses of EPI at which clinical CHF was observed (1,035 ,  1,105 ,  1,162 ,  and 1,234 mg/m 2) were approximately twice the cumulative doses of DOX at which CHF was seen (456 ,  480 ,  492 ,  560 ,  and 600 mg/m2) .
There was a statistically significant greater cumulative dose to CHF for patients receiving EPI (log rank test ,  P - .008) with and without adjustment for the difference in myelosuppressive potency .
Since only five patients treated with DOX and four treated with EPI actually developed clinical heart failure ,  this result should not be overinterpreted .
Among patients who experienced clinical CHF ,  however ,  the median cumulative doses to CHF were 1,134 mg/m2 of EPI and 492 mg/m 2 of DOX .
DISCUSSIONIn this study ,  EPI had therapeutic activity in breast cancer similar to DOX ,  but produced less cardiotoxicity than the parent compound .
Although empiric dose restriction is widely practiced ,  many patients experience the onset of CHF before they receive 550 mg/m2 of the drug .
In a prospective adjuvant chemotherapy trial for patients with soft-tissue sarcomas ,  14% of patients who received 430 to 600 mg/m2 of DOX developed clinical CHF .
Structurally ,  EPI differsvery slightly from DOX and has the same molecular weight ,  yet EPI and DOX have different therapeutic ,  myelosuppressive ,  and  cardiotoxic potencies in animal systems .
This suggests that EPI might have a better therapeutic index in patients with cancer .
In the present trial ,  EPI was compared with its parent compound in terms of both toxicity and antitumor efficacy .
On a molar basis ,  EPI was clearly less myelosuppressive than DOX ,  EPI was also less cardiotoxic .
The difference in cardiac toxicity was manifested by the difference in total cumulative dose at which changes in LVEF occurred (Fig 2A) ,  as well as by the difference in dose at which clinical CHF was seen (EPI ,  1,035 to 1,234 mg/m 2 v DOX ,  456 to 600 mg/m2) .
Expressed more plainly ,  is EPI a less cardiotoxic anthracycline ,  or merely a less potent anthracycline? .
A third study34 compared two multidrug combinations in which 5-fluorouracil (F) 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide (C) 500 mg/m2 were combined with an equal dosage (50 mg/m2) of either EPI (FEC [5-fluorouracil ,  EPI ,  cyclophosphamidel) or DOX (FAC) and administered every three weeks ,  the total dose of EPI was limited to 750 mg/m2 and of DOX to 550 mg/m2 .
Most patients in our trials received less than 550 mg/m2 of EPI ,  however ,  in 11 patients receiving cumulative EPI doses from 550 to 1,465 mg/m2 ,  RNCA abnormalities were observed in only four patients at 970 ,  1,180,1,190 ,  and 1,465 mg/m2 ,  respectively (C.W .
Our results show that EPI has therapeutic activity that is similar to that of DOX in patients with advanced breast cancer ,  and that EPI is a less cardiotoxic drug than DOX ,  even accounting for the difference in myelosuppressive potency .
