We randomly assigned patients irinotecan combined with fluorouracil and calcium folinate (irinotecan group) or fluorouracil and calcium folinate only (no-irinotecan group ,  figure 1) .
We needed to include 338 evaluable patients to show a significant difference in response rate between treatment groups ,  assuming response rates of 35% in the no-irinotecan group and 50% in the irinotecan group ,  by use of two-tailed X tests (a=0.05 ,  power 0.80) .
Based on the assumption that time to progression would be 6 months in the no-irinotecan group and 9 months in the irinotecan group ,  we calculated that 286 patients were needed to show a significant difference for this variable .
Of the 385 patients treated in the study ,  only 97 (25%) received treatment by the weekly regimen (54 in the irinotecan group and 43 in the no-irinotecan group) .
The other 288 patients received treatment every 2 weeks (145 in the irinotecan group and 143 in the no-irinotecan group) .
A higher proportion of women were assigned fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone than the irinotecan regimen ,  and the rectum was the primary tumour site in a higher proportion of patients in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group .
Tumour characteristics and history in the two groups were comparable ,  except for previous surgery ,  since 89% of patients had had surgery in the irinotecan group and 95% in the no-irinotecan group .
39.4% of patients in the irinotecan group and 58.3% in the no-irinotecan group received further chemotherapy; The median time to onset of response was 8.9 (range 4.7-25.4) weeks in the irinotecan group medians.21 The probability of survival in the irinotecan group was 84.9% at 9 months and 75.5% at 12 months ,  and in the no-irinotecan group was 77.3% and 62.7% ,  respectively .
The median duration of response was 9.3 (2.8-13.1) months in the irinotecan group and 8.8 (3.7-11.8) months in the no-irinotecan group (p=0.08) .
Time to progression was longer in the irinotecan than in the noirinotecan group (median 6.7 [0+.13.8+] vs 4.4 group and the no-irinotecan group ,  33.1% (95% CI 25.5-41.4) and 21.0% (14.6-28.6 ,  p=0.021); the Survival in the irinotecan group was significantly longer hazard ratio for response was 2.6 times higher in the than in the no-irinotecan group (median 17.4 [0.4-28.4+] irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group ,  given the same degree of weight loss at baseline and the same time between first diagnosis and first metastasis .
There was insufficient power to compare the efficacy risk of progression for a patient in the no-irinotecan group was increased by about 69% compared with that for a patient in the irinotecan group when all other variables were equal .
The median time to treatment failure was 5.3 (0.4-15.7+) months in the irinotecan group and 3.8 (0.4-11.5+) months in the no-irinotecan group (p=0.0014) .
The time to definitive deterioration in performance status was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group (median 11.2 [0.1+.15.7+]) vs 9.9 [0+.13ÿ¿¿¿¿¿ÿ¿¿¿¿¿6+] months ,  p=0.046; With the 2-weekly regimen ,  diarrhoea was more frequent in the irinotecan group than in the noirinotecan group ,  and the difference was close to siginificance in the weekly regimen .
Among patients receiving the weekly regimen ,  diarrhoea led to hospital admission for 17 (31.5%) in the irinotecan group and five (11.6%) in the no-irinotecan group .
For the 2-weekly regimen ,  16 (11.0%) patients in the irinotecan group and two (1.4%) in the no-irinotecan group were admitted for diarrhoea .
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and leukopenia were significantly more frequent in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group ,  irrespective of regimen .
Asthenia was the second most frequent nonhaematological toxic effect in the irinotecan group ,  and grade 3 or 4 asthenia was significantly more frequent in this group than in the no-irinotecan group for the 2-weekly regimen .
Grade 3 or 4 infection without grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was significantly more frequent in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group .
The rate of return was similar in the two treatment groups.62% in the irinotecan group and 59% in the no-irinotecan group .
Another phase III study that compared irinotecan combined with bolus fluorouracil and fluorouracil alone consistently provided significantly higher response rates (33 vs 18% ,  p<0.001) and median time to treatment failure (5.0 vs 3.8 months ,  p<0.05) in the irinotecan group .
