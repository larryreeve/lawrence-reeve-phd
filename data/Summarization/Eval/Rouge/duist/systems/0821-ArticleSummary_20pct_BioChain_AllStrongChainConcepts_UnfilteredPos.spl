The two drugs have been used together clinically on empirical grounds for some time ,  particularly in the treatment of breast cancer ,  but data from experimental tumors in vivo and in vitro document both synergistic and antagonistic interactions .
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. leukocyte count >3.0 x 10/L ,  platelet count > 100 x 10/L and adequate renal function (scrum creatinine <90 umol/L or creatinine clearance > 1.0 mL/sec) were required .
In either case ,  the dose of MTX was 250 mg/m2 ,  and the dose of 5-FU was 600 mg/m2 .
Statistical analysis used BMDP statistical software to prepare and compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves (program BMDPIL) for the group as a whole and for subgroups by primary site ,  treatment sequence ,  performance status ,  sex ,  age group ,  and response to therapy .
Among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  disease stage expressed as TNM separately and as stage grouping ,  using standard definitions of the American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging and- End Result reporting were also examined as possible prognostic factors for response and survival .
Standard WHO definitions of response categories and toxicity grades were followed .
Chi square and Fisher's exact tests of the significance of differences in proportions responding to each treatment sequence were performed using standard formulas .
For previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  stage expressed as either stage group or as T ,  N ,  and M stage ,  separately and with two and three-way interactions were also included .
Four patients ,  two on each treatment sequence ,  died of treatment-related complications (sepsis in two patients ,  diarrhea in one ,  and aspiration pneumonia in one patient) ,  and a further patient developed prolonged neurologic toxicity with coma but recovered fully .
Response categories and median survival durations are summarized in Table 3 .
Both treatment sequences were effective in head and neck cancer ,  producing an overall major response rate (complete and partial) of 46% of all entered patients ,  including 52% (95% confidence limits ,  39%-65%) of evaluable patients .
Even if the most extreme case is assumed and all four nonevaluable patients regarded as nonresponders ,  the difference was still not significant (P = .06 ,  Fisher's exact test ,  with no allowance for multiple comparisons) .
Because most responding patients with head and neck cancer received radiotherapy while still in response ,  no meaningful response duration could be determined ,  instead survival times are presented (Table 3) ,  with a median survival of at least 13 months in all groups .
Survival duration was not significantly different by treatment sequence in univariate analyses ,  though the trend favored the sequence of 5-FU before MTX ,  in which the median survival had not been reached at 23 months ,  compared to a median survival of 13.3 months in the group receiving MTX before 5-FU .
Cox model multivariate analysis showed that ECOG performance status at study entry was the most significant prognostic factor for survival duration (P < .001) ,  and that ,  among the 70 patients with head and neck cancer ,  when allowance was made for performance status ,  a survival difference in favor of the "reverse" FM sequence emerged (P < .025) .
We therefore conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of sequential MTX followed one hour later by 5-FU versus the same drugs administered one hour apart but in the opposite order .
The median survival from the start of chemotherapy was short (4.6 months) with no significant difference between the two treatment sequences in response rate or survival duration (Table 3) .
