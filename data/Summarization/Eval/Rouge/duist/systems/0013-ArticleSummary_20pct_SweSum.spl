The principal toxicity of mitolactol is hematologic ,  while that of cisplatin is nonhematologic .
The combination of DAG and cisplatin has previously been studied .
Since there were only 18 assessable patients , the study was too small for definitive conclusions .
A pilot study used mitolactol plus cisplatin and established a tolerable dose schedule of 180 mg/m of mitolactoldaily for 5 days with cisplatin 50 mg/m .
Although an intermediate dose level (50 mg/m cisplatin and 225mg/m mitolactol daily for 5 days) was considered ,  it wasnot pursued ,  since six of 10 patients at the first dose level in the pilot study required dose reductions and/or delays with re-treatment .
Treatment of cervix cancer with the combination of ifosfamide ,  cisplatin ,  and bleomycin yielded a 69% response rate (49 patients) in one series .
The result was impressive ,  but the importance of bleomycin was unclear and its toxicity sometimes troublesome ,  so we proposed to compare cisplatin alone versus a regimen of cisplatinplus mitolactol (C + M) and a regimen of cisplatin plusifosfamide (and mesna) (CIFX) .
PATIENTS AND METHODS .
Patients were prospectively stratified according to whether they had received prior radiation-sensitizer treatment (hydroxyurea ,  cisplatin , or fluorouracil) and by PS ,  and were then centrally randomized with equal probability to receive (1) cisplatin 50 mg/m with appropriate hydration every 3 weeks for a maximum of six courses ,  or (2) cisplatin 50 mg/m on day 1 plus mitolactol (180 mg/m orally for 5 days) on days 2 through 6 every 3 weeks ,  or (3) cisplatin 50mg/m plus ifosfamide 5.0 g/m over 24 hours plus mesna 6 g/m given concurrently with ifosfamide and for 12 hours after ,  every 3 weeks ,  again for a maximum of six courses .
Ten patients did not receive the randomized study treatment .
Thus ,  there were 140 eligible patients on the cisplatin arm ,  147 on the C + M arm ,  and 151 onthe CIFX arm .
There was a significantly greater frequency of response(31.1%) among patients treated with CIFX compared with cisplatin alone (17.8%; P = .004; Table 4) .
There was no significant difference in survival between cisplatin and either of the combination regimens (median[months]: cisplatin ,  8.0; C + M ,  7.3; CIFX ,  8.3; P =.835) (Fig 2) .
As a consequence ,  a subset of patients in the present study had such a prior history (Table 1) .
A phase II trial of bleomycin plus ifosfamide plus cisplatin that used the same dose schedules of CIFX as in the present trial achieved a 20% CR rate .
There is a paucity of phase III chemotherapy trials in advanced cervix cancer .
The methotrexate ,  vinblastine ,  doxorubicin , cisplatin (MVAC) regimen ,  popularized in the treatment of transitional cell bladder cancer ,  has recently been reported to be active in cervix cancer .
Cisplatin alone has limited value in advanced cervix cancer; we are not aware of a randomized trial of cisplatin versus supportive care .
In contrast ,  the present trial ,  which used cisplatin 50 mg/m2 plus ifosfamide ,  has shown an impact on PFS .
