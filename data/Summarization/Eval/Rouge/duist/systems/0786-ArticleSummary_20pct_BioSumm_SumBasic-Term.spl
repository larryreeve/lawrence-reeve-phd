Although the superiority of combination radiotherapy and chemotherapy with fluorouracil(5-FU) and semustine (MeCCNU) was clearly shown in terms of both disease-free survival and ,  subsequently , overall survival ,  the clinical impact of such treatment was tempered by the inclusion of MeCCNU in an adjuvant setting .
The leukemogenic effect of MeCCNU was established subsequent to the initiation of GI 7175 ,  indeed ,  one patient who participated in GI 7175 developed acute myeloid leukemia after MeCCNU therapy .
The same postradiation regimen of 5-FU and MeCCNU as that used in GI 7175 was chosen for one arm ,  with the exception that the duration of treatment with postradiation 5-FU and MeCCNU was reduced from 18 months to 12 months in an attempt to reduce the leukemogenic potential of the MeCCNU .
An escalating single-agent 5-FU regimen incorporating a theoretical maximum-tolerated dose was chosen as the alternative treatment option based on clinical evidence suggesting a dose response curve for 5-FU and pilot data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggesting added efficacy of 5-FU when given at higher dose levels .
Patients must have recovered from the acute effects of surgery ,  been capable of starting treatment within 60 days after resection ,  had no evidence of active infection ,  had adequate performance and nutritional status to tolerate protocol treatment ,  and had no preexisting or concurrent malignant tumors except basal cell or superficial squamous cell carcinomas of the skin .
Presence of ascites ,  peritoneal seeding ,  residual pelvic tumor ,  positive paraaortic lymph node biopsy ,  or distant metastases excluded patients from study ,  as did previous chemotherapy or pelvic irradiation or any active and significant coexistent disease that ,  in the judgment of the investigator ,  would make the risks of chemotherapy or radiation therapy prohibitive .
Normal hepatic ,  renal ,  and bone marrow function (ie ,  bilirubin level < 2.5 mg/dL ,  BUN level< 25 mg/dL ,  or creatinine level < 1.5 mg/dL ,  leukocyte and platelet counts > 4,500/uL and 125,000/uL ,  respectively) must have been documented before study entry .
Patients considered eligible received a full explanation of the purpose ,  procedures ,  and risks of the study ,  signed a statement of informed consent approved by the local institutional review board ,  and were then randomized by telephoning a central coordinating center .
The superior border of the field was to be the top of the fifth lumbar vertebral body ,  the lateral border 2 cm lateral to the true pelvic side wall ,  and the inferior margin of the field was to be determined clinically .
All patients were to receive intravenous 5-FU 500 mg/m given in a rapid infusion on the first 3 days and last 3 days of radiation therapy .
Second and subsequent courses were to be given on the same schedule but with the dose of 5-FU increased to 325 mg/m intravenously ,  days 1 to 5,375 mg/m2 ,  days 36 to 40 ,  and MeCCNU to 130 mg/m orally on day 1 .
During postradiotherapy chemotherapy ,  moderate or severe nausea or vomiting required a 50% dose reduction of all chemotherapy for one course ,  mild stomatitis or diarrhea ,  continued but not escalated therapy ,  and moderate or worse stomatitis ,  reduction of the next course of chemotherapy by 25% .
Dose reductions of 5-FU by 25% were required for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU treatment arm who experienced a leukocyte count nadir of below 2,000/UL during the first 3 weeks .
Repetition of severe marrow depression (leukocyte count < 1,500/UL) or thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 25,000/UL) after dose reduction or persistent leukopenia (leukocyte count < 4,000/UL) or thrombocytopenia (< 100,000/UL) at 10 weeks after the last dose of MeCCNU disqualified a patient from any further treatment with MeCCNU .
Central review of radiotherapy treatment records including contour and isodose curves ,  dosimetry calculations ,  simulation films ,  verification films for each port displaying treatment fields ,  and dose prescription was conducted by Dr P.R.M .
Gastrointestinal series and small bowel follow-up were to be performed at 12 months and barium enema and proctoscopy (if rectum is in place) at 6 ,  12 ,  and 18 months ,  and then annually .
Despite early termination of accrual due to loss of funding ,  the results of this study provide important information regarding the potential effectiveness of the escalating 5-FU regimen compared with a MeCCNU-containing regimen .
Using the techniques of Makuch and Simon ,  it can be shown that a sample size of 100 patients per arm has an 80% power to exclude differences in treatments as great as .19 assuming a = .05 and a 30-month rate of .65 .
Eleven patients (six receiving 5-FUand MeCCNU and five receiving escalating 5-FU) ,  comprising 5% of the registered population ,  are not included in the primary analysis as they were determined to be ineligible by an independent review .
Although the protocol required treatment to begin within 60 days of surgery ,  20 patients evenly distributed between the two treatment arms began treatment more than 60 days postsurgery ,  16 of the 20 individuals received their initial therapy within 64 days .
Of the 199 patients who comprised the cohort for primary analysis ,  95 were randomized to receive postradiation 5-FU and MeCCNU ,  and 104 were randomized to receive postradiation escalating 5-FU .
Selected patient characteristics show that 58% had disease extension involving the perirectal fat with at least one positive lymph node ,  60% of patients are male ,  and 59% underwent an abdominal-perineal resection (Table 1) .
Patients randomized to 5-FU and MeCCNU received a median total dose of MeCCNU of.37 g/m2 (25% < the planned level of .49 g/m) ,  and a median of .08 g/m of MeCCNU per 10-week course .
Toxicities experienced by patients on the two arms are comparable ,  53% of patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNUarm (52 of 99) and 50% of those assigned to the escalating 5-FU arm (54 of 107) experienced at least one episode of severe or worse toxicity as defined by the GITSG toxicity scale .
Permanent interruption of all therapy due to toxicity occurred in 11% of 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 14% of escalating5-FU patients .
Six patients are reported to have experienced severe (three) or life-threatening (three) treatment-related intestinal obstructions ,  two receiving the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen and four on escalating 5-FU (Table 2) .
The probability of 3-year disease-free survival on the two arms is 54% and 68% for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and the escalating 5-FU arm ,  respectively ,  median time to recurrenceis estimated to be 4 years and greater than 4 years ,  respectively (Fig 1) .
When included in the Cox model ,  Dukes stage ,  resection type ,  distance to the nearest margin (<= 3 cm v other) ,  and the interaction between resection type and distance to the nearest margin were found to be significant without adjustment for multiple comparisons in predicting disease-free survival(P < .05) .
In fact ,  the adjusted relative risk (RR) for tumor recurrence associated with the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm is 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] ,  .84 to 1.66) ,  when considered individually without adjustment for covariates ,  it is estimated to be 1.30 (95% CI , .87 to 1.94) .
Eighty-one of the deaths were attributed to progressive disease ,  and one death was reported without documented cause ,  the causes of death for the remaining nine patients were attributed to treatment (two patients ,  discussed above) ,  myocardial infarctions (five , three of whom had a suspected recurrence) ,  stroke (one) ,  and metastatic disease resulting from a new primary tumor arising in the bile duct (one) .
As in the disease-free analysis ,  secondary analyses of survival considering either all patients randomized or only patients who received treatment after the completion of radiation therapy ,  resulted in no meaningful change in direction or magnitude of the RR attributed to treatment with the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen (RR = 1.10 ,  95% CI ,  .72 to 1.67 ,  and RR = 1.04 ,  95% CI ,  .65 to 1.67 ,  respectively) .
A stage-wise comparison of the results of this study with GI 7175 in which the same staging criteria of GI 7175 were applied to GI 7180 shows that reducing the chemotherapeutic regimen of 5-FU and MeCCNU from 18 months to 12 months did not significantly alter the survival outcome for patients .
The results of this study indicate that treatment after surgical resection of Dukes B2 and C rectal cancer with escalating 5-FU postradiation therapy provides similar survival and recurrence outcomes as a postradiation chemotherapeutic regimen including the leukemogen MeCCNU .
Fewer recurrences involving distant sites occurred on the escalating 5-FU arm compared with the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm ,  further suggesting that MeCCNU is not an essential component of the postradiation chemotherapy treatment .
The results of the present study confirm the expected survival and disease-free survival probabilities observed in the combination therapy arm of the previous GITSG study ,  while the recent report by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) further demonstrates the advantage of combination radiation therapy and chemotherapy compared with radiation therapy alone in reducing recurrence rates and improving survival .
Although data from the initial rectal cancer adjuvant trial conducted by the National Surgical Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP RO1) suggested improved survival and disease-free survival in patients treated with chemotherapy alone compared with surgery alone ,  that study did not include a combined modality treatment arm .
Furthermore ,  studies in metastatic colorectal disease demonstrating enhanced efficacy of 5-FU when administered with leucovorin ,  as well as a recent report indicating a reduction in the rate of recurrence in colon cancer when levamisole was added to adjuvant 5-FU ,  have led to an intergroup trial assessing the value of such combinations as adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer (Intergroup Rectal Adjuvant protocol ,  Int 0114 ,  activated August 1990) .
