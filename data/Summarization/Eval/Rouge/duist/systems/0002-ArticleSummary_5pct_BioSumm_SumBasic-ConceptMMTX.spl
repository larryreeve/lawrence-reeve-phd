At the time we were developing the protocol used in the current study ,  radiotherapy plus concomitant chemotherapy with hydroxyurea was the standard combined-therapy regimen for advanced cervical cancer ,  because an early analysis of the combination of radiation ,  cisplatin ,  and fluorouracil failed to show improved progression-free survival .
Therefore ,  we undertook a randomized study in which all women with locally advanced cervical cancer received local radiation as well as weekly concomitant treatment with cisplatin alone ,  the combination of cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  or hydroxyurea alone .
Patients were required to have a Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status of 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  or 3 (equivalent to Karnofsky performance scores of 90 or 100 ,  70 or 80 ,  50 or 60 ,  and 30 or 40 ,  respectively) and to have no history of other cancers .
Other eligibility criteria were as follows ,  a leukocyte count of at least 3000 per cubic millimeter ,  a platelet count of at least 100,000 per cubic millimeter ,  a serum creatinine level of no more than 2.0 mg per deciliter (177 umol per liter) ,  a serum bilirubin level that was no more than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal at the institution where it was measured ,  and a serum aspartate aminotransferase level that was no more than 3 times the upper limit of normal at the institution where it was measured .
Forty-nine of these patients (9 percent) were subsequently found to be ineligible for the following reasons ,  because of deviations from the surgical protocol for the evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (44 patients) ,  ineligible stage of disease (2) ,  metastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes (1) ,  incorrect primary diagnosis (1) ,  and incomplete pretreatment testing (1) .
The median delay in administering radiotherapy was computed for the 455 patients who received doses within 15 percent of the prescribed dose to both points A and B .
The effects of chemotherapy should not interfere with the planned course of radiation ,  and one advantage of cisplatin is that it has limited adverse effects on bone marrow .
In a phase 3 trial conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group ,  388 patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy either with cisplatin and fluorouracil or with hydroxyurea (Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) ,  the two-drug regimen improved survival (relative risk of death ,  0.74 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.58 to 0.95) .
