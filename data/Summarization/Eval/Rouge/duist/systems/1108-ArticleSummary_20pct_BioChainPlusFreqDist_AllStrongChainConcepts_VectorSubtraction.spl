THE American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics define stage IB cervical cancer as invasive cancer that is confined to the cervix ,  with a depth of more than 5 mm and a width of more than 7 mm. In patients with large stage IB cervical cancers ,  local control and survival are poorer than in patients with smaller stage I cancers ,  whether treated by surgery or irradiation .
The optimal treatment of large stage IB cervical cancer has been a source of controversy since the late 1960s .
Extraperitoneal surgical staging of lymph nodes was optional .
Patients with histologic evidence of lymph-node involvementwere not eligible ,  nor were those who had previously received radiotherapy or chemotherapy or those with a history of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer .
Fractions of 1.8 to 2.0 Gy were delivered 5 days a week over a period of 4 1/2 to 5 weeks ,  for a total dose of 45 Gy .
The final dose could be given during a patient’s hospitalization for intracavitary brachytherapy .
Quality Control and Follow-up .
Randomization was carried out by a block arrangement ,  the treatment assignments were stratified according to center and to whether para-aortic lymph nodes were evaluated surgically ,  with approximately equal numbers of patients assigned to each group .
The difference between groups in survival and progression-free survival was evaluated with use of the logrank test according to the intention-to-treat principle .
Differences between groups in the severity of adverse effects and the frequency of hysterectomy specimens that were negative for cancer were evaluated with use of Pearson’s chi-square test .
To simplify presentation ,  the P values were not adjusted for the results of the two interim analyses .
RESULTS .
Three of these patients had been randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone ,  and two had been assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin .
One patient assigned to receive radiotherapy alone and two patients assigned to receive radiotherapyand cisplatin refused to undergo radiotherapy .
The frequency of grade 1 (minimal) and grade 2 (mild) genitourinary and neurologic adverse effects was higher in the combined-therapy group .
Progression-free Survival .
The disease recurred in 69 patients in the group given radiotherapy alone (37 percent) and 38 patients given radiotherapy and cisplatin (21 percent) (Table 4) .
Survival .
One patient who received cisplatin died after an automobile accident ,  she had no evidence of cancer at her last examination .
The treatment of women with bulky stage IB cervical cancers has historically been only partially satisfactory ,  with survival rates of 70 to 75 percent ,  substantially below the rates of 88 to 92 percent expected with smaller stage IB cancers .
The use of extrafascial hysterectomy after radiotherapy has gradually been abandoned ,  but there has continued to be disagreement about the value of the operation .
Like others ,  we found that the size of the tumor was an important prognostic factor .
Weekly treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy has been assessed in several phase 2 studies .
The promising results of these studies as well as the fact that this combination is well tolerated and easy to administer on an outpatient basis led us to evaluate it in this trial .
The results of a subsequent trial involving similar patients are reported by Rose et al. in this issue of the Journal .
In our trial the only difference in the protocols for the two groups was the use of weekly infusions of cisplatin during radiotherapy for bulky stage IB cervical cancers .
Of the 369 eligible patients in our study who were scheduled to undergo hysterectomy after the completion of radiotherapy ,  93 percent did undergo the surgery .
The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment ,  but they share a common result ,  all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin .
