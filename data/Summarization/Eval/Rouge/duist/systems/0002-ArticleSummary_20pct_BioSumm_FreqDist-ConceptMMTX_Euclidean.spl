CERVICAL cancer is the second most frequent cancer among women worldwide and the most frequent cancer among women in Africa ,  Asia ,  and South America .
Radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea has been compared in separate trials with radiotherapy alone ,  with radiotherapy and concomitant therapy with misonidazole ,  and with radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil (and Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) .
In addition ,  the responses in phase 2 trials of this chemotherapy regimen with radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer and in patients with head and neck cancer were favorable .
METHODS .
Eligibility .
The institutions that participated in the study are listed in the Appendix .
All cancers were confirmed histologically by the Gynecologic Oncology Group pathology committee .
If intracavitary brachytherapy could not be delivered ,  the tumor was treated with additional external-beam radiotherapy ,  for a total dose of 61.2 Gy .
Interstitial and high-dose brachytherapy were not allowed .
The duration of the radiotherapy was 10 weeks .
The Radiological Physics Center in Houston reviewed all technical aspects of radiotherapy and verified the calibration of the instruments used .
Treatment with hydroxyurea or fluorouracil was discontinued if the leukocyte count dropped below 3000 per cubic millimeter or the platelet count dropped below 100,000 per cubic millimeter ,  and it was resumed once the counts rose above these levels .
Treatment with cisplatin was discontinued if the leukocyte count dropped below 2500 per cubic millimeter or the platelet count dropped below 50,000 per cubic millimeter ,  and it was resumed once the counts rose above these levels .
Statistical Analysis .
Randomization was carried out by a block arrangement ,  the treatment assignments were stratified according to center and the three clinical stages of disease ,  with approximately equal numbers assigned to each treatment group .
Life-table estimates were calculated according to the method of Kaplan and Meier ,  and differences in progression-free survival were evaluated with use of the log-rank test according to the intention-to-treat principle .
Pearson's chi-square test was used to detect differences in the incidence of adverse effects among treatment regimens .
The performance of these interim tests raised the type I error by only 0.05 percent .
Because of this negligible increase and to simplify the presentation ,  the P values were not adjusted for the results of the interim analyses .
Characteristics of the Patients .
There were no significant differences in the clinical characteristics among the three treatment groups (Table 2) .
Site of Progression .
There were no treatment-related deaths .
DISCUSSION .
Thus ,  locoregional control must be improved .
Many combinations of cisplatin have been studied in phase 2 trials of patients with cervical cancer .
The radiation protocol that we used allowed a total dose of 81 Gy to be delivered to point A and anticipated a total treatment time of 10 weeks .
In our study ,  the duration of radiotherapy and the dose of radiation were similar among the three regimens , implying that the differences in progression-free survival and survival were related to the chemotherapy .
Treatment with cisplatin alone was less toxic than treatment with the three-drug regimen .
