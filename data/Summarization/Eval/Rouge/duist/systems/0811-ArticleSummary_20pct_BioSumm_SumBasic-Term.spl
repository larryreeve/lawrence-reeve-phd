Nevertheless ,  there is little evidence of effective therapy for such patients other than symptomatic and supportive care. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is considered by many as the standard of chemotherapy ,  but in larger experiences with this agent ,  response rates have only been in the 15% to 20% range .
A hope frequently pursued in clinical research has been that the activity of 5-FU can be enhanced either by adding the activity of other cytotoxic drugs or ,  more recently ,  by favorably modulating the effects of 5-FU itself .
The purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate ,  by such a randomized and controlled comparison ,  a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5-FU activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials .
Studies by Woodcock et al ,  by Kirkwood and Frei ,  and by Vogel et a1 demonstrated that in humans ,  pretreatment with thymidine increased the biologic activity of 5-FU up to eight-fold as measured by hematologic toxicity .
Overall therapeutic results were discouraging ,  specifically in colorectal cancer ,  a Mayo Clinic study demonstrated only one response among 30 patients ,  a study of the Baltimore Cancer Research Program showed no responses among 21 patients ,  and a New York Memorial study demonstrated only two minor responses among 19 evaluated patients .
Continued interest in PALA ,  however ,  was stimulated by animal model evidence that this agent inhibits pyrimidine synthesis and thereby enhances 5-FU activity by increasing its conversion to fluorouridine monophosphate (FUMP) .
In the phase 2 trial of Bedikian et al ,  a relatively discouraging 14% response rate was recorded among 50 patients ,  but an additional 54% were stated to have achieved "disease stabilization." .
The second study ,  conducted at the University of Wisconsin (Madison) ,  showed that advanced-disease patients treated with combined 5-FU and levamisole lived significantly longer than patients treated with 5-FU alone .
In a randomized trial ,  this group showed that this combination produced superior response rates and survival when compared with their own variant of the 5-FU ,  methyl CCNU ,  vincristine combination .
An exception to the requirement for histologic confirmation of metastasis was made in the patient with a previous histologically confirmed primary colorectal carcinoma and who presented with multiple pulmonary metastasis that had shown progression on two chest x-rays taken at least 1 month apart .
A radioactive liver scan could be used to document a measurable lesion if there was a clearly defined perfusion defect measuring at least 5 cm in greatest diameter .
Contraindications to selection included a WBC count < 4.000/mm or a platelet count < 130.000/mm. a serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL. complete disability (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group IECOG] performance score 4). recent major surgery (exploration and biopsy only. < 14 days ,  resection or bypass surgery ,  < 21 days) ,  an uncontrolled infectious process. frequent vomiting or severe anorexia ,  any previous chemotherapy ,  and intensive radiation to the axial skeleton within the preceding 4 weeks .
After determining eligibility and obtaining written informed consent ,  patients were stratified according to performance score and the presence and location of measurable disease .
The single doses of thymidine and 5-FU were repeated at 4-week intervals. 5-FUplus PALA. 5-FU was administered by rapid IV injection at a dosage of 300 mg/m2 for 5 consecutive days .
Courses of therapy were repeated every 5 weeks. 5-FU plus levamisole. 5-FU was administered in undiluted form by rapid IV injection at a dose of 500 mg/m 2/d for 5 consecutive days .
Levamisole was administered orally at a dose of 50 mg every 8 hours on days 14 ,  15. and 16 ,  and days 21. 22. and 23 of each 5- FU cycle .
For the 5-FU plus thymidine regimen ,  patients were evaluated every 4 weeks ,  while for all other regimens ,  this evaluation occurred every 5 weeks .
The evaluation consisted of a history and physical examination ,  measurement of indicator lesions. hematology and chemistry panel (including serum creatinine) ,  urinalysis ,  and a chest x-ray .
For the comparison of any one of our drug combinations with 5-FU. this would permit our test for treatment effect to have .90 probability of detecting a true doubling in survival time (eg. from 6 to 12 months). while having only a .05 probability of obtaining a false-positive result when there were no true differences in survival .
Standard criteria for declaring objective response were used. ie. a 5017 or greater reduction in the product of longest perpendicular diameters of bidimensionally measurable lesions or a 30% or greater decrease in the sum of liver measurements below the xyphoid process at costal margin .
Each combination regimen was compared to treatment with 5- FU alone with respect to duration of survival following randomization ,  time to disease progression. objective regression rates among measurable patients ,  and toxic reactions .
The log rank statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with equality of survival curves ,  while the Cox partial likelihood score statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with the hypothesis that any one of the combinations would yield at least a 50% improvement in survival over 5-FU alone .
MOF-Strept was characterized by substantially more frequent and more severe nausea and vomiting ,  and this was the only regimen characterized by a substantive incidence of thrombocytopenia. 5-FU plus PALA had substantially more frequent mucocutaneous reactions and somewhat more frequent diarrhea ,  but less hematologic toxicity than 5-FU alone or any of the other regimens .
It is noteworthy that while the MOF-Strept regimen had the highest regression rate ,  it was also the regimen with the lowest proportion of patients whose disease remained stable and the highest proportion of patients in whom the best response observed was tumor regression .
This factor was imbalanced among our treatment regimens ,  but this imbalance clearly weighed against the 5-FU arm that had the lowest proportion of low-grade lesions and the highest proportion of highly anaplastic tumors .
This was confirmed by a stratified Cox analysis ,  adjusting for key prognostic covariates ,  which indicated that the data were inconsistent with any combination regimen yielding a 50% increase in survival relative to 5-FU (ie ,  a hazard ratio of 1 .5) ,  wherefore 5-FU plus PALA ,  P < .01 ,  5-FU plus thymidine ,  P < .0001 ,  5-FU plus levamisole ,  P < .01 ,  and MOF-Strept ,  P < .05 .
In spite of the fact that the patients tested were in very good overall general condition with no previous chemotherapy exposure ,  none of our experimental regimens produced any meaningful advantage over therapy with simple 5-FU alone and none can be recommended for standard practice .
In designing the 5-FU-PALA regimen ,  we arbitrarily elected that both agents would be given at approximately equal proportions of the tolerable dose if each drug was used alone .
Martin has pointed out that it might be possible to obtain the full biochemical modulating effect of PALA by using a considerably lower dose of this agent ,  thereby allowing the 5-FU dose to be increased to near full therapeutic levels .
Unfortunately ,  this modulation did not translate into the therapeutic gain predicted by animal models ,  and the neurotoxicity only rarely observed with 5-FU alone was made much more prominent .
An interesting sidelight of this study is the fact that grade of tumor anaplasia was found to be a powerful prognostic determinant ,  matching the more well-established performance status and presence or absence of measurable disease .
The fact that all tissue was subjected to a common pathology review process may have produced sufficient uniformity of grading to allow this characteristic to be a useful predictor of survival .
