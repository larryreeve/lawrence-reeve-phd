DOXORUBICIN (DOX) ,  or Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories ,  Columbus ,  Ohio) ,  is one of the most useful antineoplastic agents available .
In retrospective studies ,  the incidence of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) was estimated to be approximately 3% to 4% after a cumulative DOX dose of 450 mg/m2 and 6% to 10% after 550 mg/m2 ,  the incidence of CHF rises steeply after higher cumulative doses.On the basis of these retrospective studies ,  an empiric dose limitation of 450 to 550 mg/m2 has been recommended when DOX is used on a standard every three week schedule .
One approach to solving this problem is the development of DOX analogues that retain antineoplastic activity but possess reduced potential for cardiac damage .
The antitumor activity of EPI in animal models is similar to that of DOX ,  but EPI is a less toxic compound with regard to both cytotoxicity and cardiac injury .
In the mouse ,  EPI and DOX have similar patterns of distribution to various tissues ,  although drug levels are lower in heart and spleen with EPI .
Other criteria for eligibility included a performance status of - 50% (Karnofsky scale) ,  a WBC count - 4,000/14L ,  a platelet count >- 100,000/L ,  normal serum bilirubin levels ( < 1.5 mg/dL) ,  and objectively evaluable or measurable disease .
Pretreatment Evaluation and Follow-up Studies Pretreatment evaluation of patients included complete history and physical examination ,  complete blood cell count (CBC) ,  12-channel biochemical profile ,  serum creatinine ,  chest roentgenogram ,  ECG ,  and bone scan .
Patients were stratified for performance status (Karnofsky scale < 70% v > 80%) and for estrogen receptor status of the primary or a metastatic lesion (positive or unknown v negative) .
Randomization was performed using the method of random permuted blocks ,  which assured an equal number of patients in each arm at specified time points .
Both EPI and DOX were administered by slow (five minute) injections through an established IV line every three weeks .
Evaluation of ResponseThe criteria for evaluation of therapeutic response were based on the recommendations of the Breast Cancer Task Force of the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda ,  Md).17 These guidelines were modified to include a minor response (MR) category for those patients with unequivocal therapeutic responses ,  but less than that required for a partial response (PR) .
Exercise was continued until the patient achieved the maximum predicted heart rate or until limited by fatigue ,  severe dyspnea ,  or chest pain .
Eight patients on the EPI arm and 14 on the DOX arm had received prior radiotherapy to the chest ,  mediastinum ,  or thoracic spine that may have exposed the myocardium to ionizing radiation .
In addition ,  four patients who received EPI and six who received DOX had a history of wellcontrolled systemic arterial hypertension .
Although the major response rates did not differ between the two arms (chisquare test ,  P = .98) ,  the difference in duration of response is of borderline significance (logrank test ,  P = .11) .
There was no difference (log rank test ,  P = .90) in the median time to progression between the patients on the EPI arm (3.9 months) and those on the DOX arm (5.1 months) .
The median WBC nadir was 2.0 x 103/gL (range ,  0.1 to 8.6) and the median platelet nadir was 132 x 103//pL (range ,  20.0 to 279.0) in patients receiving EPI ,  the median WBC nadir was 1.8 x 10'/3tL (range ,  0.3 to .9) and median platelet nadir was 130 x 103/pL (range 24.0 to 253.0) in patients on the DOX arm .
Of the 15 evaluable patients treated with EPI ,  six had received prior radiotherapy to the chest wall ,  internal mammary lymph nodes ,  sternum ,  or thoracic spine prior to entry on this study ,  and two had a history of well-controlled mild hypertension .
Of the 18 evaluable patients treated with DOX ,  seven had prior radiation exposure to the heart ,  two had hypertension ,  and two had both hypertension and prior radiotherapy .
Of the ten remaining patients on the EPI arm and elevenpatients on the DOX arm who are not evaluable for laboratory cardiac toxicity because they did not have a second RNCA study ,  the total cumulative doses of EPI and DOX were not significantly different ,  whether or not myelosuppressiveequivalent doses were taken into consideration .
One of the patients who developed CHF on the DOX arm is the patient who had the initial resting LVEF of 48% ,  this patient also had a history of pulmonary emboli and it was unclear whether this contributed to her cardiac decompensation .
Of the patients who developed symptomatic CHF on the EPI arm ,  one had prior radiotherapy and one had hypertension .
On the DOX arm ,  one of the patients who developed CHF had prior radiation exposure to the heart ,  one had hypertension ,  and one had prior radiotherapy as well as hypertension .
Thirteen percent of patients in another recent study developed CHF at a median dose of 405 mg/m 2 when DOX was given on an every three week schedule. 22 With optimal monitoring ,  one might be able to detect subclinical cardiac injury and prevent CHF by stopping the drug ,  this implies ,  however ,  the interruption of effective antineoplastic therapy .
Recently ,  liposomal encapsulation of DOX has been shown to decrease the cardiotoxicity of DOX in experimental animals ,  although it is unknown whether the drug's antineoplastic effects are preserved .
Two recent studies that used endomyocardial biopsy have demonstrated that a larger total cumulative dose of DOX can be tolerated if the drug is given weekly or by continuous intravenous infusion .
Structurally ,  EPI differsvery slightly from DOX and has the same molecular weight ,  yet EPI and DOX have different therapeutic ,  myelosuppressive ,  and  cardiotoxic potencies in animal systems .
A combination of RNCA and endomyocardial biopsy is recommended for the individual patient at high risk for whom a therapeutic decision must be made .
Although endomyocardial biopsy is probably the definitive measure of cardiac injury ,  RNCA has the advantage of being noninvasive and ,  therefore ,  acceptable to virtually all patients in a randomized study of antineoplastic agents .
Although these results could have been affected by the greater incidence of cardiac irradiation inpatients treated with DOX ,  only three patients who had received such radiotherapy actually developed CHF ,  one on the EPI arm and two on the DOX arm .
In the murine tumor model systems ,  equal doses of EPI and DOX produce equal therapeutic effects with less host toxicity in the EPI-treated mice ,  but a clinical assessment can only be based on studies in humans .
In the present study ,  each drug was given every three weeks in doses that produced equivalent degrees of myelosuppression ,  a preplanned limitation on the total cumulative dose of EPI was not used .
Brambilla and coworkers in Milan33 studied equal doses (75 mg/m2) of both drugs every three weeks ,  they limited the total cumulative dose of each drug to 600 mg/m2 .
A third study34 compared two multidrug combinations in which 5-fluorouracil (F) 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide (C) 500 mg/m2 were combined with an equal dosage (50 mg/m2) of either EPI (FEC [5-fluorouracil ,  EPI ,  cyclophosphamidel) or DOX (FAC) and administered every three weeks ,  the total dose of EPI was limited to 750 mg/m2 and of DOX to 550 mg/m2 .
Since the present study did not use a fixed limitation for dose of EPI ,  patients who did not have progression of tumor were treated to the point of laboratory cardiotoxicity or clinical CHF ,  therefore ,  this study provides cumulative cardiotoxicity data that are not available in the other two studies .
The other studies ,  which did use dose limits ,  provided data that could confirm the reliability of the survival analysis method we have used to assess the dose effect relationships with regard to RNCA changes .
Most patients in our trials received less than 550 mg/m2 of EPI ,  however ,  in 11 patients receiving cumulative EPI doses from 550 to 1,465 mg/m2 ,  RNCA abnormalities were observed in only four patients at 970 ,  1,180,1,190 ,  and 1,465 mg/m2 ,  respectively (C.W .
Our results show that EPI has therapeutic activity that is similar to that of DOX in patients with advanced breast cancer ,  and that EPI is a less cardiotoxic drug than DOX ,  even accounting for the difference in myelosuppressive potency .
In this study ,  worsening cardiac function forced the premature discontinuation of DOX therapy in three patients experiencing partial responses ,  whereas effective treatment with EPI was never discontinued because of cardiac toxicity .
ADDENDUMSince this manuscript was prepared for publication ,  an additional patient treated with DOX developed clinical congestive heart failure in the postoperative period following exploratory laparotomy .
