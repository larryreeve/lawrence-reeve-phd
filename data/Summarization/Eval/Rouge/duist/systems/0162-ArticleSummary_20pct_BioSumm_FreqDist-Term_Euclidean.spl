SINCE JUNE 1973 ,  the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of CMF (cyclophosphamide ,  methotrexate ,  and fluorouracil) chemotherapy were evaluated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes .
Among the numerous questions to be answered by current adjuvant studies is the optimal duration of treatment .
Similar findings were reported in the 4-yr analysis for the total patient population .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
The technique of block randomization (permuted block of length 4 for 2 regimens) was utilized .
Adjuvant chemotherapy was started within 2-4 wk from mastectomy .
All radiographs were repeatedly reviewed by a team of radiologists to confirm the presence and exact timing of recurrence .
Patient Population .
Study Parameters .
Liver scan and mammography of residual breast were done once a year .
In the presence of controversial radiologic findings ,  examinations were performed more often than originally planned .
In the present series ,  baseline and routine bone scans were systematically performed in about half of patients .
Statistical Evaluation .
Probabilities represent comparison of the entire plots ,  computed by use of the productlimit method ,  and were calculated using the log-rank test and values of significance .
RESULTS .
In postmenopausal women with more than 3 nodes ,  the difference between CMF 12 (34.4%) and CMF 6 (54.9% ,  p = 0.18) is only apparent since the confidence-limits throughout the curve totally blurred the percent difference (standard error ,  or SE ,  at 5 yr ,  8.4 and 11.3 ,  respectively) .
Figure 2 shows the 5-yr total survival .
The same held true when findings were related to menopausal status .
Site of First Relapse .
At present ,  this difference is somewhat difficult to explain .
Early and Late Toxicity .
Acute toxic reactions have been previously reported .
Nausea ,  vomiting ,  and hair loss were the most distressing side effects .
So far no patient has developed acute leukemia .
DISCUSSION .
In fact ,  confidence limits of the various series totally blurred the difference throughout the curves .
A long-term analysis would probably clarify this aspect .
One of them is the dose level of CMF ,  the importance of  which has been extensively evaluated in a recent publication .
Other considerations of practical importance can also be derived from our current findings .
Effective adjuvant combination chemotherapy seems to be unaffected by ER status ,  at least when RFS is considered .
At present ,  we have no clear explanation for this difference .
This is an extremely important clinical observation .
Moreover ,  a less protracted exposure to cytotoxic regimens ,  including alkylating agents and adriamycin ,  could decrease the potential risk of delayed morbidity ,  namely cancerogenesis and chronic organ damage .
Briefly ,  all classes of drugs select and allow overgrowth of specifically drug-resistant neoplastic cells .
Eventually ,  and regardless of prolonged chemotherapy ,  the resistant neoplastic cells overgrow ,  become clinically evident ,  and kill the host .
