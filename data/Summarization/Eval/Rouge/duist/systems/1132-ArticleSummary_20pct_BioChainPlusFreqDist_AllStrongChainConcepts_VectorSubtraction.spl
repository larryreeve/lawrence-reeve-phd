ALTHOUGH much progress has been made in the early detection and control of carcinoma of the cervix since the introduction of  the Papanicolau test ,  it is estimated that about 13,500 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 1990 in  the United States with 6,000 patients dying from the disease .
Here we report the results of this study .
Fifty-two patients were randomized to the CT + RT arm and 55 to the RT arm .
Treatment Regimens .
A dose of 40 Gy was routinely prescribed to point A ,  which was located 2 cm superior  to the cervical os (applicator flange) and 2 cm lateral to the central axis of the uterus .
This RT regimen was used for both  groups .
The third bleomycin cycle was either withheld or the bleomycin dose was  reduced in 15% of the patients ,  mainly because of severe skin hyperpigmentation .
Following completion of irradiation ,  patients were  assessed every 2 to 3 months for the first 2 years and every 6 months thereafter .
Toxicity of CT was assessed before each course .
Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method21 and was measured from day 1 of therapy until last  follow-up or death .
Actuarial survival curves were compared by the log-rank method .
RESULTS .
No patient was lost to follow-up .
The median follow-up time for the RT arm is 51 months (range ,  34 to 67) and is 44 months  (range ,  35 to 65) for the CT + RT .
In Table 4 ,  we show the number of patients still alive in spite of their disease being classified as PR  at the end of treatment .
The overall 5-year actuarial  survival for the two groups is shown in Fig 1 .
Median survivals were 25 months in the RT arm and 10.5 months in the CT + RT .
The 5-year  survival rates for the complete responders were 57% and 36% for the RT and CT + RT groups ,  respectively .
There was also no  difference in the incidence of distant disease between RT and CT + RT (20% v18.5%) .
Toxicity .
After two bleomycin-related lung deaths (two of nine treated patients) ,  the  bleomycin dose was reduced from 30 U daily for 4 days to 30 U daily for 3 days .
A more detailed  description of the pulmonary toxicity has been the subject of another report.' .
Diarrhea was the main complication of pelvic  irradiation ,  seen in eight patients (15.5%) on RT and 11 (34%) on CT + RT .
DISCUSSION .
All responding  patients experienced major symptomatic improvement .
Although 25.5% of the patients achieved a CR following three cycles of BOMP and 47% of the CT + RT group obtained a CR at the  end of RT ,  the 5-year overall survival was significantly inferior in the CT + RT group than in the control arm (39% v 21% ,  P  = .02) .
The reason for this surprising and disturbing finding is not entirely clear .
This may explain why in spite of a satisfactory rate of response following neoadjuvant CT ,  there was no  improvement in local tumor control ,  and survival was adversely affected .
Thus ,  a PR or even a CR could therefore  be of questionable value in determining therapeutic effectiveness ,  as tumor masses would be still regressing while the  subclinical clonogenic cell repopulation is accelerating .
In this study ,  27% of the patients (14 of 52) in  the RT group were called partial responders at the end of irradiation .
In this study ,  the incidence of pulmonary  toxicity was 13% (five of 39) ,  with four patients dying from this complication .
As in our study ,  they could not correlate the incidence of lung toxicity with any of the standard risk factors .
At present ,  there is no evidence to support the use of upfront CT before pelvic irradiation in stage III B cervical cancer .
