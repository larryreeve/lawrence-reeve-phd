Fluorouracil can be used as first-line or second-line therapy and a different regimen of fluorouracil can be administered as second-line treatment if first-line treatment fails .
The drug has no cross-resistance with fluorouracil and functions via a novel molecular mechanism .
Phase III studies of patients whose disease had not responded to first-line fluorouracil ,  or patients whose disease had progressed after first-line fluorouracil treatment ,  showed increased survival times in patients given irinotecan compared with those receiving best supportive care or high-dose fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone by continuous infusion .
Phase I dose-escalation studies were done to test combined irinotecan with fluorouracil and calcium folinate weekly or every 2 weeks .
The choice of regimen was left to investigators ,  according to local clinical practice ,  since the two regimens are widely used in Europe .
We obtained written informed consent from each patient before enrolment .
Randomisation was done centrally in the study sponsor's office by a computer-generated random scheme ,  and was stratified by centre .
Irinotecan was administered according to the guidelines used for irinotecan monotherapy ,  including recommendations for the use of concurrent antiemetics ,  atropine ,  and loperamide .
The duration of response was the time from first infusion to progression in responding patients .
The time to treatment failure was the time from randomisation to treatment discontinuation or progression of disease ,  whichever came first .
Responses were assessed after each treatment cycle ,  according to WHO criteria .
We used the validated QLQC30 questionnaire of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer .
Patients completed questionnaires before each cycle (every 6.7 weeks) .
We did log-rank tests stratified by this variable .
We tested the nine following variables ,  sex ,  WHO performance status (<2 and <=2) ,  weight loss (<=5% and >5%) ,  number of organs involved (<3 and <=3) ,  primary tumour site (colon or rectum) ,  organ involvement (liver only or other sites) ,  time from first diagnosis to first metastasis (0.3 ,  >3-12 ,  >12 months) ,  previous surgery ,  and previous adjuvant therapy .
Patients and treatment .
Two patients received no study treatment because consent was withdrawn .
A higher proportion of women were assigned fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone than the irinotecan regimen ,  and the rectum was the primary tumour site in a higher proportion of patients in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group .
In the evaluable population ,  the response rate was 49% in the irinotecan group ,  compared with 31% in the noirinotecan group (p<0.001) .
The effect of treatment was significant (p<0.001) ,  the Survival in the irinotecan group was significantly longer hazard ratio for response was 2.6 times higher in the than in the no-irinotecan group (median 17.4 [0.4-28.4+] irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group ,  given the same degree of weight loss at baseline and the same time between first diagnosis and first metastasis .
In Cox’s multivariate analysis of time to progression (table 4) ,  age and number of organs involved were significantly predictive .
The vs 14.1 [0.5-27.6+] months ,  p=0.031 ,  figure 3) .
The probability of survival in the irinotecan group was 82.1% at 9 months and 69.1% at 12 months ,  and in the noirinotecan group was 71.6% and 59.1% ,  respectively .
This adverse effect occurred more frequently with the weekly than with the corresponding 2-weekly regimen in the two treatment groups .
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and leukopenia were significantly more frequent in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group ,  irrespective of regimen .
In the irinotecan group ,  admission was required for fever in the absence of infection with concomitant grade 3 or 4 neutropenia for five (9.3%) patients on the weekly regimen and one (0.7%) on the 2-weekly regimen ,  for the no-irinotecan group ,  admission was required for one (2.3%) patient on the weekly regimen and none on the 2 weekly regimen .
Doses were reduced because of toxic effects more frequently for the weekly regimen than for the 2-weekly regimen ,  and more in the irinotecan than in the noirinotecan group .
Discussion .
In two phase-III studies ,  for oxaliplatin in combination with infusional fluorouracil and calcium folinate ,  the response rate and progression-free survival were better than with fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone .
Those studies did not ,  however ,  show survival benefits .
The results we achieved with the irinotecan combination treatment show that the addition of irinotecan to weekly or 2-weekly regimens of fluorouracil and calcium folinate by infusion brings clear clinical benefit and should be considered as a first-line reference treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer as well as for advanced disease .
