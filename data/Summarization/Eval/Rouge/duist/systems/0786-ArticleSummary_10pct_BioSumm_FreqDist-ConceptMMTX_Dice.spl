In 1985 ,  the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG ,  study GI 7175) reported that postoperative radiation and chemotherapy reduced the tumor recurrence rate for patients who had undergone a curative resection for rectal adenocarcinoma .
Although the superiority of combination radiotherapy and chemotherapy with fluorouracil(5-FU) and semustine (MeCCNU) was clearly shown in terms of both disease-free survival and ,  subsequently , overall survival ,  the clinical impact of such treatment was tempered by the inclusion of MeCCNU in an adjuvant setting .
Patients must have recovered from the acute effects of surgery ,  been capable of starting treatment within 60 days after resection ,  had no evidence of active infection ,  had adequate performance and nutritional status to tolerate protocol treatment ,  and had no preexisting or concurrent malignant tumors except basal cell or superficial squamous cell carcinomas of the skin .
Presence of ascites ,  peritoneal seeding ,  residual pelvic tumor ,  positive paraaortic lymph node biopsy ,  or distant metastases excluded patients from study ,  as did previous chemotherapy or pelvic irradiation or any active and significant coexistent disease that ,  in the judgment of the investigator ,  would make the risks of chemotherapy or radiation therapy prohibitive .
Normal hepatic ,  renal ,  and bone marrow function (ie ,  bilirubin level < 2.5 mg/dL ,  BUN level< 25 mg/dL ,  or creatinine level < 1.5 mg/dL ,  leukocyte and platelet counts > 4,500/uL and 125,000/uL ,  respectively) must have been documented before study entry .
The inferior margin included the perineumin all patients who underwent an abdominal-perineal resection and whose tumor was <= 5 cm from the dentate line .
During postradiotherapy chemotherapy ,  moderate or severe nausea or vomiting required a 50% dose reduction of all chemotherapy for one course ,  mild stomatitis or diarrhea ,  continued but not escalated therapy ,  and moderate or worse stomatitis ,  reduction of the next course of chemotherapy by 25% .
Central review of radiotherapy treatment records including contour and isodose curves ,  dosimetry calculations ,  simulation films ,  verification films for each port displaying treatment fields ,  and dose prescription was conducted by Dr P.R.M .
Disease recurrence required histologic or cytologic documentation with the exception that radiographic techniques could be used to establish the presence of metastases to the lung ,  liver ,  bony structures ,  or brain .
Reasons for ineligibility were as follows ,  colon cancer rather than rectal cancer (five patients) ,  prior history of cancer (two) ,  and incomplete resection (four) .
Selected patient characteristics show that 58% had disease extension involving the perirectal fat with at least one positive lymph node ,  60% of patients are male ,  and 59% underwent an abdominal-perineal resection (Table 1) .
As planned in the protocol design ,  patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm were treated for a longer duration than patients who received escalating 5-FU (median ,  11.3 months v 7.5 months ,  respectively) .
Although patients received a median total dose of 12.4 g/m of 5-FU on the escalating 5-FU arm (25% < the planned level of 16.5g/m) and 13.1 g/m of 5-FU on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm (23% < the planned level of 16.9 g/m) ,  the median monthly dose of 5-FU on the escalating arm was 1.74g/m ,  compared with 1.40 g/m on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm (P < .001) .
Leukocyte depression below 1,000/UL accounted for a majority of these episodes (eight patients on the escalating 5-FU arm and three on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm) .
The prognostic importance of Dukes stage ,  resection type ,  distance to the nearest margin ,  age ,  sex ,  and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score on disease-free survival was examined in the cohort of eligible patients .
Figure 3 compares the survival prognosis of patients undergoing abdominal-perineal resections and patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to margin of resection (as determined by the pathologist on fresh specimen) of <= 3 cm and greater than 3 cm. Patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to the margin greater than 3 cm experienced improved survival compared with patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to the nearest margin <= 3 cm ,  suggesting that abdominal-perineal resection should be considered when the distal margin for resection with the low anterior route would be <= 3 cm .
The results of the present study confirm the expected survival and disease-free survival probabilities observed in the combination therapy arm of the previous GITSG study ,  while the recent report by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) further demonstrates the advantage of combination radiation therapy and chemotherapy compared with radiation therapy alone in reducing recurrence rates and improving survival .
Although data from the initial rectal cancer adjuvant trial conducted by the National Surgical Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP RO1) suggested improved survival and disease-free survival in patients treated with chemotherapy alone compared with surgery alone ,  that study did not include a combined modality treatment arm .
A recent National Institutes of Health consensus conference on adjuvant therapy for patients with colon and rectal cancer concluded that combined postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy improved local control and survival in stage B2 and C patients with rectal cancer and that treatment with combined modality therapy in these patients is recommended .
