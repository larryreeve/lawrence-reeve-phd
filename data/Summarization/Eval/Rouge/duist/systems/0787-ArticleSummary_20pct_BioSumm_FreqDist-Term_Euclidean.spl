Introduction .
Rectal cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases with 11 500 cases diagnosed in the UK in 1994 alone .
Little change has been seen in survival rates ,  which remain at about 40% at 5 years from diagnosis .
The aim was to increase the number of patients in whom curative resection could be done ,  and so improve survival rates .
We gained local ethics committee approval for the study and consent from the participants .
Two parallel opposed fields 18 cm by 15 cm were positioned to cover the tumour with an adequate proximal margin (normally 5 cm). 20 daily fractions of 2 Gy at the mid-plane central axis of the volume of the tumour were given over 4 weeks .
Biopsy samples were taken whenever possible ,  and pelvic radiography was done to look for evidence of bone destruction .
Event-free times were recorded from the date of randomisation .
Statistical analysis .
Proportions were compared by the  2 test ,  and ordered categorical data by the Mann-Whitney test .
Survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method ,  and compared by the Mantel-Cox version of the log-rank test .
All analyses were carried out by intention to treat .
Results .
Of the 279 patients ,  217 died .
Surgeons were also asked to report any other complications .
However ,  the number of lymph nodes examined was lower in the radiotherapy group .
At follow-up ,  surgeons were asked to report on the status of the patients' abdominal and (if applicable) perineal wounds ,  and to describe ,  in broad terms ,  any late complications .
Necropsy was done rarely and so causes of death should be interpreted with caution .
However ,  cause-specific survival analysis suggests a larger benefit for radiotherapy .
Discussion .
However ,  the trial was of sufficient size to detect only substantial improvement in overall survival .
This reluctance may have hindered recruitment to the trial .
In addition ,  the patients selected for this study represent only a small proportion of total operable cases .
None of these studies has concentrated specifically on locally advanced tumours .
