ALTHOUGH much progress has been made in the early detection and control of carcinoma of the cervix since the introduction of  the Papanicolau test ,  it is estimated that about 13,500 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 1990 in  the United States with 6,000 patients dying from the disease .
The role of chemotherapy (CT) ,  either as a single agent or in  combination ,  has been extensively evaluated in advanced or recurrent disease .
The use of upfront CT as  initial treatment before pelvic RT would be theoretically advantageous as the vascular supply to the tumor is not  compromised ,  allowing a higher local tissue concentration of drugs ,  thereby improving the effectiveness of CT .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Eligibility criteria consisted of a histopathologic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma ,  age younger than 70  years with no past history of malignancy ,  the lower third of the vagina free of disease ,  and a performance status greater  than 50% in the Karnofsky scale .
No patient underwent lymph node biopsy to confirm the radiologic  findings .
A tumor dose of 50 Gy ,  in 2 Gy daily fractions ,  5 days per week ,   was prescribed at midplane .
Both fields were treated on each day of treatment .
Hydration consistedof 1L of normal  saline infused IV over 3 hours before cisplatin administration .
Following completion of irradiation ,  patients were  assessed every 2 to 3 months for the first 2 years and every 6 months thereafter .
Disease status was evaluated by pelvic  examination and by appropriate radiologic and laboratory investigations .
Only supportive palliative treatment was given to relapsing patients ,  and CT was  not used as a salvage treatment for the patients in the RT-only arm .
We planned to accrue 60 patients into each treatment arm ,  which would produce a power of 80%  and detect an improvement of 25 % in survival with the combined modality treatment at the a = 0.05 level (two-sided test) .
Actuarial survival curves were compared by the log-rank method .
The CR  rate after three cycles of BOMP CT was 25.5% .
For the partial responders ,  57% in the RT arm and 37.5% in the CT + RT are alive with no evidence of  disease progression at a minimum follow-up time of 3 years .
The 5-year  survival rates for the complete responders were 57% and 36% for the RT and CT + RT groups ,  respectively .
Pelvic disease remains the major site of failure ,  with at least 50% of the patients failing within  the irradiated volume .
At this time ,  an interim analysis that  was performed disclosed a survival advantage for the RT group ,  and it was then decided to close the study .
A more detailed  description of the pulmonary toxicity has been the subject of another report.' .
This patient developed a fulminant septicemia ,  and despite  intensive surgical and medical treatments died soon after admission to the hospital .
This study was designed with the objective of answering the question of whether neoadjuvant BOMP chemotherapy is effective in  stage III B carcinoma of the cervix .
All responding  patients experienced major symptomatic improvement .
These reasons together with the  initial promising results with BOMP prompted us to start our randomized study .
The reason for this surprising and disturbing finding is not entirely clear .
Some randomized studies have ,  in  fact ,  showed worse survival with the use of neoadjuvant CT .
The mechanisms by which this increased cell proliferation occurs  are not entirely clear ,  although ,  as suggested by Tannock , 34 it may result from improved nutrition of surviving cells  following shrinkage of the tumor due to previous therapy .
Another possible explanatory mechanism for our poorer results with the combined treatment modality may be the development of  cross resistance between radiation and certain antineoplastic agents .
It is a subjective evaluation that frequently depends on the ability of the investigator to differentiate  between residual local disease or treatment-induced parametrial fibrosis .
Of these ,  57% remain alive with no evidence of disease  progression .
In fact ,  this approach might be detrimental ,  as demonstrated in the present study .
The high toxicity rate of BOMP CT ,  in the  dose and schedule used in this study ,  makes this combination unacceptable for routine use .
The  effectiveness of this approach will be evaluated in the near future by a prospective and randomized phase III trial sponsored  by the National Cancer Institute of Canada .
