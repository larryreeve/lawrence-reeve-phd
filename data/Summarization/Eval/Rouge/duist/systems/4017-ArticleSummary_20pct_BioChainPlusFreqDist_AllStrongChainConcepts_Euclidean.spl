Methods .
Our primary endpoint was response rate .
Time to progression was the time from randomisation to progression .
The duration of response was the time from first infusion to progression in responding patients .
The time to treatment failure was the time from randomisation to treatment discontinuation or progression of disease ,  whichever came first .
We used the validated QLQC30 questionnaire of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer .
The questionnaire includes five scales for functioning ,  one scale for global health status ,  and nine symptom scales .
For analysis by two-tailed log-rank test (a=0.05 ,  power of 0.80) ,  with the assumption that accrual and minimum follow-up would last for 6 months and 9 months ,  respectively ,  we had to include 143 patients in each treatment group .
For continuous variables ,  we used Student's t tests .
We did log-rank tests stratified by this variable .
A logistic-regression model was used to identify the prognostic factors for response .
The time to definitive deterioration from baseline by 5% ,  10% ,  20% ,  and 30% was analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method .
In the evaluable population ,  the response rate was 49% in the irinotecan group ,  compared with 31% in the noirinotecan group (p<0.001) .
The median duration of response was 9.3 (2.8-13.1) months in the irinotecan group and 8.8 (3.7-11.8) months in the no-irinotecan group (p=0.08) .
Duration of response and stabilisation was longer in the irinotecan group (8.6 [1.6-13.6] vs 6.2 [1.1-11.8] months ,  p<0.001) .
Time to progression was longer in the irinotecan than in the noirinotecan group (median 6.7 [0+.13.8+] vs 4.4 group and the no-irinotecan group ,  33.1% (95% CI 25.5-41.4) and 21.0% (14.6-28.6 ,  p=0.021) ,  median time to progression was 6.5 (range 0+.13.2) months and 3.7 (0+.13.1+) months (p=0.001) ,  and median survival was 17.4 (0.4-28.3+) months and 13.0 (0.5-27.6+) months .
The log-rank test was significant (p=0.0098) .
The log-rank test stratified by regimen and that stratified by country were significant (each p<0.001) .
Median followirinotecan group was 69.8% and 54.8% ,  respectively .
In the stepwise multivariate logistic regression (table 3) ,  weight loss of 5% or less at baseline and time between first diagnosis and first metastasis were predictive of response. up was 23.3 (20.0-29.7) months .
In Cox’s multivariate analysis of time to progression (table 4) ,  age and number of organs involved were significantly predictive .
The vs 14.1 [0.5-27.6+] months ,  p=0.031 ,  figure 3) .
The log-rank test stratified by regimen was significant (p=0.03) ,  as was that stratified by country (p=0.04) .
The median time to treatment failure was 5.3 (0.4-15.7+) months in the irinotecan group and 3.8 (0.4-11.5+) months in the no-irinotecan group (p=0.0014) .
1161 questionnaires were obtained from the 385 patients in the intention-to-treat population .
The same trend was seen with the second imputation method .
Definitive deterioration in quality of life occurred consistently later in the irinotecan group ,  for a deterioration from baseline by 5% (p=0.03) ,  10% (p=0.06) ,  20% (p=0.04) ,  and 30% (p=0.06) .
The higher frequency of adverse events in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan did not affect the median duration of treatment .
In two phase-III studies ,  for oxaliplatin in combination with infusional fluorouracil and calcium folinate ,  the response rate and progression-free survival were better than with fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone .
Moreover ,  there was a trend towards shorter survival in the oxaliplatin group in one study .
Another phase III study that compared irinotecan combined with bolus fluorouracil and fluorouracil alone consistently provided significantly higher response rates (33 vs 18% ,  p<0.001) and median time to treatment failure (5.0 vs 3.8 months ,  p<0.05) in the irinotecan group .
