INTRODUCTION .
Radical external beam plus intracavitary radiation continues to be the standard therapy for advanced cervical cancer to which all new therapies must be compared .
While this treatment is relatively effective in small volume tumors ,  tumor control and survival decline as the bulk of pelvic disease and FIGO stage advance .
Overall 5-year survival rates are reported for stage IIB cancers between 50 and 80% and from 25 to 50% for stage III .
No substantial improvements have beenmade in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer in the past two decades .
An analysis of the patterns of failure after radiation therapy in locally advanced cervical cancer reveals that of those who recur over 70% have some component of pelvic failure as the first site of relapse and two-thirds develop some component of distant disease .
As the bulk of pelvic diseaseincreases ,  the proportion of patients with disease recurrent or persistent in the pelvis as the only site of failure increases compared to the proportion developing distant metastases .
The problem of enhancing pelvic control and survival cannot be approached simply by increasing conventionally delivered radiation dose since late complications produced by radiation are at the upper limit of acceptability with currently employed doses .
Many investigations are ongoing to identify more effective treatment .
These include modifications of radiation treatment volume or fractionation including extended field radiation ,  hyperfractionated RT ,  strategies to overcome the negative impact of tumor hypoxia such as hyperbaric oxygen ,  or hypoxic cell radiation sensitizers .
The results reported for trials of neoadjuvant cisplatin-containing chemotherapy prior to radiation have been disappointing with six randomized trials ,  showing no advantage in local control or survival and possibly some detrimental effect .
Concurrent chemotherapy with radiation offers a number of theoretical advantages over those of the neoadjuvant strategy .
Chemotherapy may also ,  as in the neoadjuvant strategy ,  have an independent ,  additive cytotoxic effect .
Last ,  it is unlikely that concurrent chemotherapy usually given as only one or two doses would significantly reduce established distant micrometastases .
Patients were randomized to receive either (a) standard external beam pelvic irradiation (EBRT) in a dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions defined at 100% versus ,  (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional intravenous 5-FU in a dose of 1 g/m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  (c) partially hyperfractionated RT ,  5280 cGy in 33 fractions ,  2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  or (d) arm (c) with the same infusional 5-FU .
Where possible ,  chemotherapy infusion was given on four consecutive days without a weekend break .
The outcomes of interest in this study were pelvic control ,  survival ,  and disease-free survival ,  as well as the serious late complication rate .
If differences were to be observed in pelvic control and survival in arm (d) versus arm (a) ,  this could be due to a change in either or both factors .
Assuming that the magnitude and direction of the 5-FU effects were similar in arms (b) and (d) then the effect of the addition of 5-FU could be tested by comparing arms (b) and (d) with arms (a) and (c) .
The effect of the fractionation was to be tested by comparing arms (c) and (d) with arms (a) and (b) (Fig. 1) .
In order to detect a 20% improvement in pelvic control rate from an expected 50% for arm (a) to 70% for arm (d) assuming an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.20 ,  73 patients in each of four treatment arms would be required for a total of 292 patients .
In order to detect an improvement of 15% in survival in arms (c) and (d) compared to that seen in arms (a) and (b) ,  assuming a 40% cause-specific survival rate in arm (a) and an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.2 ,  the total number of patients required was 272 .
The ‘‘Lifetest Procedure’’ in SAS UNIX was used to compare survival curves .
Cox’s proportional hazards model was used to examine the variables which might contribute to pelvic control or survival within stratum 1 .
In the standard radiation plus 5-FU arm (b) ,  52 of the 53 patients received the standard dose prescription .
Of the 23 patients who received no intracavitary radiation or doses less than 500 cGy ,  there was a relatively even distribution across the treatment arms with 5 in arm (a) ,  5 in arm (b) ,  3 in arm (c) ,  and 9 in arm (d) .
Of the patients randomized to receive standard radiation with 5-FU ,  four received no chemotherapy and three received less than 1 g/m2 with each course .
In patients randomized to receive hyperfractionated irradiation and 5-FU ,  three received no chemotherapy and three received less than 1 g/m2 with each course .
Pelvic Control and Survival .
The disease free 5-year survival in arm (a) ,  (c) ,  (d) ,  and (b) ,  respectively , were 45 ,  53 ,  58 ,  and 61% .
The overall pelvic control by treatment assigned for arms (a) ,  (c) ,  (d) ,  and (b) was 58 ,  65 ,  68 ,  and 69% ,  respectively .
There was a significant improvement in 5-year survival and disease-free survival for those treated with standard radiation and 5-FU compared to the other treatments (log rank test P 5 0.05) .
The 5-year Kaplan–Meier survival was 62% for those treated with hyperfractionated irradiation and was not significantly different from the 58% survival of those treated with standard irradiation .
The observed differences in pelvic control and survival in favor of the standard radiation and concurrent 5-FU associated with the addition of 5-FU rather than the change in radiation schedule .
Stratum 2 was examined for differences in pelvic control and survival between the treatment arms and no significant differences were observed .
Since significant differences in pelvic control and survival were observed in stratum 1 which contained only 99 patients ,  it is important to examine whether there was an uneven distribution of other possible patient or tumor-related prognostic factors across the treatment arms to account for the differences observed .
To reach the conclusion that concurrent chemotherapy truly adds benefit to results achievable with radiation alone ,  it is important that the radiation be delivered in an optimal manner with adequate doses at ‘‘Point A’’ (80 to 90 Gy) and limited overall treatment times .
Patients were stratified into three groups in this study because pelvic control and survival outcomes are strongly influenced by the bulk of pelvic disease ,  declining with increasing bulk .
The original design for this study required 292 patients with adequate power to detect a 15% difference in pelvic control and survival .
Within stratum 2 there was an improvement in pelvic control with the use of 5-FU but the difference was not statistically significant .
However ,  in stratum 1 constituted of patients with stage IB/IIA and those IIB tumors with medial parametrial involvement ,  a significant improvement in both pelvic control and disease-free survival in favor of standard radiation with concurrent 5-FU was observed (Figs. 5 and 6) .
The lack of significant benefit for 5-FU in stratum 2 may be due to the small sample size or ,  theoretically ,  that the added chemotherapy was insufficient to significantly impact on more advanced disease .
