Introduction .
Rectal cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases with 11 500 cases diagnosed in the UK in 1994 alone .
Little change has been seen in survival rates ,  which remain at about 40% at 5 years from diagnosis .
In an attempt to increase the rate of curative resection and hence survival ,  several trials have investigated the role of preoperative radiotherapy in treatment of rectal cancer .
The first UK Medical Research Council (MRC) trial of preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer was a three-arm randomised trial with 824 patients comparing a control (surgery alone) group with a group treated with 20 Gy given in 10 equal fractions and another treated with a single exposure of 5 Gy .
These doses of radiation were chosen after trials by the Veterans Administration Surgical Adjuvant Group and the Princess Margaret Hospital ,  Toronto ,  suggested survival advantage with radiotherapy for patients with tumours of Dukes stage C .
Despite the suggestion of a real biological effect of the radiotherapy in the first MRC trial ,  with significant changes in tumour stage ,  no advantage was found for either radiotherapy group over the control group in terms of disease recurrence or survival .
However ,  the trial did demonstrate the importance of fixity as a prognostic factor. 80% of mobile tumours had apparently curative resections compared with 50% of partially fixed ,  and 30% of fixed tumours .
The importance of fixity was reflected in the survival pattern ,  5-year survival for fixed or partially fixed tumours was just 29% compared with 48% for mobile tumours .
In 1981 ,  the MRC began this trial of a higher dose of preoperative radiotherapy in patients with fixed or partially fixed tumours of the rectum who were thought to be suitable for abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection .
The aim was to increase the number of patients in whom curative resection could be done ,  and so improve survival rates .
The dose of radiation (40 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks) was chosen as the highest that was deemed safe before anterior resection with the wide-field technique proposed .
We present the results of this trial with a minimum follow-up time for surviving patients of 5 years .
Patients and methods .
Eligible patients were men or women younger than 80 years who ,  had histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum partially or totally fixed within the pelvis with the lower margin of the tumour within 15 cm of the anal verge ,  were deemed suitable and fit for the proposed treatment and available for regular follow-up ,  were free of disseminated disease (confirmed by clinical and radiological examination) ,  and had had no previous malignant disease .
We gained local ethics committee approval for the study and consent from the participants .
When an eligible patient was enrolled ,  the randomised treatment allocation was obtained by means of a telephone call to the MRC Cancer Trials Office in Cambridge .
Eligibility was confirmed and treatment allocated by minimisation on three factors ,  treatment centre ,  extension of tumour (fixed or partially fixed) ,  and intended operation (abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection) .
Patients then proceeded to immediate surgery or to radiotherapy followed by surgery after a minimum of 4 weeks .
Megavoltage radiotherapy was started as soon as possible after randomisation .
Two parallel opposed fields 18 cm by 15 cm were positioned to cover the tumour with an adequate proximal margin (normally 5 cm). 20 daily fractions of 2 Gy at the mid-plane central axis of the volume of the tumour were given over 4 weeks .
Patients were seen every 3 months for 1 year ,  then every 6 months for 4 years .
Patients who completed 5 years follow-up and those who were lost to follow-up were flagged on the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) register so that we would be notified of date and cause of death .
At each visit ,  the status of the abdominal and perineal wounds was assessed ,  late complications of treatment recorded ,  and evidence of local or distant recurrence noted .
