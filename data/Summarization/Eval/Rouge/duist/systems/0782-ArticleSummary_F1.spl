At a median follow up of 8 years the use of adjuvant intraportal chemotherapy significantly reduced the risks of recurrence and death following apparently curtaive resection of colorectal cancer .
These differences were greatest for node postive patients and for those with colonic primary lesions but were maintained across all subgroups .
The difference was due to a reduction in local as well as hepatic and distant treatment failures so that at least part of the efficacy seems to have been due to sytemics well as intrahepatic effects .
