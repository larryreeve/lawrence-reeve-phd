Preoperative and postoperative radiation therapy alone ,  while reducing the local recurrence rate ,  has not been shown to improve survival .
Treatment was limited to patients with tumors penetrating the full thickness of the rectal wall or with metastasis to regional lymph nodes .
The leukemogenic effect of MeCCNU was established subsequent to the initiation of GI 7175 ,  indeed ,  one patient who participated in GI 7175 developed acute myeloid leukemia after MeCCNU therapy .
Patients must have recovered from the acute effects of surgery ,  been capable of starting treatment within 60 days after resection ,  had no evidence of active infection ,  had adequate performance and nutritional status to tolerate protocol treatment ,  and had no preexisting or concurrent malignant tumors except basal cell or superficial squamous cell carcinomas of the skin .
The treatment volume as defined must have received 4,140 cGy at a rate of 180 cGy/d ,  five treatments per week .
After this 5-week period ,  patients received one of the two chemotherapy schedules .
One dose of MeCCNU 100 mg/m was to be given orally on day 1 .
One year after study activation ,  treatment duration was decreased to a total of 12 months of treatment due to concerns about the leukemic potential of MeCCNU .
During postradiotherapy chemotherapy ,  moderate or severe nausea or vomiting required a 50% dose reduction of all chemotherapy for one course ,  mild stomatitis or diarrhea ,  continued but not escalated therapy ,  and moderate or worse stomatitis ,  reduction of the next course of chemotherapy by 25% .
Dose reductions of 5-FU by 25% were required for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU treatment arm who experienced a leukocyte count nadir of below 2,000/UL during the first 3 weeks .
Treatment with 5-FU was to be continued at 5-week intervals .
The original design called for the enrollment of 134 patients per arm ,  and the primary end point was to detect a difference in the 30-month disease-free survival rate from .65 for the MeCCNU-containing arm to .80 for the escalating 5-FU arm .
Given the leukemic potential of MeCCNU ,  it is important to find a treatment that is at least as effective as a treatment containing MeCCNU .
Using the techniques of Makuch and Simon ,  it can be shown that a sample size of 100 patients per arm has an 80% power to exclude differences in treatments as great as .19 assuming a = .05 and a 30-month rate of .65 .
The contribution of variables and treatment effect was tested using the proportional hazards procedures of Cox and the log-rank test .
The remaining 199 patients (95% of the registered population) are included for survival analysis in the study group to which they were randomized regardless of whether or not protocol treatment was administered .
Four patients received no protocol treatment and are excluded from the toxicity analyses but are included in the survival and disease-free survival analyses .
Although the protocol required treatment to begin within 60 days of surgery ,  20 patients evenly distributed between the two treatment arms began treatment more than 60 days postsurgery ,  16 of the 20 individuals received their initial therapy within 64 days .
Treatment Administration .
Two treatment-related deaths were reported ,  one on each treatment arm .
One event occurred in a 50-year old man assigned to receive escalating 5-FU .
Six patients are reported to have experienced severe (three) or life-threatening (three) treatment-related intestinal obstructions ,  two receiving the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen and four on escalating 5-FU (Table 2) .
One patient developed intestinal obstruction during the radiation therapy .
The difference in disease-free survival favors the escalating 5-FU arm ,  but this difference is not statistically significant (P = .20 ,  two-tailed) .
Eighty-one of the deaths were attributed to progressive disease ,  and one death was reported without documented cause ,  the causes of death for the remaining nine patients were attributed to treatment (two patients ,  discussed above) ,  myocardial infarctions (five , three of whom had a suspected recurrence) ,  stroke (one) ,  and metastatic disease resulting from a new primary tumor arising in the bile duct (one) .
The one death with no cause reported was on the escalating 5-FU arm .
There is no difference between the two arms with respect to the survival distributions (P = .58 ,  two-tailed) .
Median survival has not been reached in either treatment arm .
A stage-wise comparison of the results of this study with GI 7175 in which the same staging criteria of GI 7175 were applied to GI 7180 shows that reducing the chemotherapeutic regimen of 5-FU and MeCCNU from 18 months to 12 months did not significantly alter the survival outcome for patients .
The results of this study indicate that treatment after surgical resection of Dukes B2 and C rectal cancer with escalating 5-FU postradiation therapy provides similar survival and recurrence outcomes as a postradiation chemotherapeutic regimen including the leukemogen MeCCNU .
Because of toxicity ,  patients often received no therapy beyond the initial radiation treatment .
Results from the previous GITSG study (GI 7175) of adjuvant therapy after surgical resection of Dukes B2 or C rectal cancer demonstrated improved survival and disease-free survival in patients treated with combination radiation therapy and post radiation therapy using 5-FU and MeCCNU when compared with surgery alone ,  and improved disease-free survival for patients treated with this combined modality therapy compared with radiation therapy alone .
Although data from the initial rectal cancer adjuvant trial conducted by the National Surgical Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP RO1) suggested improved survival and disease-free survival in patients treated with chemotherapy alone compared with surgery alone ,  that study did not include a combined modality treatment arm .
A recent National Institutes of Health consensus conference on adjuvant therapy for patients with colon and rectal cancer concluded that combined postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy improved local control and survival in stage B2 and C patients with rectal cancer and that treatment with combined modality therapy in these patients is recommended .
GI 7180 ,  a protocol designed more than a decade ago ,  used a treatment plan that most likely is now outdated .
Different methods of 5-FU administration (eg ,  rapid infusion ,  prolonged continuous infusion) have been compared in an attempt to maximize radiation sensitization and further reduce the rate of locoregional recurrence .
It appears highly unlikely that further follow-up in GI 7180 will result in 5-FU and MeCCNU treatment being superior to escalating 5-FU .
