Introduction .
Rectal cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases with 11 500 cases diagnosed in the UK in 1994 alone .
Little change has been seen in survival rates ,  which remain at about 40% at 5 years from diagnosis .
The aim was to increase the number of patients in whom curative resection could be done ,  and so improve survival rates .
We gained local ethics committee approval for the study and consent from the participants .
Two parallel opposed fields 18 cm by 15 cm were positioned to cover the tumour with an adequate proximal margin (normally 5 cm). 20 daily fractions of 2 Gy at the mid-plane central axis of the volume of the tumour were given over 4 weeks .
For all these endpoints ,  event-free times were censored at 5 years from randomisation ,  because at this point a large proportion of surviving patients had been discharged from hospital follow-up ,  and accurate continuing data on disease recurrence were no longer available .
Statistical analysis .
Based on accrual to the previous MRC preoperative radiotherapy trial ,  we expected that this number would be accrued in 4 to 5 years .
Proportions were compared by the  2 test ,  and ordered categorical data by the Mann-Whitney test .
All analyses were carried out by intention to treat .
After 7 years of accrual ,  only slightly more than half the required number of patients had been entered .
Of the 279 patients ,  217 died .
There was no evidence of an excess of complications in the radiotherapy group .
Pathological assessment of the resected tissue was done for patients from both treatment groups (table 4) .
However ,  the number of lymph nodes examined was lower in the radiotherapy group .
However ,  the data are compatible with a reduction in the risk of as much as a half or as little as 2% .
Necropsy was done rarely and so causes of death should be interpreted with caution .
Discussion .
Failure to recruit the planned number of patients is reflected in the wide 95% CI seen for each of the main endpoints .
There was evidence of benefit from preoperative radiotherapy before the trial .
Also there was a general misinterpretation of the outcome of the initial trial of low-dose radiotherapy .
In addition ,  the patients selected for this study represent only a small proportion of total operable cases .
None of these studies has concentrated specifically on locally advanced tumours .
