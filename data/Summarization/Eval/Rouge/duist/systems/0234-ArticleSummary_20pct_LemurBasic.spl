fifty four patients with advanced breast cancer who had failed prior nonanthracycline combination chemotherapy were randomized to treatment with either epirubicin 85 mg m2 or doxorubicin 60 mg m2 intravenously every three weeks 
laboratory evidence of cardiotoxicity was defined as a decrease in resting left ventricular ejection fraction of 10 from the baseline value or a decrease of 5 or greater with exercise compared with the resting study performed on the same day 
in retrospective studies the incidence of symptomatic congestive heart failure chf was estimated to be approximately 3 to 4 after a cumulative dox dose of 450 mg m2 and 6 to 10 after 550 mg m2 the incidence of chf rises steeply after higher cumulative doses on the basis of these retrospective studies an empiric dose limitation of 450 to 550 mg m2 has been recommended when dox is used on a standard every three week schedule 
cardiac monitoring with noninvasive techniques and endomyocardial biopsy identifypatients being treated with dox who have asymptomatic functional or morphologic cardiac abnormalities and who may be at high risk for the development of clinical congestive cardiomyopathy 
we used multigated radionuclide cineangiocardiography rnca to assess cardiac toxicity in this prospective randomized study comparing the efficacy acute and chronic toxicities of epi with dox in patients with advanced breast cancer 
other criteria for eligibility included a performance status of 50 karnofsky scale a wbc count 4 000 14l a platelet count 100 000 l normal serum bilirubin levels 1 5 mg dl and objectively evaluable or measurable disease 
pretreatment evaluation and follow up studies pretreatment evaluation of patients included complete history and physical examination complete blood cell count cbc 12 channel biochemical profile serum creatinine chest roentgenogram ecg and bone scan 
evaluation of responsethe criteria for evaluation of therapeutic response were based on the recommendations of the breast cancer task force of the national cancer institute bethesda md 17 these guidelines were modified to include a minor response mr category for those patients with unequivocal therapeutic responses but less than that required for a partial response pr 
evaluation of toxicitythe percent of projected dose received was calculated for each patient as the average of all doses the patient received mg m 2 85 if the patient was randomized to epi and 60 if the patient was randomized to dox 
therefore for this study laboratory cardiac toxicity was defined as decrease in resting lvef of 10 from pretreatment baseline or a decrease in lvef with stress of 5 from the resting baseline obtained on the same day 
in the case of dox at a cumulative dose of 50 mg m2 patients were offered the option to discontinue therapy or to continue with close monitoring of cardiac function with rnca 
eight patients on the epi arm and 14 on the dox arm had received prior radiotherapy to the chest mediastinum or thoracic spine that may have exposed the myocardium to ionizing radiation 
the additional patient randomized to epi died with progressive breast cancer and nadir sepsis 15 days after her first dose of epi she is excluded from analysis of therapeutic results but is included in the analysis of hematologic toxicity 
the inevaluable patient randomized to treatment with dox refused to return for follow up counts or further therapy but was alive four months after her only dose of dox the patient is also excluded from analysis of hematologic toxicity 
there was no difference log rank test p 90 in the median time to progression between the patients on the epi arm 3 9 months and those on the dox arm 5 1 months 
the median wbc nadir was 2 0 x 103 gl range 0 1 to 8 6 and the median platelet nadir was 132 x 103 pl range 20 0 to 279 0 in patients receiving epi the median wbc nadir was 1 8 x 10 3tl range 0 3 to 9 and median platelet nadir was 130 x 103 pl range 24 0 to 253 0 in patients on the dox arm 
because all patients had been treated previously with chemotherapy the degree and incidence of alopecia is difficult to assess however hair loss was noted in 50 of patients treated with epi and 35 of those treated with dox 
of the 15 evaluable patients treated with epi six had received prior radiotherapy to the chest wall internal mammary lymph nodes sternum or thoracic spine prior to entry on this study and two had a history of well controlled mild hypertension 
of the ten remaining patients on the epi arm and elevenpatients on the dox arm who are not evaluable for laboratory cardiac toxicity because they did not have a second rnca study the total cumulative doses of epi and dox were not significantly different whether or not myelosuppressiveequivalent doses were taken into consideration 
the cumulative doses of epi at which clinical chf was observed 1 035 1 105 1 162 and 1 234 mg m 2 were approximately twice the cumulative doses of dox at which chf was seen 456 480 492 560 and 600 mg m2 
one of the patients who developed chf on the dox arm is the patient who had the initial resting lvef of 48 this patient also had a history of pulmonary emboli and it was unclear whether this contributed to her cardiac decompensation 
thirteen percent of patients in another recent study developed chf at a median dose of 405 mg m 2 when dox was given on an every three week schedule 22 with optimal monitoring one might be able to detect subclinical cardiac injury and prevent chf by stopping the drug this implies however the interruption of effective antineoplastic therapy 
the use of potentially cardioprotective agents such as vitamin e n acetylcysteine and icrf 187 has been suggested but the data have not been sufficiently promising to warrant large scale clinical trials 
although endomyocardial biopsy is probably the definitive measure of cardiac injury rnca has the advantage of being noninvasive and therefore acceptable to virtually all patients in a randomized study of antineoplastic agents 
the therapeutic index of an agent is defined by the relationship between the dosage required to produce therapeutic and toxic effects and by the magnitude of the favorable or unfavorable effects observed 
the difference in cardiac toxicity was manifested by the difference in total cumulative dose at which changes in lvef occurred fig 2a as well as by the difference in dose at which clinical chf was seen epi 1 035 to 1 234 mg m 2 v dox 456 to 600 mg m2 
although these results could have been affected by the greater incidence of cardiac irradiation inpatients treated with dox only three patients who had received such radiotherapy actually developed chf one on the epi arm and two on the dox arm 
in the murine tumor model systems equal doses of epi and dox produce equal therapeutic effects with less host toxicity in the epi treated mice but a clinical assessment can only be based on studies in humans 
a third study34 compared two multidrug combinations in which 5 fluorouracil f 500 mg m2 and cyclophosphamide c 500 mg m2 were combined with an equal dosage 50 mg m2 of either epi fec 5 fluorouracil epi cyclophosphamidel or dox fac and administered every three weeks the total dose of epi was limited to 750 mg m2 and of dox to 550 mg m2 
in the milan study the complete plus partial response rate to epi was 5 11 and to dox 7 15 fec produced a major response rate of 45 compared to a 43 response rate to fac 
since the present study did not use a fixed limitation for dose of epi patients who did not have progression of tumor were treated to the point of laboratory cardiotoxicity or clinical chf therefore this study provides cumulative cardiotoxicity data that are not available in the other two studies 
the other studies which did use dose limits provided data that could confirm the reliability of the survival analysis method we have used to assess the dose effect relationships with regard to rnca changes 
in the other single agent study in which there was an empiric dose limitation of 600 mg m2 none of the seven epitreated patients who had rnca experienced a decline in lvef of 10 
although the numbers are small in the milan study three of five patients treated with dox in whom rnca was performed showed a decrease in lvef of more than 10 375 450 and 525 mg m2 
most patients in our trials received less than 550 mg m2 of epi however in 11 patients receiving cumulative epi doses from 550 to 1 465 mg m2 rnca abnormalities were observed in only four patients at 970 1 180 1 190 and 1 465 mg m2 respectively cw 
assuming equal therapeutic potency this analysis indicated that every three week epi is less cardiotoxic than every three week dox p 0005 and borderline less toxic than weekly dox p 06 
although at times a decrease in lvef was observed immediately before the development of chf we were unable to confirm the previously described pattern of predictable progressive decline in lvef over time for all patients 6 many patients maintained their left ventricular function at the baseline value until it worsened abruptly shortly before or at the time that clinical chf was observed 
the sudden onset of clinical deterioration was also reported bybristow who considered this a manifestation of a nonlinear relationship between myocardial structure and function 3 6 likewise changes in lvef in response to stress frequently accompanied a decline in lvef but we did not observe such a decline without a concommittant change in resting lvef 
thus while assessment of lvef by rnca was useful in quantitating changes in cardiacfunction for the purposes of this study it cannot be recommended for routine monitoring of individual patients as a predictor of impending cardiac failure 
our results show that epi has therapeutic activity that is similar to that of dox in patients with advanced breast cancer and that epi is a less cardiotoxic drug than dox even accounting for the difference in myelosuppressive potency 
in this study worsening cardiac function forced the premature discontinuation of dox therapy in three patients experiencing partial responses whereas effective treatment with epi was never discontinued because of cardiac toxicity 
in addition the preliminary results from the fec v fac combination chemotherapy trial suggest that epi should be studied further in combination with other active agents in patients with advanced breast cancer
