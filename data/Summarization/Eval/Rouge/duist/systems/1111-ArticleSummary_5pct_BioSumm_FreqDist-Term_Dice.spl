Additional risk factors for recurrence ,  e.g. ,  large tumor diameter (LTD) ,  deep stromal invasion (DSI) ,  and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces (CLS) found on microscopic examination have been only recently recognized and less extensively investigated than lymph node metastases .
An analysis of data on 575 women enrolled in a previous Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) study of clinical and pathologic predictors of surgically treated stage carcinoma of the cervix confirmed the roles of LTD ,  DSI ,  and CLS as risk factors ,  increasing the probability of cancer recurrence at 3 years from 2 to 31% .
In 1988 the GOG initiated a prospective randomized study (GOG #92) ,  reported here ,  to investigate the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy for Stage I cervical cancer patients treated by conventional radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who were at high risk for recurrence ,  because of LTD ,  DSI ,  CLS ,  but excluding patients with lymph node metastases .
The GOG #92 multicenter prospective randomized study was designed to determine whether postoperative pelvic radiotherapy following radical hysterectomy and pelvic node dissection would reduce the rate of recurrence and decrease the mortality in Stage IB cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter ,  deep stromal invasion by tumor ,  and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces found on microscopic examination .
Other eligibility criteria for enrollment into the study included normal blood counts ,  normal liver and kidney function ,  absence of genitourinary tract abnormality as determined by intravenous pyelogram ,  renal sonogram ,  or computerized tomography ,  and absence of intercurrent diseases or other conditions that might not permit completion of the study or the required follow-up .
All histology slides were reviewed by two pathologists of the GOG Pathology Committee who measured the depth of stromal invasion expressed in thirds of cervical thickness and ascertained the presence or absence of the capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement and the tumor cell type .
There were 128 (46%) patients with the risk factors of positive CLS and deep one-third stromal invasion ,  65 (23%) had positive CLS ,  middle third stromal invasion and tumor size $2 cm ,  82 (30%) had negative CLS ,  middle or deep third stromal invasion and a $4-cm tumor ,  and 2 (0.7%) had positive CLS ,  superficial stromal invasion ,  and tumor size $5 cm (Table 3) .
A detailed GOG clinical pathologic study had established that certain patients with poor prognostic factors related to the primary tumor (i.e. ,  large tumor size ,  deep stromal invasion ,  and capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement) but without lymph node involvement had a risk of recurrence of 31% after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy .
