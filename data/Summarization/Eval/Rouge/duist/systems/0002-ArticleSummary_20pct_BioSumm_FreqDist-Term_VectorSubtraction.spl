CERVICAL cancer is the second most frequent cancer among women worldwide and the most frequent cancer among women in Africa ,  Asia ,  and South America .
Radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea has been compared in separate trials with radiotherapy alone ,  with radiotherapy and concomitant therapy with misonidazole ,  and with radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil (and Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) .
METHODS .
Eligibility .
The institutions that participated in the study are listed in the Appendix .
Radiotherapy .
Interstitial and high-dose brachytherapy were not allowed .
The duration of the radiotherapy was 10 weeks .
Chemotherapy .
Statistical Analysis .
The performance of these interim tests raised the type I error by only 0.05 percent .
RESULTS .
Characteristics of the Patients .
There were no significant differences in the clinical characteristics among the three treatment groups (Table 2) .
The analyses reported here were performed in December 1998 .
Progression-free Survival .
Survival .
The median duration of follow-up was 35 months .
Survival rates were also significantly better in these two groups (P=0.004 and P=0.002 ,  respectively) than in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy (Fig. 2) .
Site of Progression .
Chemotherapy .
Radiotherapy .
Adverse Effects .
There were no treatment-related deaths .
DISCUSSION .
Despite improvements in radiation equipment and techniques ,  in approximately two thirds of the cases ,  progression occurs within the area that was irradiated .
Thus ,  locoregional control must be improved .
Nevertheless ,  there were no significant differences in the length of radiotherapy among the three groups .
In our study ,  the duration of radiotherapy and the dose of radiation were similar among the three regimens , implying that the differences in progression-free survival and survival were related to the chemotherapy .
