THE American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics define stage IB cervical cancer as invasive cancer that is confined to the cervix ,  with a depth of more than 5 mm and a width of more than 7 mm. In patients with large stage IB cervical cancers ,  local control and survival are poorer than in patients with smaller stage I cancers ,  whether treated by surgery or irradiation .
In a previous randomized trial of combined external and intracavitary irradiation alone or followed by extrafascial hysterectomy ,  the Gynecologic Oncology Group found that hysterectomy did not improve survival ,  but it did significantly reduce the rate of relapse in the pelvic region (unpublished data) .
Women of any age with biopsy-proved primary squamous-cell carcinoma ,  adenocarcinoma ,  or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix of stage IB (exophytic or expansile barrel-shaped tumors with a minimal diameter of 4 cm) were eligible for the study .
Inaddition ,  patients could have no radiographic evidence of lymphadenopathy on computed tomographic scanning or lymphangiography ,  and in those with enlarged or suspicious-appearing lymph nodes ,  no evidence of cancer on fine-needle aspiration or histologic evaluation .
Patients with histologic evidence of lymph-node involvementwere not eligible ,  nor were those who had previously received radiotherapy or chemotherapy or those with a history of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer .
All patients were required to have a Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status of 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  or 3 (equivalent to Karnofsky performance scores of 90 or 100 ,  70 or 80 ,  50 or 60 ,  and 30 or 40 ,  respectively) and adequate bone marrow ,  renal function ,  and hepatic function .
Written informed consent was obtained before entry into the study ,  fulfilling all institutional ,  state ,  and federal regulations .
External irradiation was withheld if the white-cell count fell below 1000 per cubic millimeter and was resumed once the count rose above that level .
The dose to point A (a reference location 2 cm lateral and 2 cm superior to the cervical os) was 30 Gy ,  for a cumulative dose of 75 Gy ,  and the cumulative dose to point B (the pelvic wall) was 55 Gy .
We estimated that 173 patients were needed in each treatment group in order to be able to detect a 40 percent decrease in the recurrence rate in the group given radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
The design called for a final analysis when 56 events (recurrences or deaths) had occurred in patients receiving the control regimen (radiotherapy alone) and provided the study with a statistical power of 80 percent with use of the log-rank test and a one-sided significance level of 0.05 .
Two scheduled interim analyses were conducted during the enrollment phase of the trial ,  the first was conducted after 29 recurrences had been reported ,  and the second after 47 recurrences had been reported .
Four were subsequently excluded after a central review by the pathology committee found that the specimen was inadequate for evaluation in the case of one patient , the primary lesion had been misidentified in the case of one patient ,  the cell type had been misidentified in the case of one patient ,  and the stage of the tumor had been overestimated in the case of one patient .
All patients had primary cervical cancers that were at least 4 cm in diameter ,  and the distribution of the tumors according to size was similar in the two groups .
A total of 164 patients (90 percent) received four or more courses of cisplatin .
The median weekly dose of cisplatin was 39.0 mg per square meter (10th and 90th percentiles ,  32.3 and 40.3 ,  respectively ,  range ,  0 to 49.7) .
Cox multiple regression analysis showed that the size of the tumor as assessed by physical examination and the histologic grade of the tumor were both significant prognostic factors .
Adjustment for these factors had no significant effect on the differences between the groups in survival and progression-free survival .
In 1992 ,  when the current study was initiated ,  complete data on survival in the earlier trial were not available ,  but an early analysis showed a significantly lower rate of relapses in the pelvic region among women who underwent hysterectomy .
In the earlier Gynecologic Oncology Group study that assessed the value of extrafascial hysterectomy after radiotherapy ,  surgery was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of relapses in the pelvic region ,  but the overall risk of recurrence was not significantly reduced (relative risk ,  0.76 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.52 to 1.12) and there was no significant difference in survival (relative risk of death ,  0.91) .
The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment ,  but they share a common result ,  all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin .
