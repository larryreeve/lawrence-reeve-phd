the first uk medical research council mrc trial of preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer was a three arm randomised trial with 824 patients comparing a control surgery alone group with a group treated with 20 gy given in 10 equal fractions and another treated with a single exposure of 5 gy 
despite the suggestion of a real biological effect of the radiotherapy in the first mrc trial with significant changes in tumour stage no advantage was found for either radiotherapy group over the control group in terms of disease recurrence or survival 
in 1981 the mrc began this trial of a higher dose of preoperative radiotherapy in patients with fixed or partially fixed tumours of the rectum who were thought to be suitable for abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection 
eligible patients were men or women younger than 80 years who had histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum partially or totally fixed within the pelvis with the lower margin of the tumour within 15 cm of the anal verge were deemed suitable and fit for the proposed treatment and available for regular follow up were free of disseminated disease confirmed by clinical and radiological examination and had had no previous malignant disease 
two parallel opposed fields 18 cm by 15 cm were positioned to cover the tumour with an adequate proximal margin normally 5 cm 20 daily fractions of 2 gy at the mid plane central axis of the volume of the tumour were given over 4 weeks 
patients who completed 5 years follow up and those who were lost to follow up were flagged on the office of population censuses and surveys opcs register so that we would be notified of date and cause of death 
criteria for suspicion of local recurrence were pain increasing in severity and requiring medication or disturbance of bladder function induration in the perineum or pelvis on examination or palpation of a mass in the pelvis or at the anastomosis 
for the analyses the date of first local recurrence was taken as the date of the first new clinical or histological evidence of local recurrence we included an assessment of clinical evidence of local recurrence at death 
for all these endpoints event free times were censored at 5 years from randomisation because at this point a large proportion of surviving patients had been discharged from hospital follow up and accurate continuing data on disease recurrence were no longer available 
we intended to enrol 450 patients with the anticipation of 251 deaths this sample size would have provided 90 power to detect a 15 increase in the 3 year survival rate from 35 to 50 which was thought plausible at the time the trial was designed 
we decided to continue the trial only until the launch in november 1989 of the uk coordinating committee on cancer research ukcccr adjuvant x ray and fluorouracil infusion study axis for treatment of colorectal cancer 
the surviving patients were followed up for a minimum of 5 years with the exception of seven patients lost to follow up within 5 years of randomisation who could not be traced through the opcs and were censored at the date last known to be alive 
nine patients received less than the prescribed dose of radiation two received no radiotherapy because they were judged too ill three failed to complete the full treatment because of their deteriorating condition and treatment was stopped early in four patients ischiorectal abscess and perineal breakdown bowel obstruction a prearranged time for surgery and refusal to continue by the patient 
the proportion of tumours graded as dukes c was significantly lower in the radiotherapy group than in the surgery alone group 29 vs 59 p 0 0002 and the number of involved lymph nodes was also smaller 
a reduction in the risk of metastatic recurrence was found which was rather unexpectedly of a similar order to the reduction in local recurrence hazard ratio 0 66 0 46 0 95 log rank p 0 02 
of the 279 patients randomised 217 have died 114 81 of 140 patients allocated surgery alone and 103 74 of 139 patients allocated radiotherapy median survival times are 24 months and 31 months respectively 
fewer deaths were reported to have been from colorectal cancer or complications of the disease or its treatment among patients allocated preoperative radiotherapy than among those allocated surgery alone 85 vs 103 hazard ratio 0 71 0 54 0 97 p 0 02 
this estimate indicates a substantial decrease in the risk of death from colorectal cancer in patients allocated radiotherapy although the data are compatible with a halving of the risk of death from colorectal cancer at one extreme or as little as 3 reduction in risk at the other 
the reasons for investigating preoperative radiation therapy were reduction in size of the primary tumour and frequency of regional node metastases before resection a reduction in the frequency of local pelvic recurrence and of distant metastasis from cancer cells released during resection preoperative treatment can inhibit the proliferation of malignant cells whether they remain local or spread outside the pelvis after radiation radiation responsiveness of cancer cells may be greater before surgery when they are normally oxygenated than afterwards when they may be hypoxic because of surgical effects on the vasculature and a lower frequency of late radiation enteritis because the small bowel is less likely to be adherent in the pelvis 
in the earlier trial surgeons were asked only to record their preoperative findings with respect to fixity but in this trial they were asked to base a crucial decision on type of treatment on these observations 
patients in the preoperative radiotherapy treatment group in which a moderately high dose of radiation was to be used had their surgery delayed by 2 months 1 month to cover the radiotherapy fractionation and a further month for tumour regression to occur and for the normal tissues to recover from the radiation 
whereas surgeons showed little reluctance to accept the 2 weeks of low dose radiation of the first trial especially because there was no requirement for further delay before the operation they were reluctant to allow their patients to be open to what they saw as the risks of delayed surgical treatment in this trial 
pahlman and glimelius reported evidence that the reduction in volume of tissue irradiated through three portals instead of the two used in this and most other trials has resulted in reduced postoperative morbidity and mortality 
since the trial was closed surgeons have been entering patients in large numbers into the axis trial in which there is randomisation with respect to preoperative radiation for patients with rectal cancer with the swedish model of short high dose therapy
