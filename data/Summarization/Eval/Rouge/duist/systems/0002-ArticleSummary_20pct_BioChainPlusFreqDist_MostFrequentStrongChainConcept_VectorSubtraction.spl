As a result ,  about 25 percent of patients with cervical cancer in the United States present with locally advanced disease (stage IIB through IVA according to the staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) .
Moreover ,  radiotherapy could be used for local disease while chemotherapy is used for systemic disease .
The Gynecologic Oncology Group has performed several prospective ,  randomized studies of the effect of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in women with locally advanced cervical cancer .
Radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea has been compared in separate trials with radiotherapy alone ,  with radiotherapy and concomitant therapy with misonidazole ,  and with radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil (and Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) .
As compared with radiotherapy alone ,  treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy significantly increased the rate of complete response ,  progression-free survival ,  and overall survival .
As compared with treatment with misonidazole and radiotherapy ,  treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy increased progression-free survival and was less toxic .
However ,  treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and radiotherapy resulted in greater improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival than did treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy (Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) .
At the time we were developing the protocol used in the current study ,  radiotherapy plus concomitant chemotherapy with hydroxyurea was the standard combined-therapy regimen for advanced cervical cancer ,  because an early analysis of the combination of radiation ,  cisplatin ,  and fluorouracil failed to show improved progression-free survival .
Radiotherapy .
Radiotherapy was administered to the whole pelvic region in 24 fractions totaling 40.8 Gy or 30 fractions totaling 51.0 Gy ,  followed one to three weeks later by intracavitary brachytherapy (the insertion of a radioactive implant) .
Radiotherapy was withheld if a patient had a leukocyte count of less than 2000 per cubic millimeter ,  and delays of up to one week were also allowed in the event of radiation-related gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicity .
The design called for final analysis when disease progression (or death) had occurred in 104 patients receiving the control regimen (radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea) .
The Cox model was used to adjust for prognostic factors and to estimate the relative likelihood (and 95 percent confidence intervals) of survival and progression-free survival .
After adjustment for these five factors ,  the relative risks of disease progression for the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea were extremely close (relative risks ,  0.58 and 0.55 ,  respectively) to the estimates obtained after adjustment for clinical stage of disease alone .
The rates of progression-free survival at 24 months were 67 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  64 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 47 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
As of this writing ,  75 percent of the patients have either died or have been followed for 30 months .
A total of 205 patients have died (39 percent) ,  59 in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  57 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 89 in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
After adjustment for the clinical stage of disease ,  the relative risk of death was 0.61 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.44 to 0.85) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0.58 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.41 to 0.81) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
Survival rates were also significantly better in these two groups (P=0.004 and P=0.002 ,  respectively) than in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy (Fig. 2) .
Patients in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea had less local progression (19 percent and 20 percent ,  respectively) than those in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy (30 percent) .
Patients in the two cisplatin-treated groups also had a lower frequency of lung metastases (3 percent and 4 percent ,  respectively) than patients treated with hydroxyurea alone (10 percent) .
Radiotherapy .
Eight patients did not receive any radiation therapy ,  and 41 (8 percent) received only external-beam treatment ,  but these 49 patients were evenly distributed among the three treatment groups .
The number of patients who received within 15 percent of the prescribed total dose to both point A (69 to 93 Gy) and point B (stage IIB ,  47 to 63 Gy ,  stage III or IVA ,  51 to 59 Gy) was 159 (90 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  147 (85 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 149 (84 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
Pelvic radiotherapy by itself fails to control the progression of cervical cancer in 35 to 90 percent of patients with locally advanced disease .
In a study of 19 human cervical-cancer cell lines ,  Britten et al. found that radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin increased the rates of death of these tumor cells .
In the phase 3 study by Morris et al. ,  whose results are reported in this issue of the Journal ,  radiotherapy in combination with treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil significantly improved the rates of disease-free survival and overall survival among women with stage IB through IVA cervical cancer .
Souhami et al. used radiotherapy concurrently with treatment with cisplatin ,  followed by high-dose brachytherapy ,  to treat 50 patients with cervical cancer .
They found a high rate of response ,  but 28 percent of their patients had severe late gastrointestinal complications .
