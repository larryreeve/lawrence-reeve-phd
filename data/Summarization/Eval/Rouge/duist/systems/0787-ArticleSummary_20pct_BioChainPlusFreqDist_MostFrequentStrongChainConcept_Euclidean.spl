In an attempt to increase the rate of curative resection and hence survival ,  several trials have investigated the role of preoperative radiotherapy in treatment of rectal cancer .
These doses of radiation were chosen after trials by the Veterans Administration Surgical Adjuvant Group and the Princess Margaret Hospital ,  Toronto ,  suggested survival advantage with radiotherapy for patients with tumours of Dukes stage C .
Despite the suggestion of a real biological effect of the radiotherapy in the first MRC trial ,  with significant changes in tumour stage ,  no advantage was found for either radiotherapy group over the control group in terms of disease recurrence or survival .
However ,  the trial did demonstrate the importance of fixity as a prognostic factor. 80% of mobile tumours had apparently curative resections compared with 50% of partially fixed ,  and 30% of fixed tumours .
The importance of fixity was reflected in the survival pattern ,  5-year survival for fixed or partially fixed tumours was just 29% compared with 48% for mobile tumours .
In 1981 ,  the MRC began this trial of a higher dose of preoperative radiotherapy in patients with fixed or partially fixed tumours of the rectum who were thought to be suitable for abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection .
Eligibility was confirmed and treatment allocated by minimisation on three factors ,  treatment centre ,  extension of tumour (fixed or partially fixed) ,  and intended operation (abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection) .
Megavoltage radiotherapy was started as soon as possible after randomisation .
Survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method ,  and compared by the Mantel-Cox version of the log-rank test .
Of the 139 patients who had radiotherapy and surgery 69 (50%) had fixed tumours and 70 (50%) had fixed tumours .
Abdominoperineal excision was the intended operation for about two-thirds of patients in both groups .
Of patients who received radiotherapy ,  61 (45%) of 137 reported no significant morbidity. 45 (33%) of all patients suffered diarrhoea and 30 (22%) had skin reactions .
The distribution of type of surgery done was very similar in the two treatment groups (table 2) ,  with about half the patients in each group having abdominoperineal excision .
Of patients allocated radiotherapy ,  73 (55%) were found to have no residual disease ,  compared with 66 (48%) of the patients who had surgery alone .
Of patients allocated surgery alone ,  56 (40%) of 140 were thought to have had curative operations compared with 66 (47%) of 139 patients allocated radiotherapy (p=0.21) .
Among those who had abdominoperineal excision ,  four of 49 patients who had surgery alone who were assessable at 12 months had complications of the perineal wound compared with seven of 56 patients allocated radiotherapy .
The hazard ratio is 0¡¤68 (95% CI of 0.47-0.98) ,  which suggests that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by a third .
Of the 279 patients randomised ,  217 have died ,  114 (81%) of 140 patients allocated surgery alone and 103 (74%) of 139 patients allocated radiotherapy ,  median survival times are 24 months and 31 months ,  respectively .
The hazard ratio for death from any cause is 0.79 ,  giving an estimated reduction in the risk of death for patients allocated radiotherapy of 21% (log-rank p=0.10) .
Fewer deaths were reported to have been from colorectal cancer or complications of the disease or its treatment among patients allocated preoperative radiotherapy than among those allocated surgery alone (85 vs 103 ,  hazard ratio 0.71 [0.54-0.97] ,  p=0.02) .
This estimate indicates a substantial decrease in the risk of death from colorectal cancer in patients allocated radiotherapy ,  although the data are compatible with a halving of the risk of death from colorectal cancer at one extreme or as little as 3% reduction in risk at the other .
The effects of radiotherapy on recurrence of cancer and survival are similar to the estimates on which the trial design was based .
In line with the earlier trials we found no increased frequency of early or late complications in the patients who received radiotherapy .
In that study of 466 patients ,  the survival benefit of 69% in the treated group versus 59% in the surgery-only group also failed to achieve statistical significance (log rank p=0.08) .
