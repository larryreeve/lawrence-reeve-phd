TRIALS of postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer conducted during the 1960s and 1970s showed significant reductions in rates of locoregional recurrence but no improvement in overall survival .
Additional concern was raised by data suggesting that irradiated patients have reduced survival rates ,  due to either immune suppression or cardiac complications .
In the late 1970s ,  adjuvant chemotherapy became a standard treatment for high-risk premenopausal patients with breast cancer .
Nevertheless ,  there are reasons to reconsider radiotherapy ,  including the limited value of adjuvant chemotherapy for bulky disease ,  a synergistic effect of chemotherapy plus radiation on residual locoregional tumor ,  and the possibility that eliminating bulky disease with radiation may improve the effect of chemotherapy ,  because chemotherapy may be more effective when the overall disease burden is low .
From 1979 through 1986 ,  318 premenopausal women with newly diagnosed stage I or II breast cancer were enrolled in the study after undergoing modified radical mastectomy if ,  after axillary-node dissection ,  one or more level I or II lymph nodes were found to be positive on pathological examination .
After written informed consent was obtained ,  the patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups ,  those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy plus locoregional radiotherapy in five fields (the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group ,  with 164 patients) and those receiving chemotherapy alone (the chemotherapy group ,  with 154 patients) .
The chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (600 mg per square meter of body-surface area) ,  methotrexate (40 mg per square meter) ,  and fluorouracil (600 mg per square meter) (the CMF regimen) ,  given intravenously every 21 days as described by Bonadonna et al. ,  initially for 12 months (80 patients) ,  and in the case of patients randomized after 1981 ,  for 6 months .
Also ,  as part of a second randomization ,  68 patients with estrogen-positive tumors were treated with radiationinduced ovarian ablation that included 20 Gy over a period of five days plus prednisone (7.5 mg per day) for two years ,  as described by Meakin et al. Among these 68 patients ,  33 were assigned to chemotherapy and 35 were assigned to chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
Eleven patients (3.5 percent) were lost to follow-up — three (1.9 percent) from the chemotherapy group and eight (4.9 percent) from the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group .
Of the 164 patients randomly assigned to chemotherapy and radiotherapy ,  12 did not receive radiotherapy and were treated with chemotherapy alone (7 declined radiotherapy ,  3 had metastases before radiotherapy ,  and 2 had postsurgical complications) .
There was an overall reduction of 34 percent in the rate of systemic recurrence (relative risk ,  0.66 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.49 to 0.89 ,  P 0.006) in the group treated with combined therapy (75 of 164 patients vs. 94 of 154 patients in the group treated only with chemotherapy) ,  and a 17-percentage-point improvement in systemic disease-free survival (Fig. 2) .
The rate of locoregional recurrence was reduced by 56 percent (relative risk ,  0.44 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.26 to 0.77 ,  P 0.003) in the group given chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (19 events ,  vs. 36 events in the group treated with chemotherapy only) ,  for an absolute improvement of 20 percent in survival free of local disease .
Mortality from breast cancer was reduced by 29 percent in the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group (relative risk ,  0.71 ,  95 percent confidence interval , 0.51 to 0.99 ,  P 0.05) ,  with 62 deaths ,  as compared with 76 in the chemotherapy-only group ,  which represented an improvement of 10 percentage points in breast-cancer–specific survival (Fig. 3) .
There were 66 deaths in the group given the combined treatment and 78 deaths in the chemotherapy group ,  for a 26 percent reduction in overall mortality at 15 years (relative risk ,  0.74 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.53 to 1.02 ,  P 0.07) and an 8 percent improvement in overall survival (Table 2 and Fig. 4) .
The meta-analysis performed by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group , 1 which analyzed all the randomized radiation trials begun before 1985 ,  found a 67 percent reduction in rates of locoregional relapse (P 0.001) and a 6 percent reduction in mortality from breast cancer (P 0.03) ,  but no improvement in overall survival .
Of these ,  only the Danish study found that radiotherapy had a benefit of a magnitude similar to that in our trial ,  and there was a significant survival benefit in favor of radiotherapy (P 0.001) .
The patients in that study were similar to those in our cohort ,  there was a large and homogeneous group of premenopausal ,  node-positive patients treated with chemotherapy and five-field radiotherapy .
The other eight studies were notsimilar to ours or the Danish trial ,  either because the number of randomized premenopausal patients was small or because the radiotherapy techniques or the chemotherapy schedules were heterogeneous .
Four randomized trials comparing breast irradiation with no irradiation in patients who underwent conservative surgery showed significant reductions in the rate of relapse in the breast but no effect on systemic recurrences or overall survival .
