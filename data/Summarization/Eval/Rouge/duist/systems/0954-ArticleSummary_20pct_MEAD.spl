TRIALS of postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer conducted during the 1960s and 1970s showed significant reductions in rates of locoregional recurrence but no improvement in overall survival .
This result has been attributed to micrometastases which determine prognosis regardless of the effect of the locoregional therapy .
Additional concern was raised by data suggesting that irradiated patients have reduced survival rates due to either immune suppression or cardiac complications .
In the late 1970s adjuvant chemotherapy became a standard treatment for high-risk premenopausal patients with breast cancer .
To test the hypothesis that adding radiation to adjuvant systemic therapy improves the outcome in patients with breast cancer we designed a randomized trial in 1978 in British Columbia .
From 1979 through 1986 318 premenopausal women with newly diagnosed stage I or II breast cancer were enrolled in the study after undergoing modified radical mastectomy if after axillary-node dissection one or more level I or II lymph nodes were found to be positive on pathological examination .
After written informed consent was obtained the patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy plus locoregional radiotherapy in five fields the chemotherapyradiotherapy group with 164 patients and those receiving chemotherapy alone the chemotherapy group with 154 patients .
The surgery was performed by specialists who referred all the patients to the British Columbia Cancer Agency the provincial cancer institute for registration randomization and the planning of the chemotherapy and radiation treatments .
Of the 164 patients randomly assigned to chemotherapy and radiotherapy 12 did not receive radiotherapy and were treated with chemotherapy alone 7 declined radiotherapy 3 had metastases before radiotherapy and 2 had postsurgical complications .
There was no difference with regard to any survival end point between the patients who had 12 months of chemotherapy and those who had only 6 months P 0.60 for disease-free survival at 15 years P 0.70 for overall survival .
These values translate into an overall reduction of 33 percent in the rate of recurrence of breast cancer relative risk 0.67 95 percent confidence interval 0.50 to 0.90 P 0.007 with an improvement of 17 percentage points in disease-free survival at the 15-year followup Fig. 1. Mortality from breast cancer was reduced by 29 percent in the chemotherapyradiotherapy group relative risk 0.71 95 percent confidence interval0.51 to 0.99 P 0.05 with 62 deaths as compared with 76 in the chemotherapy-only group which represented an improvement of 10 percentage points in breast-cancerspecific survival Fig. 3. Among the 94 patients who had systemic relapses after chemotherapy alone 19 were alive at the time of the 15-year analysis as compared with 9 of the 75 patients with such relapses in the chemotherapyradiotherapy group .
Radiation also improved outcome in the 68 patients randomly assigned to ovarian ablation in regard to disease-free survival relative risk 0.72 survival free of systemic disease relative risk 0.76 and overall survival relative risk 0.88. It is possible that we will see additional benefit in overall survival because at this writing 19 patients in the chemotherapy group remain alive with systemic recurrence as compared with only 9 in the combined-treatment group most of these 28 patients are expected to die of breast cancer .
The patients in that study were similar to those in our cohort there was a large and homogeneous group of premenopausal node-positive patients treated with chemotherapy and five-field radiotherapy .
Locoregional radiation is not routinely used at present in patients with node-positive breast cancer although it is coming into use to treat patients with 10 or more positive nodes and occasionally those with 4 or more positive nodes .
The elimination of locoregional cancer cells by radiotherapy added to adjuvant chemotherapy may reduce mortality in selected patients with breast cancer .
