OF the estimated 13,700 women in the United States in whom invasive cervical cancer was diagnosed in 1998 ,  nearly 5000 will ultimately die of the disease because of the inadequacies of current treatment .
In the United States ,  cervical cancer disproportionately affects women who are members of minority groups and women of low socioeconomic status ,  partly because such women tend to have insufficient access to and knowledge of screening programs for cervical cancer .
The nationwide use of such screening programs has greatly reduced the incidence of invasive cervical cancer .
Women with early cervical cancer can be successfully treated with radical surgery .
Those with a large cervical lesion at presentation or with spread to the pelvic lymph nodes or other pelvic tissues are usually treated with a combination of external-beam and intracavitary radiation .
A previous study reported improved survival among women with locally advanced cervical cancer who received prophylactic radiation to the para-aortic nodes .
To eradicate micrometastases and sensitize tumor cells to radiation ,  several studies have explored the use of radiotherapy with concomitant chemotherapy .
The results of these studies are inconclusive and have been criticized because they lacked a comparison group treated with radiation alone and because the radiation therapy used may have been deficient according to current standards .
In 1990 ,  the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) began a randomized clinical trial to compare the effects on survival of treatment with extended-field radiation and treatment with pelvic radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in patients with cervical cancer .
We report the first results of this study .
METHODS .
Patients .
We enrolled women of all ages who had stages IIB through IVA squamous-cell carcinoma ,  adenocarcinoma ,  or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix according to the staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (Table 1) or stage IB or IIA of one of these cancers with a tumor diameter of at least 5 cm or biopsy-proved metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes .
Women with a Karnofsky performance score of at least 60 and blood counts and serum levels of blood urea nitrogen ,  creatinine ,  and bilirubin that were within normal ranges were eligible for the study .
Women were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria ,  disease outside the pelvic area or spread to para-aortic lymph nodes ,  a prior cancer other than cutaneous basal-cell carcinoma ,  medical contraindications to chemotherapy ,  a rare histologic subtype ,  and prior hysterectomy or transperitoneal staging procedure for cervical cancer ,  pelvic radiotherapy ,  or systemic chemotherapy .
A medical history taking and clinical examination were required before enrollment .
The initial evaluation also included chest radiography ,  cystoscopy ,  proctoscopy ,  a complete blood count ,  and measurement of liver and renal function .
The renal-collecting system of each patient was assessed by intravenous pyelography or contrast computed tomography .
Para-aortic lymph nodes wereevaluated by bipedal lymphangiography or retroperitoneal surgical exploration .
The surveillance committees of the National Cancer Institute and participating institutions approved this trial .
Patients were required to understand the trial and provide written informed consent .
Patients who completed the pretreatment evaluation and met all eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to receive extended field radiotherapy or radiotherapy to the pelvic region with concurrent treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil .
The patients in each treatment group were stratified according to the tumor stage (IB ,  IIA ,  or IIB vs. III or IVA) and the staging method used for para-aortic lymph nodes (clinical vs. surgical) .
Treatment .
External-beam radiation was delivered with anteroposterior and posteroanterior opposed beams of at least 15-MV photons or the use of four fields (anteroposterior ,  posteroanterior ,  and two lateral fields) of at least 4-MV photons .
For patients who were assigned to receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy ,  the treatment field extended from the space between L4 and L5 to the midpubis or to a line 4 cm below the most distal vaginal or cervical site of disease .
Lateral fields were designed to encompass S3 posteriorly ,  with a margin of at least 3 cm from the primary cervical tumor .
Custom shielding was designed to treat the pelvic lymph nodes ,  with a margin of at least 1 to 1.5 cm. For patients who were assigned to receive radiotherapy alone ,  the pelvic and paraaortic areas were treated as a continuous area ,  with a superiorfield border at the space between L1 and L2 .
The radiation dose was keyed to the central ray at the patient’s midplane (for anteroposterior– posteroanterior fields) or to the isocenter of the beams .
