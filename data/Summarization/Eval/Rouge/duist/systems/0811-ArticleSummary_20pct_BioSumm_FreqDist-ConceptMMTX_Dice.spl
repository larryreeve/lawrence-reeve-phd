The purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate ,  by such a randomized and controlled comparison ,  a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5-FU activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials .
Thymidine given at high doses in animal model systems has been shown to increase both therapeutic activity and toxicity of 5-FU and to improve the therapeutic index of this agent .
In the study of Woodcock et al ,  the single colorectal cancer patient treated who was not a prior 5-FU failure had a response of 8 months duration .
Overall therapeutic results were discouraging ,  specifically in colorectal cancer ,  a Mayo Clinic study demonstrated only one response among 30 patients ,  a study of the Baltimore Cancer Research Program showed no responses among 21 patients ,  and a New York Memorial study demonstrated only two minor responses among 19 evaluated patients .
Continued interest in PALA ,  however ,  was stimulated by animal model evidence that this agent inhibits pyrimidine synthesis and thereby enhances 5-FU activity by increasing its conversion to fluorouridine monophosphate (FUMP) .
The first was a small surgical adjuvant study reported by Verhaegen et al in which levamisole-treated patients had a significantly improved survival when compared with untreated controls .
The second study ,  conducted at the University of Wisconsin (Madison) ,  showed that advanced-disease patients treated with combined 5-FU and levamisole lived significantly longer than patients treated with 5-FU alone .
If this result could be confirmed it would be the first time that any regimen has demonstrated such significant survival improvement for advanced colorectal cancer in randomized trials .
In 1981 ,  a New York Memorial study reported a 32% objective response rate among 77 patients treated with MOF-Strept .
In a randomized trial ,  this group showed that this combination produced superior response rates and survival when compared with their own variant of the 5-FU ,  methyl CCNU ,  vincristine combination .
In contrast ,  however ,  the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group reported only a 4% response rate among 41 patients treated with MOF-Strept and they discouraged further use of this combination .
We elected to use survival as our primary endpoint in patients with both measurable and nonmeasurable disease and also to evaluate objective response rates among those patients with measurable disease .
A radioactive liver scan could be used to document a measurable lesion if there was a clearly defined perfusion defect measuring at least 5 cm in greatest diameter .
Contraindications to selection included a WBC count < 4.000/mm or a platelet count < 130.000/mm. a serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL. complete disability (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group IECOG] performance score 4). recent major surgery (exploration and biopsy only. < 14 days ,  resection or bypass surgery ,  < 21 days) ,  an uncontrolled infectious process. frequent vomiting or severe anorexia ,  any previous chemotherapy ,  and intensive radiation to the axial skeleton within the preceding 4 weeks .
Tissue from each patient was submitted to a pathology review committee to ensure eligibility and proper histopathologic classification .
After determining eligibility and obtaining written informed consent ,  patients were stratified according to performance score and the presence and location of measurable disease .
Courses of therapy were repeated every 5 weeks. 5-FU plus levamisole. 5-FU was administered in undiluted form by rapid IV injection at a dose of 500 mg/m 2/d for 5 consecutive days .
The evaluation consisted of a history and physical examination ,  measurement of indicator lesions. hematology and chemistry panel (including serum creatinine) ,  urinalysis ,  and a chest x-ray .
The primary endpoint of our overall study was patient survival .
Standard criteria for declaring objective response were used. ie. a 5017 or greater reduction in the product of longest perpendicular diameters of bidimensionally measurable lesions or a 30% or greater decrease in the sum of liver measurements below the xyphoid process at costal margin .
Each combination regimen was compared to treatment with 5- FU alone with respect to duration of survival following randomization ,  time to disease progression. objective regression rates among measurable patients ,  and toxic reactions .
The log rank statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with equality of survival curves ,  while the Cox partial likelihood score statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with the hypothesis that any one of the combinations would yield at least a 50% improvement in survival over 5-FU alone .
The primary reason for ineligibility (seven patients) was failure to confirm metastatic disease according to protocol criteria .
Four patients were lost to analysis due to ineligibility or cancellation on the 5-FU alone arm ,  four patients on 5-FU plus PALA ,  two patients on 5-FU plus thymidine ,  two patients on MOF-Strept ,  and none on 5-FU plus levamisole .
MOF-Strept was characterized by substantially more frequent and more severe nausea and vomiting ,  and this was the only regimen characterized by a substantive incidence of thrombocytopenia. 5-FU plus PALA had substantially more frequent mucocutaneous reactions and somewhat more frequent diarrhea ,  but less hematologic toxicity than 5-FU alone or any of the other regimens .
These reactions were primarily headache (seven patients) ,  lethargy (four patients) ,  dizziness with ataxia (four patients) ,  and occasional confusion (two patients) .
There were three treatment-related deaths ,  one each on 5-FU alone ,  5-FU plus thymidine ,  and MOF-Strept .
It is noteworthy that while the MOF-Strept regimen had the highest regression rate ,  it was also the regimen with the lowest proportion of patients whose disease remained stable and the highest proportion of patients in whom the best response observed was tumor regression .
This factor was imbalanced among our treatment regimens ,  but this imbalance clearly weighed against the 5-FU arm that had the lowest proportion of low-grade lesions and the highest proportion of highly anaplastic tumors .
Martin has pointed out that it might be possible to obtain the full biochemical modulating effect of PALA by using a considerably lower dose of this agent ,  thereby allowing the 5-FU dose to be increased to near full therapeutic levels .
Our experience with the 5-FU-levamisole combination was particularly discouraging in view of the early study of the University of Wisconsin ,  indicating that this combination could produce substantial survival improvement .
An interesting sidelight of this study is the fact that grade of tumor anaplasia was found to be a powerful prognostic determinant ,  matching the more well-established performance status and presence or absence of measurable disease .
