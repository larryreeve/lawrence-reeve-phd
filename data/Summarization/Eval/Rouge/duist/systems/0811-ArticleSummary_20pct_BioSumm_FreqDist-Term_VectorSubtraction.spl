ADVANCED colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common oncologic challenges encountered in the Western world .
These effects presumably occur through the action of thymidine in blocking oxidative metabolism of 5-FU and increasing 5-FU incorporation into RNA .
Synergistic activity with the PALA-5-FU combination was demonstrated in murine tumor systems .
It has also been shown to have immunomodulatory effects .
METHODS .
Patient Selection .
Patients could be entered with either measurable or nonmeasurable disease .
Randomization Procedures .
Treatment Methodology .
These courses were repeated every 5 weeks .
This corresponded to the regimen used by Davis et al .
For all regimens .
WBC count and platelet counts were obtained weekly .
Evaluation of Results .
Statistical Methods .
P values were two-sided .
Early termination did not occur .
RESULTS .
A total of 347 patients were randomized on this study .
These represent 97% of all patients randomized .
It is noteworthy that most of these patients were in excellent general condition .
Toxicity .
These reactions were primarily headache (seven patients) ,  lethargy (four patients) ,  dizziness with ataxia (four patients) ,  and occasional confusion (two patients) .
One patient died in irreversible coma .
Therapeutic Results .
This was confirmed by a stratified Cox analysis ,  adjusting for key prognostic covariates ,  which indicated that the data were inconsistent with any combination regimen yielding a 50% increase in survival relative to 5-FU (ie ,  a hazard ratio of 1 .5) ,  wherefore 5-FU plus PALA ,  P < .01 ,  5-FU plus thymidine ,  P < .0001 ,  5-FU plus levamisole ,  P < .01 ,  and MOF-Strept ,  P < .05 .
DISCUSSION .
The results of this study were singularly discouraging .
In each of the regimens we tested ,  drug dosages and scheduling were admittedly largely arbitrary .
It is entirely possible that different proportionate representation of drug dosages or different scheduling could produce more favorable or less favorable results than we observed .
Our results were disappointing .
Unfortunately ,  this modulation did not translate into the therapeutic gain predicted by animal models ,  and the neurotoxicity only rarely observed with 5-FU alone was made much more prominent .
