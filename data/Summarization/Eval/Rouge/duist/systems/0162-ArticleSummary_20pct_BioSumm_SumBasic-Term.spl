SINCE JUNE 1973 ,  the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of CMF (cyclophosphamide ,  methotrexate ,  and fluorouracil) chemotherapy were evaluated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes .
Within 4 wk from surgery ,  patients with TI-3a breast cancer ,  histologically positive axillary nodes ,  age < 70 yr ,  and living fairly close to the Institute were allocated to receive either 12 or 6 cycles of CMF .
The dose of all three drugs was reduced by 50% when the leukocyte count ranged from 3900 to 2500/cu mm or the platelet count from 99,000 to 75,000/cu mm. In the presence of more severe myelosuppression ,  treatment was delayed until at least half of the dose could be administered .
Primary treatment failure was accurately assessed by clinical ,  radiologic ,  and whenever feasible ,  histologic examination of the site(s) of first relapse .
The following systemic treatment was mainly utilized ,  patients in whom estrogen receptors were positive were subjected to hormonal manipulations (ovariectomy in premenopausal women and additive hormonal therapy ,  particularly tamoxifen ,  in postmenopausal patients) ,  combined sometimes with chemotherapy .
In fact ,  the retrospective evaluation of roentgenograms revealed the presence of distant metastases prior to radical mastectomy in 3 patients (CMF 12 ,  1 ,  CMF 6 ,  2) ,  while 4 additional women (CMF 12 ,  3 ,  CMF 6 ,  1) had fixation of the primary tumor to the underlying pectoral fascia or muscle (T3b) .
Therefore ,  a total of 459 patients were found evaluable for treatment comparison ,  i.e. ,  243 women (premenopausal 160 ,  postmenopausal 83) allocated in the 12-cycle group and 216 (premenopausal 164 ,  postmenopausal 52) in the 6-cycle group ,  respectively .
Estrogen receptor (ER) status could be determined at the time of mastectomy in 255 women (55.6%) by using the dextran-coated charcoal assay ,  according to the technique currently used in our laboratory .
Prior to mastectomy ,  all patients underwent complete physical examination ,  x-ray of chest and skeleton (skull ,  spine ,  pelvis ,  upper third of femurs) ,  liver scan ,  bilateral mammography ,  hemogram ,  and biochemical tests .
Biochemical tests (serum bilirubin ,  total proteins ,  alkaline phosphatase ,  SGOT and SGPT ,  and LDH) were repeated every 6 mo during the first 3 yr and once a year thereafter .
In postmenopausal women with more than 3 nodes ,  the difference between CMF 12 (34.4%) and CMF 6 (54.9% ,  p = 0.18) is only apparent since the confidence-limits throughout the curve totally blurred the percent difference (standard error ,  or SE ,  at 5 yr ,  8.4 and 11.3 ,  respectively) .
The importance of the level of doses administered has been detailed in one of our previous reports. 4 A similar type of analysis was performed on patients entered into this study .
Myelosuppression represented the dose-limiting factor in the large majority of patients (70%-80%) ,  but severe leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia were rare (10%) ,  and prolonged myelosuppression beyond the fourth week from drug discontinuation was never observed .
Only a small subgroup of 22 patients (4.8%) refused to complete the planned program ,  and this was essentially due to negative psychologic reasons since these patients objected to being on a heavy and toxic treatment program (drug injections and timing of follow-up) without having visible disease .
In one patient of the 6-cycle group ,  endometrial carcinoma in situ was documented within 16 mo from mastectomy ,  3 patients in the 12-cycle group developed endometrial carcinoma ,  thyroid cancer ,  and myoblastoma ,  respectively ,  and in all patients second neoplasms were diagnosed between 46 and 49 mo from mastectomy .
The observation that in some patient subsets 6 cycles of CMF yielded apparently superior results to 12 cycles is probably related to the relative number of patients in each group and to the different median follow-up in postmenopausal women  whose accrual was discontinued in December 1976 .
Present clinical findings (Table 4) would indeed substantiate the above-mentioned statement ,  since no difference was detected when the three different dose levels were analyzed within the two treatment groups .
Another important finding to be considered is the pattern of new disease manifestations where no differencein the frequency of local-regional and/or distant areas was evident between the two treatment groups .
Thus ,  all above reported findings strongly support our preliminary 3-yr results and indicate that utilizing a single multidrug regimen ,  it is possible to reduce the duration of adjuvant treatment in operable breast cancer without compromising the therapeutic results .
It appears evident that ,  (A) the two series given 12 cycles of CMF achieved the same results ,  (B) the data reported in the three series treated with CMF are almost equivalent ,  (C) adjuvant CMF ,  whether administered for 12 or 6 cycles ,  was able to alter the course of operable breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes compared to the group subjected to radical mastectomy alone .
We had previously reported4 that the different results observed in our first adjuvant program were probably due to the low-dose CMF started in 31 of 104 postmenopausal patients (30%) because of elderly age .
The findings supporting evidence of a therapeutic efficacy of adjuvant combination chemotherapy in postmenopausal patients can also be found in the results reported by other investigators who have never observed that menopausal status affected treatment outcome .
More recently ,  the Guy's Hospital and Manchester study groups reported the actuarial 5-yr RFS of a randomized study comparing radical mastectomy alone versus melphalan versus CMF and showed that the only group significantly improved by adjuvant CMF was that of postmenopausal women ,  while premenopausal patients had findings that were superimposable in all three treatment groups .
In spite of initial controversial findings ,  recent retrospective studies carried out in advanced breast cancer have consistently shown lack of significant correlation between ER status and response rate to cytotoxic chemotherapy .
Patterns of first treatment failure were not different in the two series and ,  regardless of treatment instituted upon relapse ,  frequency of objective remissions were similar between the two groups followed by short-lived remissions in ER - tumors ,  while ER + tumors tended to show slow growing disease .
The most important practical aspect of our current study is at which point a single drug combination has provided all the benefit possible ,  i.e. ,  maximal tumor cytoreduction ,  in the majority of patients .
Through the analysis of our results in advanced breast cancer treated with CMF ,  Skipper came to the conclusion that in clinically metastatic disease the nadir in surviving tumor cells is probably reached in the majority of patients in less than 6 cycles .
Moreover ,  a less protracted exposure to cytotoxic regimens ,  including alkylating agents and adriamycin ,  could decrease the potential risk of delayed morbidity ,  namely cancerogenesis and chronic organ damage .
The reason(s) why RFS was not improved by prolonging chemotherapy once pathologic complete remission has been achieved ,  in our own trial and in other adjuvant trials for breast cancer ,  as well as in a variety of neoplastic diseases ,  can now be interpreted by considering the problem of specifically multidrug-resistant phenotypes .
Repetitive dose treatments either eradicate all or the vast majority of drug-sensitive neoplastic cells or hold them in check ,  leaving fluctuating and sometimes larger numbers of drug-resistant cells .
In our optimal kinetic situation ,  cyclic or sequential delivery of equally effective and non-cross-resistant drugs often will prevent or delay failures due to overgrowth of drug-resistant sublines of neoplastic cells ,  as recently demonstrated in advanced Hodgkin's disease .
Furthermore ,  to insure full drug doses in the new protocols ,  we have modified the CMF regimen and all three drugs are administered intravenously every 3 wk (CTX and FU 600 mg/sq m ,  MTX 40 mg/sq m) .
In the presence of myelosuppression(leukocytes < 3800/cu mm and/or platelets < 100,000/cu mm) on day 22 ,  treatment is delayed 1-2 wk to allow a constant delivery of full doses .
Only long-term analysis will answer the questions of whether the addition of adjuvant hormone therapy to chemotherapy will improve the results in ER + tumors and whether the excellent results reported by the M D Anderson Hospital with FAC (fluorouracil ,  adriamycin ,  cyclophosphamide) in women with > 4 axillary nodes 7 will be reproducible .
At present ,  tumor cell burden in the axilla appears to consistently represent an important prognostic factor ,  even in the presence of full dose chemotherapy ,  while new prospective trials should explore the potential efficacy of multiple non-cross-resistant drug combinations delivered for a relatively short time .
