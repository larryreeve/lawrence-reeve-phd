Intestinal anastomosis has been successfully performed for more than 150 years using a variety of techniques ,  materials ,  and devices .
All adult patients requiring intestinal anastomosis at Denver Health Medical Center from September 1996 to September 1999 were considered eligible .
Patients were also excluded if the surgeon did not believe that either technique could be used because of technical concerns such as edema or scarring .
Opaque ,  sealed envelopes indicating the technique to be used were placed in the operating room and were drawn sequentially when the need for intestinal anastomosis became apparent .
Each bite included 4 to 6 mm of the seromuscular wall ,  the larger bites were used at the mesenteric border to ensure an adequate seal .
Calculations of the length of stay used the number of patients for the denominator .
Calculations of the cost of materials were based on the actual hospital costs for the suture material and the standardized utilization of suture material by the surgeons .
All procedures were performed by postgraduate year 3 to 5 residents from the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center assisted by an attending surgeon ,  or by the attending surgeons themselves .
The Fisher exact test and the Pearson chi-square test were used to analyze categorical data .
P < .05 was considered to indicate statistical significance .
For six patients who required more than one anastomosis ,  the same method was used for each anastomosis .
The groups were evenly matched by age ,  sex ,  diagnosis ,  and location of the anastomosis (Table 1) .
DISCUSSION .
Since then ,  the technique has remained essentially unchanged except for the evolution of suture material for the inner layer .
In the United States ,  the first mention of this technique was by Allen et al , 18 who presented their results with its use before the Texas Surgical Society in 1979 .
It was then popularized by a colon and rectal surgical group based in Houston ,  Texas .
The ultimate test of the suitability of a technique for intestinal anastomosis is its ability to heal without leakage .
Further ,  most of the anastomoses in this study were performed by residents ,  who were often unfamiliar with the technique or were performing their first intestinal anastomosis .
Another factor is related to the properties of a continuous monofilament plastic suture line .
The major weakness of the study is its relatively small sample size .
