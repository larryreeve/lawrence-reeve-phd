Radical external beam plus intracavitary radiation continues to be the standard therapy for advanced cervical cancer to which all new therapies must be compared .
These include modifications of radiation treatment volume or fractionation including extended field radiation ,  hyperfractionated RT ,  strategies to overcome the negative impact of tumor hypoxia such as hyperbaric oxygen ,  or hypoxic cell radiation sensitizers .
These advantages include no delay in the start of definitive irradiation ,  no prolongation of overall treatment time (thus minimizing the theoretical risk of accelerated clonogen proliferation during the antineoplastic course) ,  and possible interaction of the concurrently administered chemotherapy with radiation through such mechanisms as inhibition of repair of radiation damage ,  cell synchronization ,  recruitment of nonproliferating cells into cell cycle ,  and reduction of the hypoxic fraction .
Last ,  it is unlikely that concurrent chemotherapy usually given as only one or two doses would significantly reduce established distant micrometastases .
While these studies suggested some benefit for patients with FIGO stage IIIB cancer ,  methodological problems in the study have not resulted in wide acceptance of the conclusion of benefit from concurrent hydroxyurea and its concurrent use has not entered standard practice .
The optimal dosing schedule for maximizing cell kill with infusional 5-FU and radiation remains undefined ,  but laboratory data suggested greater effects with increasing dose and prolonged exposure to 5-FU and when drug was present for intervals in excess of 48 h after radiation .
Patients were randomized to receive either (a) standard external beam pelvic irradiation (EBRT) in a dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions defined at 100% versus ,  (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional intravenous 5-FU in a dose of 1 g/m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  (c) partially hyperfractionated RT ,  5280 cGy in 33 fractions ,  2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  or (d) arm (c) with the same infusional 5-FU .
A posterior midline attenuator of two half value layers ,  3 cm in width at the midplane of the pelvis was used to reduce the dose to the bladder and rectum .
Appropriate guidelines for 5-FU dosage reduction or elimination were recommended for hematologic or mucosal toxicity ,  but RT interruptions were not .
Additionally ,  the changed fractionation scheme with delivery of two fractions daily at the beginning and end of therapy was designed to maximize the potential for interaction between 5-FU and radiation and to potentially reduce complication rates .
In order to detect an improvement of 15% in survival in arms (c) and (d) compared to that seen in arms (a) and (b) ,  assuming a 40% cause-specific survival rate in arm (a) and an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.2 ,  the total number of patients required was 272 .
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate median follow-up duration ,  censoring patients who died .
Severe late or chronic bowel symptoms were those of fistula ,  perforation ,  stricture ,  or obstruction requiring hospitalization or surgery and bleeding requiring transfusion .
Cytopenias were classed as grade 3 if bleeding or infection/fever occurred due to low blood counts and grade 2 if neutrophils were less than 1000 units/L or platelets less than 50,000 units/L .
For strata 1 and 2 the distribution of FIGO stage ,  tumor size ,  nodal involvement on lymphography ,  tumor grade ,  and capillary lymphatic space involvement (CLS) for each treatment are shown in Tables 1 and 2 .
One hundred and ninety of 221 patients received external beam radiation using the box technique ,  while 31 were treated with a parallel pair .
Since significant differences in pelvic control and survival were observed in stratum 1 which contained only 99 patients ,  it is important to examine whether there was an uneven distribution of other possible patient or tumor-related prognostic factors across the treatment arms to account for the differences observed .
To reach the conclusion that concurrent chemotherapy truly adds benefit to results achievable with radiation alone ,  it is important that the radiation be delivered in an optimal manner with adequate doses at ‘‘Point A’’ (80 to 90 Gy) and limited overall treatment times .
However ,  given the observation of a consistent trend in favor of standard RT plus 5-FU it was felt justified to perform an exploratory subset analysis of each stratum .
However ,  in stratum 1 constituted of patients with stage IB/IIA and those IIB tumors with medial parametrial involvement ,  a significant improvement in both pelvic control and disease-free survival in favor of standard radiation with concurrent 5-FU was observed (Figs. 5 and 6) .
The tumor- and patient-related factors examined were FIGO stage (IB versus IIA versus IIB) ,  size of tumor (greater or less than 6 cm and greater or less than 7 cm) ,  grade of tumor the presence or absence of capillary-like space involvement ,  nodal involvement ,  and patient age as a continuous variable .
