After radical mastectomy ,  eligible patients were prospectively randomized to receive either no further treatment or 12 monthly cycles of adjuvant CMF .
These results ,  as well as those reported in similar studies ,  suggest that the multimodality approach with cyclical combination chemotherapy is indeed an important advance in the strategy of primary management of resectable breast cancer ,  and therefore it is worthy of more widespread consideration .
The preliminary 3-yr results have shown that in premenopausal women ,  6 cycles of CMF yielded results that were identical to those obtained with 12 cycles .
This article presents the 5-yr results achieved in our study .
No postoperative radiotherapy or any other ancillary treatment was given .
At first relapse ,  treatment was uniform for both groups of women .
In the absence of symptoms ,  physical examination was performed once a month during the first year following mastectomy ,  then every 3 mo during the second and third years ,  and every 4-6 mo thereafter .
Chest roentgenogram as performed every 4 mo for the first year and semiannually thereafter ,  while bone x-rays were carried out twice a year .
The proportion of patients relapse-free or surviving are given for one point in time (5 yr) as derived from plots .
RESULTS .
Results as Function of Treatment Programs .
Table 1 details the results according to menopausal and nodal status .
It appears evident that treatment regimens were unable to significantly affect the RFS within each patient subset .
In postmenopausal women with more than 3 nodes ,  the difference between CMF 12 (34.4%) and CMF 6 (54.9% ,  p = 0.18) is only apparent since the confidence-limits throughout the curve totally blurred the percent difference (standard error ,  or SE ,  at 5 yr ,  8.4 and 11.3 ,  respectively) .
It is important to emphasize that overall no RFS difference was documented between preand postmenopausal patients (CMF 12 ,  59.3% versus 57.6% ,  CMF 6 ,  66.5% versus 63.1% , respectively) .
The somewhat contrasting results observed in the 6-cycle group in pre- and postmenopausal patients with 1-3 nodes (80.3% versus 66.1%) again reflect only a fictitious difference (SE ,  4.1 and 8.1 ,  respectively) .
Figure 2 shows the 5-yr total survival .
Again ,  no difference was observed in the two treatment groups .
In fact ,  premenopausal patients in the 12-cycle group had a 72% 5-yr survival compared to 77.1% for women in the 6-cycle group (p = 0.20) .
No difference in the pattern of treatment failure was evident between the treatment groups (Table 2) .
No substantial difference was also documented in the pattern of new disease manifestations ,  either local-regional or distant ,  between pre- and postmenopausal women .
Results as Function of ER status .
As can be seen ,  RFS was superior in patients with ER + tumors ,  but this difference failed to reach statistical significance in all patient subsets .
At present ,  this difference is somewhat difficult to explain .
In fact ,  there was no striking difference in the pattern of new disease manifestations between ER + and ER - tumors ,  since visceral involvement was documented in 31.2% and 35.3% ,  respectively ,  of relapsed patients .
Results as Function of Dose Levels of CMF .
Furthermore ,  within each dose level ,  there was no statistically significant difference between patients in the 12- or 6-cycle group .
In fact ,  confidence limits of the various series totally blurred the difference throughout the curves .
Thus ,  all above reported findings strongly support our preliminary 3-yr results and indicate that utilizing a single multidrug regimen ,  it is possible to reduce the duration of adjuvant treatment in operable breast cancer without compromising the therapeutic results .
Present results are in line with those reported in a similar study carried out at the Sidney Farber Cancer Institute .
The 5-yr results achieved in the first study are reported in Table 6 and compared with those obtained in the present series .
We had previously reported4 that the different results observed in our first adjuvant program were probably due to the low-dose CMF started in 31 of 104 postmenopausal patients (30%) because of elderly age .
Our results have been confirmed through different reports .
Also ,  the Arizona group utilizing a different combination regimen ,  i.e. ,  adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide ,  for about 6 mo achieved a 5-yr RFS that is very similar to that observed in ourstudies .
The 40-yr-old mutation theory of Luria and Delbruck developed for bacterial cells was recently adapted to cancer ,  i.e. ,  neoplastic cells mutate spontaneously to a state of specific resistance to a wide variety of anticancer drugs .
