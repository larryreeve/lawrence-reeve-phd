The aim of the first program was to evaluate whether CMF given after radical surgery was able to alter the course of the disease .
For this reason ,  in September 1975 ,  we started a new prospective study with the intent to evaluate the possibility of reducing the duration of adjuvant CMF without compromising the therapeutic effect of combined treatment .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Adjuvant chemotherapy was started within 2-4 wk from mastectomy .
Patient Population .
In fact ,  the retrospective evaluation of roentgenograms revealed the presence of distant metastases prior to radical mastectomy in 3 patients (CMF 12 ,  1 ,  CMF 6 ,  2) ,  while 4 additional women (CMF 12 ,  3 ,  CMF 6 ,  1) had fixation of the primary tumor to the underlying pectoral fascia or muscle (T3b) .
A total of 22 patients (premenopausal 12/324 or 4% ,  postmenopausal 9/135 or 7%) refused to complete the planned adjuvant program mainly because of negative psychologic reasons .
In the presence of controversial radiologic findings ,  examinations were performed more often than originally planned .
Primary treatment failure was defined as the first documented evidence of new disease manifestation(s) in either local-regional area(s) ,  distant site(s) ,  or a combination of the two .
Statistical Evaluation .
The proportion of patients relapse-free or surviving are given for one point in time (5 yr) as derived from plots .
Figure 1 shows that the comparative RFS at 5 yr was practically identical in the two treatment groups (CMF 12 ,  59% ,  CMF 6 ,  65.6% ,  p =0.17) .
It is important to emphasize that overall no RFS difference was documented between preand postmenopausal patients (CMF 12 ,  59.3% versus 57.6% ,  CMF 6 ,  66.5% versus 63.1% , respectively) .
The somewhat contrasting results observed in the 6-cycle group in pre- and postmenopausal patients with 1-3 nodes (80.3% versus 66.1%) again reflect only a fictitious difference (SE ,  4.1 and 8.1 ,  respectively) .
On the contrary ,  in both treatmentand menopausal groups ,  RFS was affected by the number of involved nodes (Table 1) .
Again ,  no difference was observed in the two treatment groups .
Site of First Relapse .
No difference in the pattern of treatment failure was evident between the treatment groups (Table 2) .
Table 3 details the findings observed at 5 yr from mastectomy .
As can be seen ,  RFS was superior in patients with ER + tumors ,  but this difference failed to reach statistical significance in all patient subsets .
Also ,  no difference was evident when overall survival of postmenopausal women was examined (ER+ 82.5% versus ER- 76.2% ,  p =0.32) .
In fact ,  there was no striking difference in the pattern of new disease manifestations between ER + and ER - tumors ,  since visceral involvement was documented in 31.2% and 35.3% ,  respectively ,  of relapsed patients .
Furthermore ,  within each dose level ,  there was no statistically significant difference between patients in the 12- or 6-cycle group .
Acute toxic reactions have been previously reported .
Nausea ,  vomiting ,  and hair loss were the most distressing side effects .
As can be seen ,  the relative frequency ranged between0.5% for the 6-cycle group and 1.7% for the control group of the previous series .
In fact ,  confidence limits of the various series totally blurred the difference throughout the curves .
Our data suggest that the main important pharmacologic factor affecting tumor response is the peak level of drugs administered and not their total amount .
It appears evident that ,  (A) the two series given 12 cycles of CMF achieved the same results ,  (B) the data reported in the three series treated with CMF are almost equivalent ,  (C) adjuvant CMF ,  whether administered for 12 or 6 cycles ,  was able to alter the course of operable breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes compared to the group subjected to radical mastectomy alone .
The first and most important one is that there appears to be no real difference following adjuvant chemotherapy ,  namely CMF ,  between the RFS of pre- versus postmenopausal women (CMF 12 ,  59.3% versus 57.6% ,  CMF 6 ,  66.5% versus 63.1% ,  respectively) .
At present ,  we have no clear explanation for this difference .
Through the analysis of our results in advanced breast cancer treated with CMF ,  Skipper came to the conclusion that in clinically metastatic disease the nadir in surviving tumor cells is probably reached in the majority of patients in less than 6 cycles .
This observation is indirectly supported by findings obtained at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center where 24 cycles of CMF were unable to obtain results superior to those achieved in our series .
Moreover ,  a less protracted exposure to cytotoxic regimens ,  including alkylating agents and adriamycin ,  could decrease the potential risk of delayed morbidity ,  namely cancerogenesis and chronic organ damage .
At present ,  tumor cell burden in the axilla appears to consistently represent an important prognostic factor ,  even in the presence of full dose chemotherapy ,  while new prospective trials should explore the potential efficacy of multiple non-cross-resistant drug combinations delivered for a relatively short time .
