TRIALS of postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer conducted during the 1960s and 1970s showed significant reductions in rates of locoregional recurrence but no improvement in overall survival .
Nevertheless ,  there are reasons to reconsider radiotherapy ,  including the limited value of adjuvant chemotherapy for bulky disease ,  a synergistic effect of chemotherapy plus radiation on residual locoregional tumor ,  and the possibility that eliminating bulky disease with radiation may improve the effect of chemotherapy ,  because chemotherapy may be more effective when the overall disease burden is low .
This report presents our findings after 15 years of follow-up .
METHODS .
The mastectomy was performed according to standard surgical practice between 1979 and 1986 .
Chemotherapy .
The chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (600 mg per square meter of body-surface area) ,  methotrexate (40 mg per square meter) ,  and fluorouracil (600 mg per square meter) (the CMF regimen) ,  given intravenously every 21 days as described by Bonadonna et al. ,  initially for 12 months (80 patients) ,  and in the case of patients randomized after 1981 ,  for 6 months .
Sixteen daily treatments were delivered over a period of three to four weeks .
The postmastectomy chest wall received a dose of 37.5 Gy through two tangential fields .
The mid-axilla received a dose of 35 Gy through an anterior supraclavicular–axillary field with a posterior axillary boost .
Also ,  as part of a second randomization ,  68 patients with estrogen-positive tumors were treated with radiationinduced ovarian ablation that included 20 Gy over a period of five days plus prednisone (7.5 mg per day) for two years ,  as described by Meakin et al. Among these 68 patients ,  33 were assigned to chemotherapy and 35 were assigned to chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
Two-sided P values of less than 0.05 were considered to represent statistical significance .
DISCUSSION .
There was no excess mortality we could attribute to the long-term side effects of radiotherapy .
The benefits of radiotherapy found in our study ,  but not in most earlier studies ,  merit comment .
A previous meta-analysis and several individual trials found that the latter was due to a substantial increase in mortality from cardiac causes .
Therefore ,  the metaanalyses of previous studies may not be relevant to current practice .
The routine use of radiation in all node-positive patients would represent a substantial shift in treatment for breast cancer .
The elimination of locoregional cancer cells by radiotherapy added to adjuvant chemotherapy may reduce mortality in selected patients with breast cancer .
