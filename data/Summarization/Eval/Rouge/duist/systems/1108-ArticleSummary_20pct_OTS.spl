Several phase 2 studies have reported that concomitant treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy results in faster and more complete responses and better survival than expected with radiotherapy alone .
All patients were scheduled to undergo external irradiation ,  intracavitary brachytherapy ,  and extrafascial hysterectomy ,  with half the patients randomly assigned to receive weekly intravenous infusions of cisplatin during the period of radiotherapy .
We estimated that 173 patients were needed in each treatment group in order to be able to detect a 40 percent decrease in the recurrence rate in the group given radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
Three of these patients had been randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone ,  and two had been assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin .
Thus ,  a total of 369 patients were evaluated ,  186 in the radiotherapy group and 183 in the combined-therapy group .
Pretreatment surgical evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes was optional and was performed in 13 patients (7 percent) assigned to radiotherapy alone and 14 patients (8 percent) assigned to radiotherapy and cisplatin .
One patient assigned to receive radiotherapy alone and two patients assigned to receive radiotherapy and cisplatin refused to undergo radiotherapy .
Extrafascial hysterectomy was performed after radiotherapy in 168 patients (90 percent) in the group given radiotherapy alone and 175 patients (96 percent) in the group given radiotherapy and cisplatin .
There were significantly more hysterectomy specimens without detectable cancer in the combined-therapy group than in the group given radiotherapy alone (52 percent vs. There were no treatment-related deaths ,  but 64 patients (35 percent) in the combined-therapy group had grade 3 (moderate) or grade 4 (severe) adverse effects ,  as compared with 25 patients (13 percent) in the group given radiotherapy alone .
The disease recurred in 69 patients in the group given radiotherapy alone (37 percent) and 38 patients given radiotherapy and cisplatin (21 percent) (Table 4) .
The relative risk of recurrence in the combined-therapy group as compared with the group given radiotherapy alone was 0.51 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.34 to 0.75) .
Forty-nine of the patients in the group given radiotherapy alone died of cervical cancer (26 percent) ,  as compared with 27 of the patients in the group given radiotherapy and cisplatin (15 percent) (Table 4) .
The relative risk of death in the combined-therapy group as compared with the group given radiotherapy alone was 0.54 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.34 to 0.86) .
The threeyear survival rates were 74 percent in the group given radiotherapy alone and 83 percent in the combined-therapy group (P=0.008 by the log-rank test) (Fig.  This controversy stimulated an earlier Gynecologic Oncology Group trial in which patients were randomly assigned to undergo either hysterectomy after radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone (unpublished data) .
Therefore ,  we chose to test the value of concurrent treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy followed by hysterectomy as compared with that of radiotherapy alone followed by hysterectomy .
The effect of these two drugs in combination with radiotherapy was compared with the effect of hydroxyurea and radiotherapy in a randomized phase 3 trial by the Gynecologic Oncology Group involving patients with cervical cancer of stages IIB through IVA (unpublished data) .
The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group study ,  whose results appear elsewhere in this issue of the Journal ,  compared pelvic and para-aortic radiotherapy with pelvic radiotherapy in  combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil in patients with clinical stage IB through IVA cervical cancer .
The Southwest Oncology Group study compared pelvic radiotherapy alone with pelvic radiotherapy in combination with fluorouracil and cisplatin in high-risk patients  with involvement of lymph nodes or surgical margins who had undergone radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer stage IA2 ,  IB ,  or IIA (unpublished data) .
The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment ,  but they share a common result: all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin .
