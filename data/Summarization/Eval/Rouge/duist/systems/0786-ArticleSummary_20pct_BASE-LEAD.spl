RECURRENCE OF rectal cancer in the pelvis after a complete resection represents a major contributor to morbidity and subsequent mortality .
Preoperative and postoperative radiation therapy alone ,  while reducing the local recurrence rate ,  has not been shown to improve survival .
In 1985 ,  the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG ,  study GI 7175) reported that postoperative radiation and chemotherapy reduced the tumor recurrence rate for patients who had undergone a curative resection for rectal adenocarcinoma .
Treatment was limited to patients with tumors penetrating the full thickness of the rectal wall or with metastasis to regional lymph nodes .
Although the superiority of combination radiotherapy and chemotherapy with fluorouracil(5-FU) and semustine (MeCCNU) was clearly shown in terms of both disease-free survival and ,  subsequently , overall survival ,  the clinical impact of such treatment was tempered by the inclusion of MeCCNU in an adjuvant setting .
The leukemogenic effect of MeCCNU was established subsequent to the initiation of GI 7175 ,  indeed ,  one patient who participated in GI 7175 developed acute myeloid leukemia after MeCCNU therapy .
Consequently ,  the GITSG sought to assess the contribution of MeCCNU to the combined modality regimen in study GI 7180 .
The results of that study are the focus of this report .
A two-arm study was designed using the initial radiation/chemotherapy program of the previous study (GI 7175) for both arms of the new study (GI 7180) but to offering MeCCNU to only half the patients during the postradiation period .
The same postradiation regimen of 5-FU and MeCCNU as that used in GI 7175 was chosen for one arm ,  with the exception that the duration of treatment with postradiation 5-FU and MeCCNU was reduced from 18 months to 12 months in an attempt to reduce the leukemogenic potential of the MeCCNU .
An escalating single-agent 5-FU regimen incorporating a theoretical maximum-tolerated dose was chosen as the alternative treatment option based on clinical evidence suggesting a dose response curve for 5-FU and pilot data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggesting added efficacy of 5-FU when given at higher dose levels .
PATIENTS AND METHODS .
Eligibility and Exclusion Criteria .
Patients were considered eligible for entry onto the study provided they had histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum and had undergone a surgical procedure at which time all gross tumor had been removed and no evidence of tumor had been present at the resection margins .
The distal edge of the primary tumor must have been <= 12 cm from the anal verge as measured by sigmoidoscopy with the patient in the knee-chest position .
Patients must have recovered from the acute effects of surgery ,  been capable of starting treatment within 60 days after resection ,  had no evidence of active infection ,  had adequate performance and nutritional status to tolerate protocol treatment ,  and had no preexisting or concurrent malignant tumors except basal cell or superficial squamous cell carcinomas of the skin .
Presence of ascites ,  peritoneal seeding ,  residual pelvic tumor ,  positive paraaortic lymph node biopsy ,  or distant metastases excluded patients from study ,  as did previous chemotherapy or pelvic irradiation or any active and significant coexistent disease that ,  in the judgment of the investigator ,  would make the risks of chemotherapy or radiation therapy prohibitive .
Only patients with Dukes pathologic stage B2 (negative nodes ,  disease extension into the perirectal fat) ,  C1 (positive nodes ,  no disease extension into the perirectal fat) ,  and C2 ,  (positive nodes ,  disease extension into the perirectal fat) were eligible ,  and slides must have been available for review .
Normal hepatic ,  renal ,  and bone marrow function (ie ,  bilirubin level < 2.5 mg/dL ,  BUN level< 25 mg/dL ,  or creatinine level < 1.5 mg/dL ,  leukocyte and platelet counts > 4,500/uL and 125,000/uL ,  respectively) must have been documented before study entry .
Randomization .
Patients considered eligible received a full explanation of the purpose ,  procedures ,  and risks of the study ,  signed a statement of informed consent approved by the local institutional review board ,  and were then randomized by telephoning a central coordinating center .
Random assignment to treatment was performed by the coordinating center after confirmation of eligibility criteria using a preestablished randomization table .
Radiation Therapy .
Supervoltage radiation therapy with the treatment volume to encompass the true and false pelvis was specified by the study protocol .
The superior border of the field was to be the top of the fifth lumbar vertebral body ,  the lateral border 2 cm lateral to the true pelvic side wall ,  and the inferior margin of the field was to be determined clinically .
The inferior margin included the perineumin all patients who underwent an abdominal-perineal resection and whose tumor was <= 5 cm from the dentate line .
Parallel-opposed three- or four-field techniques were allowed .
For all other patients ,  inclusion of the perineum in the radiation field was at the discretion of the investigator .
In cases of perineal exclusion ,  the inferior margin of the field must have included the lower margin of the ischial tuberosity .
The treatment volume as defined must have received 4,140 cGy at a rate of 180 cGy/d ,  five treatments per week .
Chemotherapy .
All patients were to receive intravenous 5-FU 500 mg/m given in a rapid infusion on the first 3 days and last 3 days of radiation therapy .
After the completion of radiation therapy and 5-FU ,  nochemotherapy was given for 5 weeks .
After this 5-week period ,  patients received one of the two chemotherapy schedules .
5-FU and MeCCNU .
The first course on this treatment arm consisted of intravenous 5-FU 300 mg/m2  ,  days 1 to 5 and 375mg/m ,  days 36 to 40 given in a rapid infusion .
One dose of MeCCNU 100 mg/m was to be given orally on day 1 .
