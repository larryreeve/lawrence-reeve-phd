While surgery and radiotherapy (RT) are equally effective in early-stage disease ,  radiation  therapy has been the primary treatment modality for stage III disease ,  with 5-year survival rates between 30% to 45% being  reported.4-8 Attempts to improve these results ,  including the use of hypoxic cell sensitizers ,  hyperbaric oxygen therapy , '0  and neutron therapy" have met with limited or no success .
Vogl et al and Alberts et al using a combination of bleomycin ,  vincristine ,   mitomycin ,  and cisplatin (BOMP) in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent disease reported high response rates (> 20% of  the patients with a complete response [CR]) with acceptable toxicity .
The use of upfront CT as  initial treatment before pelvic RT would be theoretically advantageous as the vascular supply to the tumor is not  compromised ,  allowing a higher local tissue concentration of drugs ,  thereby improving the effectiveness of CT .
To test this  hypothesis ,  we began in 1984 at the Instituto Nacional de Cancer (Rio de Janeiro ,  Brazil) a prospective randomized trial  comparing neoadjuvant BOMP CT followed by pelvic RT (CT + RT) versus pelvic RT alone in patients with stage IIIB carcinoma of  the cervix .
Fifty-two patients were randomized to the CT + RT arm and 55 to the RT arm .
In  the CT + RT group ,  11 refused further therapy ,  including pelvic RT ,  after only one cycle of CT ,  and two others were found to  have abnormal renal function after randomization and before commencement of treatment .
Thus ,  there were 39 assessable patients in the CT + RT  arm and 52 in the RT arm .
Chemotherapy consisted of bleomycin 15 U intramuscularly (IM) every 12 hours from days 1 to 4 (total dose ,  120 U) ,   vincristine 1 mg/m2 IV on day 1 ,  mitomycin 10 mg/im 2 IV on day 1 ,  and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1 ,  given on an outpatient  basis every 3 weeks for three cycles .
Six months after activation of the study ,  after nine patients had been treated with CT ,  the bleomycin dose was reduced to 15  U IM every 12 hours from day 1 to day 3 (total dose ,  90 U) ,  and after the first year ,  cisplatin administration was changed  from day 1 to day 4 .
A CR was defined as the complete resolution of all  measurable disease and symptoms ,  a partial response (PR) was defined as a 50% or more decrease in the sum of the products of  perpendicular diameters of measurable disease ,  and stable disease (SD) was defined as less than a 50% decrease in the sum of  the products of perpendicular diameters of the measurable lesions .
Only supportive palliative treatment was given to relapsing patients ,  and CT was  not used as a salvage treatment for the patients in the RT-only arm .
We planned to accrue 60 patients into each treatment arm ,  which would produce a power of 80%  and detect an improvement of 25 % in survival with the combined modality treatment at the a = 0.05 level (two-sided test) .
Seven patients were not included in response assessment in the combined modality group ,  four patients who died  of CT complications ,  two who died of metastatic disease ,  all of them before commencement of RT ,  and one other patient whosepelvic disease progressed during CT and who received palliative irradiation only because of poor general condition .
For the partial responders ,  57% in the RT arm and 37.5% in the CT + RT are alive with no evidence of  disease progression at a minimum follow-up time of 3 years .
These numbers are similar to those patients who were felt to have  obtained a CR ,  only 59% (10 of 17) and 40% (six of 15) are still alive in the RT and CT + RT groups ,  respectively .
As of December 1989 ,  31 of the 52 patients in the RT group and 30 of 39 in the CT + RT had died .
It was 39% and 23% for patients randomized to RT and CT + RT ,  respectively (P  = .02 by the log-rank test) .
The 5-year  survival rates for the complete responders were 57% and 36% for the RT and CT + RT groups ,  respectively .
There was also no  difference in the incidence of distant disease between RT and CT + RT (20% v18.5%) .
After two bleomycin-related lung deaths (two of nine treated patients) ,  the  bleomycin dose was reduced from 30 U daily for 4 days to 30 U daily for 3 days .
In spite of this ,  two further patients  experienced a similar complication (two of 18 treated patients) .
The cisplatin treatment day was then changed from day 1 to  day 4 but yet another patient developed the same problem (one of 12 treated patients) .
Diarrhea was the main complication of pelvic  irradiation ,  seen in eight patients (15.5%) on RT and 11 (34%) on CT + RT .
One patient in the RT group who had grade 3 cystitis ,  characterized by  frequent hematuria ,  presented to the emergency room 19 months following completion of pelvic RT with gross hematuria with  clots .
Except for two patients ,  all others had received previous treatment (CT in two ,  pelvic RT in 11 ,  and major  surgery in three) .
The rationale for the use of neoadjuvant CT23 is that (1) the blood supply to the tumor is not compromised by previous  radiotherapy or surgery allowing for better drug distribution into the tumor ,  (2) patients' tolerance to CT may be enhanced  as performance status and marrow reserve are unaltered by previous treatment ,  (3) decreasing the bulkiness of the primary  disease would improve the effectiveness of the local RT ,  (4) there is the possibility of eradication of subclinical  metastases ,  and (5) theoretically a tumor may be more chemosensitive before surgery or RT .
Although 25.5% of the patients achieved a CR following three cycles of BOMP and 47% of the CT + RT group obtained a CR at the  end of RT ,  the 5-year overall survival was significantly inferior in the CT + RT group than in the control arm (39% v 21% ,  P  = .02) .
It cannot be accounted for by patient  selection as both groups were well balanced for the wellknown prognostic factors in stage III carcinoma of the cervix.4'24-27  More importantly ,  all patients in the CT + RT arm completed pelvic RT ,  as defined by the protocol guidelines ,  and therefore ,   inadequate irradiation dosage cannot explain the poorer results .
Since repopulation by surviving tumor clonogens is not  a specific response to RT but rather results from killing of tumor cells ,  these authors have suggested that CT ,  which is  effective in killing cells ,  could also lead to an accelerated regrowth of surviving clonogens ,  lessening the effect of  subsequent RT .
Similarly ,  in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ,  upfront CT has produced impressive response rates ,  but again ,   this has not led to an improvement in survival rates over those achieved with RT alone .
The lung toxicity experienced by patients in the CT + RT group is unacceptable .
Recently ,  Chambers et al also reported a high incidence of pulmonary toxicity in patients receiving BOMP CT for gynecologic  squamous cell carcinoma .
These authors treated 23 patients (20 cervical cancer ,  two vulvar ,  one ovarian) and observed the  development of pulmonary toxicity in eight patients (34.5%) ,  with five of them dying a respiratory death while free of  disease .
