However ,  many drawbacks still exist regarding themethod of RT delivery as well as the toxicity of combinationadjuvant chemotherapy .
The aim of this trial is to assess the effectiveness and toxicityof adjuvant post-operative RT vs combined RT and CT(5-FU plus levamisole) in patients with TNM stage II-IIIresectable rectal cancer (pT3-4 ,  pN0 ,  M0 ,  pTl-4 ,  pNl-3 , M0) .
The primary endpoint is overall survival ,  secondaryendpoints are disease-free survival ,  rate of loco-regionalrecurrence ,  and treatment-related toxicity/morbidity .
Dosage schedule .
Preliminary results .
No significant differences as regards sex ,  age ,  performance states ,  type of operation (sphincter-saving resection or abdominoperineal excision of the rectum) ,  pT ,  pN stages of disease ,  number of sampled lymph-nodes ,  and grading were observed in 76 and 73 patients randomized in Arms I and II ,  respectively .
