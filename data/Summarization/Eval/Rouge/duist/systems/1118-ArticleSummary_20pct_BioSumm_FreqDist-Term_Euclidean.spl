INTRODUCTION .
However ,  most series were nonrandomized and failed to achieve an improvement in long-term survival .
Therefore ,  to further test the hypothesis ,  a definitive statement about the optimal management in this situation required a prospective ,  randomized trial .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Trial Design .
Patients .
Adequate hepatic ,  renal ,  and cardiopulmonary functions were essential .
Extraperitoneal staging laparotomy was performed if aspiration cytology was negative .
A dose of 4400 cGy was delivered in 22 equal fractions over 30 to 35 days .
Flexible granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 2 mg/kg/day administration was used to prevent neutropenia and further infection .
Chemotherapy was to be delayed week by week until the neutrophil count recovered to ú1500/ml ,  platelet count recovered to ú100,000/ml .
Cisplatin was to be delayed if serum creatinine levels did not return to 1.5 mg/dl ,  and creatinine clearance to 60 ml/min .
All adverse effects and laboratory abnormalities for chemotherapy were graded according to the toxicity criteria of the Gynecologic Oncology Group .
Toxicity of chemotherapy was assessed before each course .
Study End Point .
Statistical Considerations .
Comparisons of variables between groups were based on the x2 test .
RESULTS .
Among them ,  60 patients were randomized to the concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy ,  62 were randomized to the radiotherapy alone .
Among them ,  interrupted radiotherapy with delayed treatment because of treatment-related toxicity was observed in 9 cases .
Toxicity .
No treatment-related deaths occurred in the radiotherapy group .
Failure Patterns .
DISCUSSION .
In theory ,  bulky tumors have significant hypoxic cell populations that are relatively radioresistant .
However ,  most of these results were nonrandomized and were based on a small sample size .
The pelvis is still the predominant site of failure in around 30% .
This finding has been associated with occult extrapelvic disease .
Indeed ,  in our trial ,  the treatment-related toxicity was severe and resulted in delayed radiotherapy in 15% of patients after chemoradiotherapy ,  in which 77.8% of patients with treatment delays recurred or died of disease .
Chemotherapy could also lead to an accelerated regrowth of surviving clonogens .
Such trials are currently underway .
