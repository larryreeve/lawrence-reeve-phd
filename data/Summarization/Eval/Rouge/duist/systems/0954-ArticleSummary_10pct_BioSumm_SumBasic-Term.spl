From 1979 through 1986 ,  318 premenopausal women with newly diagnosed stage I or II breast cancer were enrolled in the study after undergoing modified radical mastectomy if ,  after axillary-node dissection ,  one or more level I or II lymph nodes were found to be positive on pathological examination .
After written informed consent was obtained ,  the patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups ,  those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy plus locoregional radiotherapy in five fields (the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group ,  with 164 patients) and those receiving chemotherapy alone (the chemotherapy group ,  with 154 patients) .
The chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (600 mg per square meter of body-surface area) ,  methotrexate (40 mg per square meter) ,  and fluorouracil (600 mg per square meter) (the CMF regimen) ,  given intravenously every 21 days as described by Bonadonna et al. ,  initially for 12 months (80 patients) ,  and in the case of patients randomized after 1981 ,  for 6 months .
Also ,  as part of a second randomization ,  68 patients with estrogen-positive tumors were treated with radiationinduced ovarian ablation that included 20 Gy over a period of five days plus prednisone (7.5 mg per day) for two years ,  as described by Meakin et al. Among these 68 patients ,  33 were assigned to chemotherapy and 35 were assigned to chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
In the various analyses ,  we studied the following end points ,  any relapse of breast cancer (or death without a known relapse of breast cancer) ,  for the analysis of disease-free survival ,  locoregional recurrence as a first event ,  before a systemic recurrence (in the ipsilateral chest wall or an axillary ,  internal mammary ,  or supraclavicular node) ,  for the analysis of survival free of locoregional disease ,  any systemic relapse ,  with or without a locoregional relapse (or death without a known systemic relapse) ,  for the analysis of survival free of systemic disease ,  death from breast cancer ,  for the analysis of breast-cancer–specific survival ,  and any death ,  for the analysis of overall survival .
There was an overall reduction of 34 percent in the rate of systemic recurrence (relative risk ,  0.66 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.49 to 0.89 ,  P 0.006) in the group treated with combined therapy (75 of 164 patients vs. 94 of 154 patients in the group treated only with chemotherapy) ,  and a 17-percentage-point improvement in systemic disease-free survival (Fig. 2) .
Our trial did not stratify the patients according to nodal status ,  but a test for interaction showed no significant difference in the magnitude of the benefit from radiotherapy between the subgroup with three or fewer positive nodes and the subgroup with four or more positive nodes .
It is possible that we will see additional benefit in overall survival ,  because at this writing 19 patients in the chemotherapy group remain alive with systemic recurrence ,  as compared with only 9 in the combined-treatment group ,  most of these 28 patients are expected to die of breast cancer .
The meta-analysis performed by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group , 1 which analyzed all the randomized radiation trials begun before 1985 ,  found a 67 percent reduction in rates of locoregional relapse (P 0.001) and a 6 percent reduction in mortality from breast cancer (P 0.03) ,  but no improvement in overall survival .
Locoregional radiation is not routinely used atpresent in patients with node-positive breast cancer ,  although it is coming into use to treat patients with 10 or more positive nodes and occasionally those with 4 or more positive nodes .
