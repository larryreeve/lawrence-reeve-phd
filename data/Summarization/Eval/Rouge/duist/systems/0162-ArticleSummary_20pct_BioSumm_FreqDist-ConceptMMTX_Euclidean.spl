SINCE JUNE 1973 ,  the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of CMF (cyclophosphamide ,  methotrexate ,  and fluorouracil) chemotherapy were evaluated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes .
The 7-yr results of this first program are now available , 6 and they confirm the benefit of CMFtreated patients (RFS 49.2%) as compared to women subjected to radical mastectomy alone (RFS 35.8% ,  p < 0.002) .
Among the numerous questions to be answered by current adjuvant studies is the optimal duration of treatment .
For this reason ,  in September 1975 ,  we started a new prospective study with the intent to evaluate the possibility of reducing the duration of adjuvant CMF without compromising the therapeutic effect of combined treatment .
Similar findings were reported in the 4-yr analysis for the total patient population .
The technique of block randomization (permuted block of length 4 for 2 regimens) was utilized .
Based on the 3-yr analysis of our first CMF study showing an apparent lack of therapeutic advantage following adjuvant chemotherapy in postmenopausal women ,  randomization for this group of patients was discontinued at the end of November 1976 .
All patients were subjected to either Halsted or modified radical mastectomy ,  but a small fraction (16%) was subjected to extended radical mastectomy .
Adjuvant chemotherapy was started within 2-4 wk from mastectomy .
The majority of our patients (62%) had less than 3 nodes involved ,  and in half of the women tumors ranged between 2 and 5 cm on pathologic measurement .
Details on baseline studies and follow-up program were as previously reported , 1 ,  2 and they can be summarized as follows .
Liver scan and mammography of residual breast were done once a year .
In the presence of controversial radiologic findings ,  examinations were performed more often than originally planned .
In the present series ,  baseline and routine bone scans were systematically performed in about half of patients .
Statistical Evaluation .
Probabilities represent comparison of the entire plots ,  computed by use of the productlimit method ,  and were calculated using the log-rank test and values of significance .
In postmenopausal women with more than 3 nodes ,  the difference between CMF 12 (34.4%) and CMF 6 (54.9% ,  p = 0.18) is only apparent since the confidence-limits throughout the curve totally blurred the percent difference (standard error ,  or SE ,  at 5 yr ,  8.4 and 11.3 ,  respectively) .
Site of First Relapse .
The incidence of contralateral breast involvement alone ,  which in our series has always been considered as primary treatment failure ,  was 2.5% versus 2.3% .
Table 3 details the findings observed at 5 yr from mastectomy .
The importance of the level of doses administered has been detailed in one of our previous reports. 4 A similar type of analysis was performed on patients entered into this study .
Acute toxic reactions have been previously reported .
No hematologic or infectious complications from repeated episodes of myelosuppression were documented ,  and no evidence of liver damage attributable to prolonged administration of methotrexate was detected .
As already reported (Table 2) ,  contralateral breast cancer was documented in a total of 11 patients (CMF 12 ,  6 ,  CMF 6 ,  5) .
DISCUSSION .
In fact ,  in all variables examined ,  none of the two treatments under evaluation was significantly different from the other .
Other considerations of practical importance can also be derived from our current findings .
Thus ,  in the present study ,  only a small fraction of patients was started on drug doses that once more proved to be therapeutically ineffective .
A trend favoring postmenopausal versus premenopausal women given adjuvant combination chemotherapy was also observed by the NSABP group .
Effective adjuvant combination chemotherapy seems to be unaffected by ER status ,  at least when RFS is considered .
In spite of initial controversial findings ,  recent retrospective studies carried out in advanced breast cancer have consistently shown lack of significant correlation between ER status and response rate to cytotoxic chemotherapy .
At present ,  we have no clear explanation for this difference .
Through the analysis of our results in advanced breast cancer treated with CMF ,  Skipper came to the conclusion that in clinically metastatic disease the nadir in surviving tumor cells is probably reached in the majority of patients in less than 6 cycles .
Briefly ,  all classes of drugs select and allow overgrowth of specifically drug-resistant neoplastic cells .
Eventually ,  and regardless of prolonged chemotherapy ,  the resistant neoplastic cells overgrow ,  become clinically evident ,  and kill the host .
