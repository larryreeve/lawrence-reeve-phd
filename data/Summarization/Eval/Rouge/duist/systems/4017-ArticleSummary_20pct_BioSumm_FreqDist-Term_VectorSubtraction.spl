Introduction .
Survival time in these patients is typically short .
These regimens were selected for first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer ,  based on promising antitumour efficacy and an acceptable safety profile .
Methods .
Patients .
Patients with the following criteria were not eligible ,  central-nervous-system metastasis ,  unresolved bowel obstruction or diarrhoea ,  and known contraindications to fluorouracil (angina pectoris ,  myocardial infarction in the past 6 months) .
Study design .
Further cancer treatment was also recorded .
Our primary endpoint was response rate .
We also assessed quality of life .
Statistical analysis .
For continuous variables ,  we used Student's t tests .
We did log-rank tests stratified by this variable .
Multivariate analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population .
We used log-rank tests to compare the two groups .
Results .
Patients and treatment .
Efficacy .
In the intention-to-treat analysis of the 2weekly regimen ,  the response rate was ,  for the irinotecan and 11.4 (5.3-29.6) weeks in the no-irinotecan group .
The log-rank test was significant (p=0.0098) .
The interaction between treatment and regimen was not significant .
The interaction between treatment and regimen was not significant .
The median time to treatment failure was 5.3 (0.4-15.7+) months in the irinotecan group and 3.8 (0.4-11.5+) months in the no-irinotecan group (p=0.0014) .
Safety .
Quality of life .
1161 questionnaires were obtained from the 385 patients in the intention-to-treat population .
The rate of return was similar in the two treatment groups.62% in the irinotecan group and 59% in the no-irinotecan group .
QL did not differ significantly between groups .
The same trend was seen with the second imputation method .
Discussion .
Those studies did not ,  however ,  show survival benefits .
