CERVICAL cancer is the second most frequent cancer among women worldwide and the most frequent cancer among women in Africa ,  Asia ,  and South America .
The ability of radiotherapy to cure locally advanced cervical cancer is limited by the size of the tumor ,  because the doses required to treat large tumors exceed the limit of toxicity in normal tissue .
Efforts to overcome this problem have included the use of large-particle radiotherapy ,  the use of different radiation-fractionation schedules ,  and the concurrent use of hyperthermia or chemotherapy .
However ,  treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and radiotherapy resulted in greater improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival than did treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy (Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) .
At the time we were developing the protocol used in the current study ,  radiotherapy plus concomitant chemotherapy with hydroxyurea was the standard combined-therapy regimen for advanced cervical cancer ,  because an early analysis of the combination of radiation ,  cisplatin ,  and fluorouracil failed to show improved progression-free survival .
In our study ,  to improve the efficacy of the cisplatin and fluorouracil combination ,  we added hydroxyurea to the regimen ,  because of evidence that this drug inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and depletes tumor cells of deoxyuridine monophosphate .
Therefore ,  we undertook a randomized study in which all women with locally advanced cervical cancer received local radiation as well as weekly concomitant treatment with cisplatin alone ,  the combination of cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  or hydroxyurea alone .
Women with untreated invasive squamous-cell carcinoma ,  adenosquamous carcinoma ,  or adenocarcinoma of the cervix of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIB (localized disease with parametrial involvement) ,  stage III (extension of the tumor to the pelvic wall) ,  or stage IVB (involvement of the bladder or rectal mucosa) were enrolled in the study from April 1992 to April 1997 .
Each patient was required to undergo a complete physical examination ,  a pelvic examination under anesthesia ,  chest radiography ,  and intravenous pyelography or abdominal computed tomography to determine the clinical stage of the cancer .
Patients were required to have a Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status of 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  or 3 (equivalent to Karnofsky performance scores of 90 or 100 ,  70 or 80 ,  50 or 60 ,  and 30 or 40 ,  respectively) and to have no history of other cancers .
Other eligibility criteria were as follows ,  a leukocyte count of at least 3000 per cubic millimeter ,  a platelet count of at least 100,000 per cubic millimeter ,  a serum creatinine level of no more than 2.0 mg per deciliter (177 umol per liter) ,  a serum bilirubin level that was no more than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal at the institution where it was measured ,  and a serum aspartate aminotransferase level that was no more than 3 times the upper limit of normal at the institution where it was measured .
Additional pretreatment evaluations included assessment of performance status and measurements of the cervical tumor and serum electrolytes and magnesium .
Radiotherapy was administered to the whole pelvic region in 24 fractions totaling 40.8 Gy or 30 fractions totaling 51.0 Gy ,  followed one to three weeks later by intracavitary brachytherapy (the insertion of a radioactive implant) .
Pelvic radiation was delivered by anteroposterior and posteroanterior parallel ports or a four-field box technique (anteroposterior ,  posteroanterior ,  and two lateral fields) with an x-ray energy of at least 4-MV photons .
The duration of the radiotherapy was 10 weeks .
The length of delays in radiotherapy ,  in days ,  was calculated by subtracting the planned duration of radiotherapy (the number of prescribed fractions plus 2 weekend days for every five fractions plus 10 days for each implant) from the actual duration of radiotherapy .
Treatment with hydroxyurea or fluorouracil was discontinued if the leukocyte count dropped below 3000 per cubic millimeter or the platelet count dropped below 100,000 per cubic millimeter ,  and it was resumed once the counts rose above these levels .
The design called for final analysis when disease progression (or death) had occurred in 104 patients receiving the control regimen (radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea) .
Thus ,  because of the large difference in outcome among the treatment groups and the similarity between the rates of survival and progression-free survival within each of the treatment groups ,  this analysis is the final analysis of survival and progression-free survival .
Forty-nine of these patients (9 percent) were subsequently found to be ineligible for the following reasons ,  because of deviations from the surgical protocol for the evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (44 patients) ,  ineligible stage of disease (2) ,  metastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes (1) ,  incorrect primary diagnosis (1) ,  and incomplete pretreatment testing (1) .
A multiple regression analysis of progression-free survival was performed that included the prognostic variables identified by Stehman et al ,  clinical stage of disease ,  tumor size as assessed by physical examination ,  status of pelvic lymph nodes ,  age at diagnosis ,  and performance status .
A total of 205 patients have died (39 percent) ,  59 in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  57 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 89 in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
Patients in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea had less local progression (19 percent and 20 percent ,  respectively) than those in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy (30 percent) .
The median delay was 8 days (the 10th percentile was a time 2 days ahead of schedule ,  and the 90th percentile was a delay of 22 days) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  10 days (10th and 90th percentiles ,  1 and 26) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 8 days (10th and 90th percentiles ,  1 day ahead of schedule and a delay of 23 days) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
The highest combined frequency of grade 3 (moderate) and grade 4 (severe) adverse effects was associated with treatment with radiotherapy and the three-drug regimen ,  the frequency in the other two groups was similar .
The effects of chemotherapy should not interfere with the planned course of radiation ,  and one advantage of cisplatin is that it has limited adverse effects on bone marrow .
In a phase 3 trial conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group ,  388 patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy either with cisplatin and fluorouracil or with hydroxyurea (Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) ,  the two-drug regimen improved survival (relative risk of death ,  0.74 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.58 to 0.95) .
In our study ,  the duration of radiotherapy and the dose of radiation were similar among the three regimens , implying that the differences in progression-free survival and survival were related to the chemotherapy .
Our results demonstrate the superiority of radiotherapy and chemotherapy either with cisplatin alone or with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (stage IIB ,  III ,  or IVA without metastasis to the para-aortic lymph nodes) .
