Background and MethodsWe compared the effect of radiotherapy to a pelvic and para-aortic field with that of pelvic radiation and concurrent chemotherapywith fluorouracil and cisplatin in women with advanced cervical cancer .
Between 1990 and 1997 ,  403 women with advanced cervical cancerconfined to the pelvis (stages IIB through IVA or stage IB or IIA with a tumor diameter of at least 5 cm or involvement of pelvic lymph nodes) were randomly assigned to receive either 45 Gy of radiation to the pelvis and para-aortic lymph nodes or 45 Gy of radiation to the pelvis alone plus two cycles of fluorouracil and cisplatin (days 1 through 5 and days 22 through 26 of radiation) .
Patients were then to receive one or two applications of low-dose-rate intracavitary radiation ,  with a third cycle of chemotherapy planned for the second intracavitary procedure in the combined-therapy group .
ResultsOf the 403 eligible patients ,  193 in each group could be evaluated .
The median duration of follow-up was 43 months .
Estimated cumulative rates of survival at five years were 73 percent among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy and 58 percent among patients treated with radiotherapy alone (P=0.004) .
Cumulative rates of disease-free survival at five years were 67 percent among patients in the combined-therapy group and 40 percent among patients in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) .
The rates of both distant metastases (P<0.001) and locoregional recurrences (P<0.001) were significantly higher among patients treated with radiotherapy alone .
The seriousness of side effects was similar in the two groups ,  with a higher rate of reversible hematologic effects in the combined-therapy group .
ConclusionsThe addition of chemotherapy with fluorouracil and cisplatin to treatment with external-beam and intracavitary radiation significantly improved survival among women with locally advanced cervical cancer .
