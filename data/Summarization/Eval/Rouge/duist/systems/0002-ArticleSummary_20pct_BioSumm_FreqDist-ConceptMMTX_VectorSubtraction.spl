CERVICAL cancer is the second most frequent cancer among women worldwide and the most frequent cancer among women in Africa ,  Asia ,  and South America .
As a result ,  about 25 percent of patients with cervical cancer in the United States present with locally advanced disease (stage IIB through IVA according to the staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) .
Radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea has been compared in separate trials with radiotherapy alone ,  with radiotherapy and concomitant therapy with misonidazole ,  and with radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil (and Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) .
In addition ,  the responses in phase 2 trials of this chemotherapy regimen with radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer and in patients with head and neck cancer were favorable .
METHODS .
Eligibility .
All cancers were confirmed histologically by the Gynecologic Oncology Group pathology committee .
Interstitial and high-dose brachytherapy were not allowed .
The duration of the radiotherapy was 10 weeks .
The Radiological Physics Center in Houston reviewed all technical aspects of radiotherapy and verified the calibration of the instruments used .
Statistical Analysis .
Randomization was carried out by a block arrangement ,  the treatment assignments were stratified according to center and the three clinical stages of disease ,  with approximately equal numbers assigned to each treatment group .
Life-table estimates were calculated according to the method of Kaplan and Meier ,  and differences in progression-free survival were evaluated with use of the log-rank test according to the intention-to-treat principle .
Pearson's chi-square test was used to detect differences in the incidence of adverse effects among treatment regimens .
The performance of these interim tests raised the type I error by only 0.05 percent .
RESULTS .
Characteristics of the Patients .
There were no significant differences in the clinical characteristics among the three treatment groups (Table 2) .
As of this writing ,  75 percent of the patients have either died or have been followed for 30 months .
Adverse Effects .
There were no treatment-related deaths .
DISCUSSION .
Despite improvements in radiation equipment and techniques ,  in approximately two thirds of the cases ,  progression occurs within the area that was irradiated .
Because of its cytotoxic effect ,  the drug reduces the bulk of tumors ,  which leads to reoxygenation of the tumor and entry of the cells into a radiation-sensitive phase of the cell cycle .
In a study of 19 human cervical-cancer cell lines ,  Britten et al. found that radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin increased the rates of death of these tumor cells .
The effect of radiotherapy with concomitant treatment with cisplatin alone has been studied in several phase 2 trials .
Nevertheless ,  there were no significant differences in the length of radiotherapy among the three groups .
In our study ,  the duration of radiotherapy and the dose of radiation were similar among the three regimens , implying that the differences in progression-free survival and survival were related to the chemotherapy .
Treatment with cisplatin alone was less toxic than treatment with the three-drug regimen .
