although much progress has been made in the early detection and control of carcinoma of the cervix since the introduction of the papanicolau test it is estimated that about 13 500 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 1990 in the united states with 6 000 patients dying from the disease 
the rationale for the use of neoadjuvant ct23 is that 1 the blood supply to the tumor is not compromised by previous radiotherapy or surgery allowing for better drug distribution into the tumor 2 patients tolerance to ct may be enhanced as performance status and marrow reserve are unaltered by previous treatment 3 decreasing the bulkiness of the primary disease would improve the effectiveness of the local rt 4 there is the possibility of eradication of subclinical metastases and 5 theoretically a tumor may be more chemosensitive before surgery or rt 
although 25 5 of the patients achieved a cr following three cycles of bomp and 47 of the ct rt group obtained a cr at the end of rt the 5 year overall survival was significantly inferior in the ct rt group than in the control arm 39 v 21 p 02 
a cr was defined as the complete resolution of all measurable disease and symptoms a partial response pr was defined as a 50 or more decrease in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of measurable disease and stable disease sd was defined as less than a 50 decrease in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of the measurable lesions 
the incidence is even more pronounced in developing countries where carcinoma of the cervix is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in females with the majority of the patients presenting with advanced disease 
it cannot be accounted for by patient selection as both groups were well balanced for the wellknown prognostic factors in stage iii carcinoma of the cervix 4 24 27 more importantly all patients in the ct rt arm completed pelvic rt as defined by the protocol guidelines and therefore inadequate irradiation dosage cannot explain the poorer results 
while surgery and radiotherapy rt are equally effective in early stage disease radiation therapy has been the primary treatment modality for stage iii disease with 5 year survival rates between 30 to 45 being reported 4 8 attempts to improve these results including the use of hypoxic cell sensitizers hyperbaric oxygen therapy 0 and neutron therapy have met with limited or no success 
the superior limit of the radiation field was the l5 s1 junction the lower limit wasthe caudal pole of obturator foramen and the lateral boundaries were 1 5 cm beyond the lymph nodes as demonstrated on lymphangiography 
the choice of end point in assessing the therapeuticbenefit of a new treatment modality in advanced carcinoma of the cervix has to be determined carefully 
the role of chemotherapy ct either as a single agent or in combination has been extensively evaluated in advanced or recurrent disease 
late complications were graded as per the morbidity grading system suggested by pilepich et al 2 which takes into consideration the impact of the complication on the patient performance and or life style and the required treatment for such complications table 2 
similarly in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck upfront ct has produced impressive response rates but again this has not led to an improvement in survival rates over those achieved with rt alone 
withers et a1 have suggested that the accelerated repopulationlate in the treatment involves only a small number of surviving cells and rapid repopulation would not be detectable as a change in volume of the total tumor mass 
in this study 27 of the patients 14 of 52 in the rt group were called partial responders at the end of irradiation 
for the partial responders 57 in the rt arm and 37 5 in the ct rt are alive with no evidence of disease progression at a minimum follow up time of 3 years 
as of december 1989 31 of the 52 patients in the rt group and 30 of 39 in the ct rt had died 
thus there were 39 assessable patients in the ct rt arm and 52 in the rt arm 
in table 4 we show the number of patients still alive in spite of their disease being classified as pr at the end of treatment 
transvaginal parametrial needle biopsy has been used to detect postirradiation recurrent cancer of the cervix and may also play an important role in defining treatment response 
the use of upfront ct as initial treatment before pelvic rt would be theoretically advantageous as the vascular supply to the tumor is not compromised allowing a higher local tissue concentration of drugs thereby improving the effectiveness of ct 
to test this hypothesis we began in 1984 at the instituto nacional de cancer rio de janeiro brazil a prospective randomized trial comparing neoadjuvant bomp ct followed by pelvic rt ct rt versus pelvic rt alone in patients with stage iiib carcinoma of the cervix 
the third bleomycin cycle was either withheld or the bleomycin dose was reduced in 15 of the patients mainly because of severe skin hyperpigmentation 
this study was designed with the objective of answering the question of whether neoadjuvant bomp chemotherapy is effective in stage iii b carcinoma of the cervix 
eligibility criteria consisted of a histopathologic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma age younger than 70 years with no past history of malignancy the lower third of the vagina free of disease and a performance status greater than 50 in the karnofsky scale 
the role of concurrent radiosensitizing ct has yet to be established in advanced carcinoma of the cervix but this approach deserves further exploitation 
median survivals were 25 months in the rt arm and 10 5 months in the ct rt 
the effectiveness of this approach will be evaluated in the near future by a prospective and randomized phase iii trial sponsored by the national cancer institute of canada 
six months after activation of the study after nine patients had been treated with ct the bleomycin dose was reduced to 15 u im every 12 hours from day 1 to day 3 total dose 90 u and after the first year cisplatin administration was changed from day 1 to day 4 
although not a requirement of the study attempts were made to keep the hemoglobin level 120 g l during pelvic irradiation 
furthermore even if we exclude the patients who experienced treatment related death the survival in the bomp group remains significantly inferior 39 v 25 
the most likely explanation for the poorer results in these neoadjuvant trials is the enhancement of accelerated tumor cell proliferation during treatment 
patients in the combined modality group were also assessed for local response at the completion of ct and before the start of rt 
a more detailed description of the pulmonary toxicity has been the subject of another report
