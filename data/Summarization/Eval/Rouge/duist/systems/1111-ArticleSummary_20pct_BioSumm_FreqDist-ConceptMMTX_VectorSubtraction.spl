INTRODUCTION .
Traditionally ,  women with lymph node metastases have been treated with postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy .
Study Design .
Women with one of the combinations of risk factors as defined in Table 1 were eligible to enter this study .
In 1993 ,  the sample size goal was increased because of the lower than expected recurrence rate ,  a better estimate of the change in the recurrence rate over time ,  and a small ,  but significant ,  frequency of noncompliance in the radiation therapy (RT) regimen .
Eligibility .
Any disagreement among the reviewing pathologists was resolved by a GOG referee pathologist .
RESULTS .
Between March 1988 and September 1995 ,  299 women were accessioned into the study .
Of the remaining 277 eligible patients ,  137 were randomly assigned to radiotherapy and 140 to no further treatment .
The tumor cell type was squamous in 218 (79%) women ,  adenosquamous in 32 (12%) ,  and adenocarcinoma in 27 (10%) .
There was a disproportionately larger number of patients with positive CLS among the NFT regimen (24% versus 35%) and more patients with .4 cm diameter tumors in the RT regimen (62% versus 54%) .
By contrast ,  there were only 21 (15.3%) cancer recurrences ,  18 (13.1%) local and 3 (2.2%) distant among the 137 patients treated with postoperative radiation .
The crude estimate in the reduction in risk in patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy was 47% (i.e. ,  relative risk 5 0.53) with the recurrence-free rate of 88% in the radiotherapy group and 79% in the no-further-therapy group at 2 years (Fig. 1) .
Eighty-six percent of patients have either died or have been followed at least 3 years .
There is a small but noteworthy imbalance in the follow-up between the two treatment regimens .
Of those who are alive ,  six patients are lost-to-follow-up within the first year in the RT group while one is lost in the NFT group .
DISCUSSION .
The invasion of lymphvascular spaces by tumor has been found to be an unfavorable prognostic factor by many investigators but its significance was denied by others .
Of the three risk factors ,  depth of invasion seems the most objective and accurate method—a direct measurement on the histological slide .
Estimating tumor diameter by palpation is more subjective and imprecise than the direct measurement of the depth of invasion .
Nevertheless ,  the use of this formula by the participating institutions has been successful in achieving a high acceptance rate with only 22 patients (7%) found ineligible for the study .
However ,  the combination of factors proved more accurate than any of the factors alone .
By contrast ,  in women with positive nodes local failure is more frequently associated with metastases in distant sites that are not affected by pelvic irradiation .
However ,  no such evidence from randomized trials is available about effective treatment of positive lymph nodes .
A significant number of women with Stage IB cervical cancer should benefit from adjuvant pelvic irradiation because 25% of the lymph-node negative patients have high risk factors according to the 1990 GOG data .
Moreover ,  Thomas and Dembo have demonstrated that ,  in absolute terms ,  an equal number of deaths occur among the estimated 85% of Stage IB cervical cancer patients with negative nodes as among the 15% with positive nodes .
One of these women died from complications of enteric fistula and another died from cancer after successful management of intestinal injury .
Three of 5 women with major adverse effects recovered either spontaneously or after appropriate treatment .
The rate of postradiation complications in our study was similar to those reported in the literature .
