Stratification was by primary versus recurrent tumors and by tumor diameter greater than or equal to 10 cm versus less than 10 cm. One hundred four patients were randomized ,  51 to the control group and 53 to the treatment group (five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin 60 mg/m2 days 1 and 2 and ifosfamide 1.8 g/m2 days 1 through 5 ,  with hydration ,  mesna ,  and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) .
Inclusion criteria were as follows ,  age ,  18 to 65 years ,  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2 ,  primary tumors subfascially localized with diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm ,  high-grade spindle-cell or polymorphous sarcomas (fibrosarcoma ,  malignant fibrous histiocytoma ,  polymorphous liposarcoma ,  leiomyosarcoma ,  synovial sarcoma ,  malignant schwannoma ,  angiosarcoma ,  and polymorphous rhabdomyosarcoma) ,  local relapse of any size ,  no previous radio/chemotherapy ,  adequate bone marrow (WBC count of >= 4,000/fiL ,  platelets = 120.000/mL ,  and hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL) ,  renal (creatinine <= 1.3 mg/dL) ,  hepatic (SGOT <= 2.5 X normal value and bilirubin <= 1.2 mg/dL) ,  and pulmonary functions .
Preoperative radiation therapy (44.8 Gy in 28 fractions in 2.5 weeks ,  160 cGy/ fraction ,  2 fractions per day) followed by resection with or without a post-or intraoperative boost (16 to 18 Gy for positive or close surgical margins) was used for tumors extending to critical structures for which conservative surgical resection was expected to be inadequate and amputation would usually have to be performed to obtain negative margins .
Chemotherapy ,  repeated every 3 weeks ,  consisted of five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin (EPI) 60 mg/m2/die ,  in a short intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1 and 2 (total dose per cycle ,  120 mg/m2) ,  IFO 1.8 g/m2/die diluted in 500 mL of normal saline and administered over 1 hour on days 1 through 5 (total dose per cycle ,  9 g/m2) ,  and 6-mercapto-ethansulfonate in a bolus IV injection at 20% of the IFO dose ,  given before and 4 and 8 hours after the IFO infusions .
In the case of incomplete hematologic recovery (defined as WBC < 4,000/mL and platelets [PLTS] < 100.000/mL) ,  treatment was postponed by one or more weeks ,  furthermore ,  on complete hematologic recovery ,  a dose reduction of EPI was applied depending on the observed nadirs (WBC > 1,000/mL and PLTS > 75.000/mL ,  IFO and EPI doses both 100% ,  WBC > 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL ,  IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 75% ,  WBC < 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL ,  IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 50%) .
The present article deals with a minimum observation time of 36 months calculated from the date of randomization of the last patient (11 of 96) .
Overall ,  13 patients had a local recurrence of disease as the first relapse without simultaneous distant metastases (four patients in the treatment arm and nine patients in the control arm ,  Table 4) .
The preliminary data of previous studies were sometimes positive for DFS and OS , 15-19 but further analyses ,  made after an adequate follow-up time ,  indicated a disappearance of the positive effect of chemotherapy on 20,21 and ,  in some cases ,  worse results.22 However ,  the recently published meta-analysis , 7 involving 1,568 patients ,  showed a statistically significant benefit for treated patients of 6% ,  10% ,  and 10% for local ,  metastatic ,  and overall DFS ,  respectively ,  and a favorable (but not statistically significant) trend in OS (4%) ,  after a median of 9.4 years of follow-up .
The main finding of the intention-to-treat analysis in this study is the beneficial impact of chemotherapy on the DFS (P = .04) and OS (P = .03) for patients affected by high-risk extremity soft tissue sarcomas and treated with chemotherapy .
However ,  because our study was designed in 1991 and activated in June 1992 and included only 104 patients ,  it is possible that an imbalance of other prognostic factors not included in Table 1 could have led to the difference in outcome between the two groups .
