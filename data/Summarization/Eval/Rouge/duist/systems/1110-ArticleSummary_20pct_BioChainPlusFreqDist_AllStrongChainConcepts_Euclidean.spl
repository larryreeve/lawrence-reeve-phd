The nationwide use of such screening programs has greatly reduced the incidence of invasive cervical cancer .
We report the first results of this study .
The initial evaluation also included chest radiography ,  cystoscopy ,  proctoscopy ,  a complete blood count ,  and measurement of liver and renal function .
The radiation dose was keyed to the central ray at the patient’s midplane (for anteroposterior– posteroanterior fields) or to the isocenter of the beams .
The total dose to be delivered to pelvic lymph nodes as well as to para-aortic nodes was 45 Gy ,  given at a dose of 1.8 Gy per fraction of radiation .
Interstitial brachytherapy was used only if necessary to increase the dose directedat distal vaginal sites of disease .
The suggested maximal doses to the bladder ,  the rectum ,  and the lateral surface of the vagina were 75 ,  70 ,  and 130 Gy ,  respectively .
Two additional cycles of chemotherapy were scheduled at three-week intervals .
One of these was administered at the time of the second intracavitary insertion .
All chemotherapy records were reviewed by a gynecologic oncologist to assess compliance with the protocol .
Overall survival was the primary end point for the comparison of the two treatments and was calculated from the date of study entry until the date of death or the date of the last follow-up visit .
Disease- free survival was also compared in the two groups and was calculated from the date of study entry to the date of the first occurrence of disease progression ,  a second diagnosis of cancer ,  or death from any cause ,  or if none of these events occurred ,  to the date of the last follow-up visit .
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate both survival rates .
The statistical significance of associations between treatment assignments and characteristics of the patients was assessed by chi-square analysis .
Acute side effects of treatment were defined as those that occurred within 60 days after the completion of radiotherapy ,  and late effects were defined as those occurring or persisting more than 60 days after radiotherapy .
The nominal significance level required for early reporting was origioriginally set at P=0.005 ,  but we subsequently adopted a more conservative approach ,  because it allowed the number of deaths observed to determine the nominal level required for early reporting .
The median total duration of radiation was 58 days ,  with a mean dose of 89 Gy delivered to point A in each group .
Four patients refused or were unable to receive ny chemotherapy but were included in the analysis according to the intention to treat .
The median duration of follow-up was 43 months .
The estimated five-year survival rates according to various stratification variables are summarized in Table 5 .
Approximately 70 percent of the patients assigned to each group had stage IB ,  IIA ,  or IIB disease .
For these patients ,  overall survival was significantly better if they were treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
The inclusion of chemotherapy substantially reduced both local and distant recurrences of cervical cancer ,  leading to higher overall and disease-free survival rates .
Although chemotherapy  increased the hematologic toxicity ,  this effect was reversible and the incidence of late side effects was similar in the two treatment groups .
As a result ,  the median dose was higher and the median duration of treatment was shorter than those reported in other studies .
The results of the Patterns of Care studies and large retrospective analyses suggest that these features correlate with survival rates and rates of local control of cervical cancer .
We also used a somewhat more aggressive regimen of chemotherapy than have other groups .
We used a higher dose of cisplatin (75 mg per square meter) than that used with fluorouracil in the Gynecologic Oncology Group studies ,  and we also included a third cycle of chemotherapy during one of the intracavitary procedures .
Reports by Rose et al. and Keys et al. in this issue of the Journal strengthen the body of evidence supporting the use of combined therapy in women with advanced cervical cancer .
