After randomisation ,  there were six protocol violations: two in the surgery group (one progression before operation and one refusal of any therapy after randomisation) and four in the radiotherapy group (two patients whose cancer was incorrectly staged and two with synchronous neoplasia) .
Therefore 170 patients in the surgery group and 167 in the radiotherapy group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis .
Ten patients crossed over treatment: one refused surgery and was irradiated ,  and nine refused radiotherapy and underwent surgery .
Thus ,  169 in the surgery group and 158 in the radiotherapy group underwent the scheduled treatment (compliance of 98% for surgery and 92% for radiotherapy) .
The mean age of patients in the radiotherapy group was slightly greater than that of patients in the surgery group .
Lymphangiography revealed positive nodes in 24 (14%) surgery-group patients and in 22 (13%) radiotherapy group patients .
Adjuvant radiotherapy was done in 62 (54%) of the 114 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter of 4 cm or smaller and in 46 (84%) of 55 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm. 19 patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or less and three patients whose cervical diameter was greater than 4 cm had lymph-vascular-space involvement as the only pathological risk factor; 5-year actuarial disease-free survival for the surgery and radiotherapy groups was 80% and 82% ,  respectively ,  for patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or smaller ,  and 63% and 57% for those with a diameter larger than 4 cm; Overall survival for the 108 surgery-group patients who received adjuvant treatment (high-risk group) compared with the patients with surgery alone (low-risk group) or radiotherapy alone (unknown risk) is shown in figure 4 ,   Overall ,  86 (25ÿ¿¿¿¿¿5%) patients developed recurrent disease: 42 (25%) in the surgery group and 44 (26%) in the radiotherapy group .
Among the patients who developed recurrent disease ,  six (14%) in the surgery group and 13 (30%) in the radiotherapy group were cured; Of the 86 patients who developed a recurrence ,  50 (58%) had local or pelvic recurrence (22 [52%] in the surgery group vs 28 [64%] in the radiotherapy group ,  p=0ÿ¿¿¿¿¿42) ,  and 36 (42%) had distant metastases (20 [48%] vs 16 [36%] ,  p=0ÿ¿¿¿¿¿62); Thus ,  169 patients in the surgery group and 158 in the radiotherapy group were included in this analysis .
Complications were classified according to the glossary of Chassagne and colleagues.10 In the surgery group ,  48 (28%) patients showed severe (grade 2ÿ¿¿¿¿¿3) morbidity that required medical or surgical treatment ,  compared with 19 (12%) patients in the radiotherapy group ,  (p=0ÿ¿¿¿¿¿0004; Grade 2 or 3 complications affected 19 (31%) patients who had surgery alone and 29 (27%) patients who received surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy (p=0ÿ¿¿¿¿¿71) .
The relative risk of this complication for surgery plus radiotherapy versus surgery alone was 3ÿ¿¿¿¿¿11 (95% CI 0ÿ¿¿¿¿¿71ÿ¿¿¿¿¿13ÿ¿¿¿¿¿56) and was 2ÿ¿¿¿¿¿01 (95% CI 0ÿ¿¿¿¿¿84ÿ¿¿¿¿¿4ÿ¿¿¿¿¿8%) for surgery plus radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone .
Chronic neurological bladder was observed in eight (13%) patients who had surgery alone and in five (5%) patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy .
Other vesical complications (severe actinic cystitis ,  stress incontinence ,  high-pressure bladder) were recorded in two (3%) patients after surgery ,  11 (10%) after surgery plus radiotherapy ,  and in eight (5%) after radiotherapy alone .
Ileal obstruction occurred in six (5%) patients who underwent surgery plus radiotherapy and in two (1%) who received radical radiotherapy .
In the radiotherapy group ,  one patient had intestinal perforation ,  one rectovaginal fistula ,  and 12 severe proctites .
Severe oedema of the legs occurred in ten (9%) patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy ,  in one (0ÿ¿¿¿¿¿6%) patient who had radiotherapy alone ,  and in none of the patients who had surgery alone .
Pelvic lymphocyst occurred in five (8%) patients after surgery and in five (15%) after surgery plus radiotherapy .
Abdominal hernia occurred in seven patients ,  of whom four received surgery alone and three received surgery plus radiotherapy .
25% of the surgery-group patients and 26% patients in the radiotherapy group developed neoplastic recurrence .
Clinical prognostic factors can prove useful to select those patients who should be treated primarily by irradiation ,  reserving surgery for patients who do not need adjuvant treatment .
