In 1990 ,  the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) began a randomized clinical trial to compare the effects on survival of treatment with extended-field radiation and treatment with pelvic radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in patients with cervical cancer .
On the basis of the results of two earlier RTOG trials ,  we predicted that the five-year survival rate for the control group (radiotherapy alone) would be 65 percent for patients with stage IB or II disease and 40 percent for patients with stage III or IVA disease .
Fifteen patients (4 percent) ÿ¿¿¿¿¿ six in the combined-therapy group and nine in the radiotherapy group ÿ¿¿¿¿¿ were subsequently disqualified because of failure to undergo the required evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (eight patients) ,  the presence of extrapelvic cancer (two) ,  the presence of a rare histologic subtype (one) ,  the presence of a stage IB1 tumor with no involvement of pelvic nodes (one) ,  the absence of pretreatment data (two) ,  and receipt of chemotherapy before radiotherapy (one) .
Radiotherapy was delivered according to the protocol or with minor deviations in 83 percent of the patients in the combined-therapy group and 84 percent of those in the radiotherapy group .
Eleven patients (3 percent) did not undergo brachytherapy: three patients refused ,  and eight patients did not undergo it for other reasons .
Of the 195 patients in the combination-therapy group ,  159 (81 percent) completed at least two cycles of chemotherapy ,  and 133 (68 percent) completed three cycles .
Chemotherapy was discontinued because of toxic effects in 9 patients ,  refusal to continue in the case of 17 patients ,  diminished performance status in 4 patients ,  and other reasons in 4 patients .
Follow-up data were available for 193 of the 195 patients in the combined-therapy group and for all 193 patients in the radiotherapy group .
Of these ,  147 patients in the combined-therapy group (76 percent) and 122 patients in the radiotherapy group (63 percent) were alive at the time of the last analysis .
In addition ,  13 patients in the combined-therapy group and 32 patients in the radiotherapy group were alive  but had recurrent cervical cancer .
Kaplanÿ¿¿¿¿¿Meier analysis revealed that overall survival rates were significantly better among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy than among those treated with radiotherapy alone (73 percent vs. Disease-free survival at five years was 67 percent in the combined-therapy group and 40 percent in the radiotherapy group ,  according to Kaplanÿ¿¿¿¿¿Meier analysis (P<0.001) (Fig. The rates of distant relapse were 14 percent in the combined-therapy group and 33 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) ,  with a relative risk of relapse of 0.39 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.24 to 0.63) in the combined-therapy group .
The rate of locoregional recurrences was 19 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 35 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) ,  with a relative risk of locoregional recurrences of 0.47 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.31 to 0.71) in the combined-therapy group .
There was no significant difference in overall survival between treatment groups among patients who had stage III or IVA disease ,  although  the study was not designed to have a sufficient number of patients in these subgroups to test for a statistically significant difference .
For patients with stage III or IVA disease ,  the five-year disease-free survival rates were 58 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 38 percent in the radiotherapy group (P=0.13) .
Although the group reported significant improvements in overall and disease-free survival with the addition of hydroxyurea therapy ,  the study has been criticized for the use of a low dose of radiation and the poor survival rates in both groups and because more than half of the 190 patients who were enrolled could not be evaluated .
Despite these criticisms ,  the results of that study and those of trials assessing concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy for other tumors stimulated studies of the effects of radiotherapy and various combinations of fluorouracil ,  cisplatin ,  mitomycin ,  carboplatin ,  and paclitaxel as treatments for locally advanced cervical cancer .
The results of these trials have been encouraging ,  but mostclinicians have not found them sufficiently  convincing to justify the inclusion of chemotherapy in the routine treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer .
