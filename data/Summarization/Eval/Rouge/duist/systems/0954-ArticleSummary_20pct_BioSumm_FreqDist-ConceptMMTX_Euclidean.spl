TRIALS of postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer conducted during the 1960s and 1970s showed significant reductions in rates of locoregional recurrence but no improvement in overall survival .
Nevertheless ,  there are reasons to reconsider radiotherapy ,  including the limited value of adjuvant chemotherapy for bulky disease ,  a synergistic effect of chemotherapy plus radiation on residual locoregional tumor ,  and the possibility that eliminating bulky disease with radiation may improve the effect of chemotherapy ,  because chemotherapy may be more effective when the overall disease burden is low .
This report presents our findings after 15 years of follow-up .
The mastectomy was performed according to standard surgical practice between 1979 and 1986 .
The characteristics of the patients were evenly balanced ,  as Table 1 shows .
The interval between the fourth and fifth cycles of chemotherapy was five to six weeks .
Statistical Analysis .
In the survival analysis ,  the time to the end points associated with each event was calculated from the date of the tissue diagnosis of breast cancer .
Subgroups Based on Nodal Involvement .
Side Effects of Radiation .
Limited apical lung fibrosis developed in most of the irradiated patients ,  but only one had interstitial pneumonitis requiring corticosteroids ,  with full resolution on chest radiography several weeks later .
In one patient with a right-sided breast lesion , congestive heart failure developed 14 years after radiotherapy ,  at the age of 63 .
There were no cases of brachial plexopathy .
DISCUSSION .
There was no excess mortality we could attribute to the long-term side effects of radiotherapy .
There was an important increase in the number of deaths not due to breast cancer among the irradiated patients (P 0.002) .
Our data suggest that locoregional disease is not only a marker of systemic disease but also ,  in some patients ,  a potential source for its future dissemination .
Our data indicate that locoregional disease remaining after definitive surgery may be an important source of systemic disease .
The elimination of locoregional cancer cells by radiotherapy added to adjuvant chemotherapy may reduce mortality in selected patients with breast cancer .
