The first intracavitary treatment was performed before or during external-beam radiotherapy ,  and additional external-beam therapy was delivered with a midline block .
The protocol specified that all patients receive a total cumulative dose to point A (a reference location 2 cm lateral and 2 cmsuperior to the cervical os) of at least 85 Gy .
Within 16 hours after the first radiation fraction was administered ,  patients in the combination-therapy group received the first cycle of chemotherapy ,  which consisted of an intravenous infusion of 75 mg of cisplatin per square meter of body-surface area over a 4-hour period followed by an intravenous infusion of 4000 mg of fluorouracil per square meter over a 96-hour period .
Once treatment ended ,  patients were evaluated every three months for the first two years ,  every four months during the third year ,  every six months during the fourth and fifth years ,  and then annually .
Toxicity was assessed at the time of each evaluation with use of the Cooperative Group Common Toxicity Criteria ,  the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria ,  and the Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme of the RTOG and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer .
Variations were scored as minor ,  major but acceptable ,  or major and unacceptable ,  if they differed by more than 5 ,  10 ,  or 20 percent ,  respectively ,  from the specified dose of radiation or duration of treatment .
Five-year rates of secondary end points such as locoregional recurrence ,  para-aortic recurrence ,  and distant metastasis were estimated with the use of cumulative-incidence methods , and treatment effects were tested with use of the Gray algorithm .
The study was initially designed to be able to detect a reduction of 33 percent in the annual death rate ,  with a statistical power of 80 percent and a two-sided significance level of 0.05 .
On the basis of the results of two earlier RTOG trials ,  we predicted that the five-year survival rate for the control group (radiotherapy alone) would be 65 percent for patients with stage IB or II disease and 40 percent for patients with stage III or IVA disease .
A 33 percent reduction in the death rate as a result of chemotherapy would yield an absolute improvement of approximately 10 percent in the five-year survival rate .
Interim analyses were scheduled to occur when 50 percent of the patients had been enrolled and when the enrollment goal was met .
Fifteen patients (4 percent) — six in the combined-therapy group and nine in the radiotherapy group — were subsequently disqualified because of failure to undergo the required evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (eight patients) ,  the presence of extrapelvic cancer (two) ,  the presence of a rare histologic subtype (one) ,  the presence of a stage IB1 tumor with no involvement of pelvic nodes (one) ,  the absence of pretreatment data (two) ,  and receipt of chemotherapy before radiotherapy (one) .
Radiotherapy was delivered according to the protocol or with minor deviations in 83 percent of the patients in the combined-therapy group and 84 percent of those in the radiotherapy group .
Major but acceptable treatment deviations occurred in another 1 percent and 9 percent of these groups ,  respectively .
Eleven patients (3 percent) did not undergo brachytherapy ,  three patients refused ,  and eight patients did not undergo it for other reasons .
Of the 195 patients in the combination-therapy group ,  159 (81 percent) completed at least two cycles of chemotherapy ,  and 133 (68 percent) completed three cycles .
Four patients refused or were unable to receive ny chemotherapy but were included in the analysis according to the intention to treat .
Of these ,  147 patients in the combined-therapy group (76 percent) and 122 patients in the radiotherapy group (63 percent) were alive at the time of the last analysis .
Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that overall survival rates were significantly better among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy than among those treated with radiotherapy alone (73 percent vs. 58 percent ,  P=0.004) (Table 5 and Fig. 1) .
Disease-free survivalat five years was 67 percent in the combined-therapy group and 40 percent in the radiotherapy group ,  according to Kaplan–Meier analysis (P<0.001) (Fig. 2) .
The relative likelihood of disease-free survival in the combined-therapy group ,  as compared with the radiotherapy group ,  was 0.48 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.35 to 0.66) .
The rates of distant relapse were 14 percent in the combined-therapy group and 33 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) ,  with a relative risk of relapse of 0.39 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.24 to 0.63) in the combined-therapy group .
The rate of locoregional recurrences was 19 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 35 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) ,  with a relative risk of locoregional recurrences of 0.47 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.31 to 0.71) in the combined-therapy group .
Approximately 70 percent of the patients assigned to each group had stage IB ,  IIA ,  or IIB disease .
There was no significant difference in overall survival between treatment groups among patients who had stage III or IVA disease ,  although  the study was not designed to have a sufficient number of patients in these subgroups to test for a statistically significant difference .
For patients with stage III or IVA disease ,  the five-year disease-free survival rates were 58 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 38 percent in the radiotherapy group (P=0.13) .
Although the group reported significant improvements in overall and disease-free survival with the addition of hydroxyurea therapy ,  the study has been criticized for the use of a low dose of radiation and the poor survival rates in both groups and because more than half of the 190 patients who were enrolled could not be evaluated .
Future studies will continue to evaluate cisplatin and fluorouracil as well as other drugs to determine the most effective doses and routes of administration .
In our study ,  the benefit of para-aortic radiation may have been less than that observed in an earlier RTOG trial ,  because our trial required more rigorous staging of para-aortic lymph nodes and included patients with more advanced pelvic disease .
