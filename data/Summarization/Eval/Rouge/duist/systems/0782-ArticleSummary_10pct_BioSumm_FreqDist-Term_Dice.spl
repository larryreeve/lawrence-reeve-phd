Patients were randomly assigned no adjuvant treatment (control group) or an immediate postoperative intraportal infusion of 500mg/m fluorouracil plus 5000 units heparin in 1 L 5% glucose per 24 h for 7 consecutive days (days 1-7) plus 10 mg/m mitomycin in a single dose on day 1 .
Postoperatively ,  blood counts and liver function tests were done on days 1 ,  3 ,  5 ,  7 ,  10 ,  14 ,  28 ,  and 42.Resected tissue was examined by histology and classified (Dukes' classification ,  Astler-Coller modification) .
Hazard ratios were derived from a proportional-hazards regression model with stratification for localisation of the tumour (colon vs rectum) and with covariates for nodal status (positive vs negative) and age (four groups ,  defined by the 25th ,  50th ,  and 75th percentiles of the age distribution of the evaluable patients-namely ,  57 ,  63 , and 69 years) .
The 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 1-9% (10/533 patients)-2.3% (6/266) in the control group and 1.5% (4/267) in the infusion group. 1 patient in each group died of myocardial infarction ,  2 patients in the control group died of refractory small-bowel obstruction ,  and 3 patients in each group died of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative septicaemia .
Transient leucopenia (<3 X10 white blood cells per L) developed in 6 patients during adjuvant chemotherapy ,  and the white-blood-cell count was significantly lower on postoperative days 7 and 10 in the infusion group than in the control group .
After median follow-up of 8 years we were notable to confirm the overall reduction of liver metastases reported by Taylor et al. We did find ,  however ,  a consistent reduction of all kinds of tumour recurrences that resulted in a significant advantage in overall survival and disease-free survival for patients  treated with adjuvant portal infusion ,  confirming previous findings .
Two as yet unpublished meta-analyses of all randomised trials comparing portal adjuvant chemotherapy with a no-treatment control group have been conducted by the European Organization on Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Oxford Colorectal Cancer Cooperative Group .
However ,  none of the studies couldc onfirm the statistically significant overall effect on the frequency of liver metastases  reported by Taylor et al. It seems likely that the effect of adjuvant portal chemotherapy on overall and disease-free survival can be attributed to the systemic effects of intraportal fluorouracil ,  which lead to a reduction in all tumour relapses (ie ,  local recurrences ,  liver metastases ,  and other distant metastases) .
Deaths attributable to portal adjuvant chemotherapy have been reported in at least three trials ,  1 in Taylor et al’s study due to perirectal sepsis ,  1 in Fielding and colleagues' study (a patient more than 80 years old) ,  and 1 in our trial (an insulin-dependent diabetic man who had gram-negative septicaemia and leucopenia during portal infusion) .
For further studies ,  we recommend that patients with insulin-dependent diabetes ,  a high risk of postoperative complications (obesity ,  cardiac ,  and/or pulmonary disease) ,  or any evidence of intra-abdominal sepsis at laparotomy or during the early postoperative period ,  should be excluded from participation .
