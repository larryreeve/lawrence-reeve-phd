ADVANCED colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common oncologic challenges encountered in the Western world .
These effects presumably occur through the action of thymidine in blocking oxidative metabolism of 5-FU and increasing 5-FU incorporation into RNA .
They also observed one additional response among patients who had failed 5-FU .
PALA is a potent inhibitor of aspartate transcarbamylase and has a broad spectrum of activity in animal model tumor screens .
In human trials the dose-limiting toxicities were mucocutaneous reactions with minimal hematologic effects .
It has also been shown to have immunomodulatory effects .
Tissue from each patient was submitted to a pathology review committee to ensure eligibility and proper histopathologic classification .
On day I. 5-FU was administered 4 hours after PALA .
If the chest x-ray was negative pretreatment. this was repeated only with every other evaluation .
Treatment was continued until disease progression was documented .
For the comparison of any one of our drug combinations with 5-FU. this would permit our test for treatment effect to have .90 probability of detecting a true doubling in survival time (eg. from 6 to 12 months). while having only a .05 probability of obtaining a false-positive result when there were no true differences in survival .
It was required that this result be observed at least 4 weeks after the onset of therapy ,  but there was no requirement for duration of response .
The log rank statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with equality of survival curves ,  while the Cox partial likelihood score statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with the hypothesis that any one of the combinations would yield at least a 50% improvement in survival over 5-FU alone .
P values were two-sided .
Early termination did not occur .
Thus ,  essentially no adjustment of the P values given below is required .
A total of 347 patients were randomized on this study .
A total of 335 eligible patients were properly started on therapy and are included in the analysis below .
Seventy-six percent had an ECOG performance score of 0 or 1 .
The toxic reactions experienced according to treatment arm and severity are documented in Table 2 .
One patient died in irreversible coma .
The addition of levamisole to 5-FU had no discernable impact upon toxicity except for a slight increase in leukopenia .
There were three treatment-related deaths ,  one each on 5-FU alone ,  5-FU plus thymidine ,  and MOF-Strept .
The intervals to disease progression are shown in Fig 1 .
This was confirmed by a stratified Cox analysis ,  adjusting for key prognostic covariates ,  which indicated that the data were inconsistent with any combination regimen yielding a 50% increase in survival relative to 5-FU (ie ,  a hazard ratio of 1 .5) ,  wherefore 5-FU plus PALA ,  P < .01 ,  5-FU plus thymidine ,  P < .0001 ,  5-FU plus levamisole ,  P < .01 ,  and MOF-Strept ,  P < .05 .
In each of the regimens we tested ,  drug dosages and scheduling were admittedly largely arbitrary .
It is entirely possible that different proportionate representation of drug dosages or different scheduling could produce more favorable or less favorable results than we observed .
In designing the 5-FU-PALA regimen ,  we arbitrarily elected that both agents would be given at approximately equal proportions of the tolerable dose if each drug was used alone .
The total dose of 5-FU in this combination was only 12% of the dosage of 5-FU used alone that would produce a comparable degree of hematologic toxicity .
One cannot conclude that this regimen added to the quality of patient life ,  and since it did not add to duration of life ,  we must conclude that this regimen has little to recommend it .
The fact that all tissue was subjected to a common pathology review process may have produced sufficient uniformity of grading to allow this characteristic to be a useful predictor of survival .
We would hope this could be done more successfully with increasing knowledge of how best to apply the results of experimental models in the clinical settings .
