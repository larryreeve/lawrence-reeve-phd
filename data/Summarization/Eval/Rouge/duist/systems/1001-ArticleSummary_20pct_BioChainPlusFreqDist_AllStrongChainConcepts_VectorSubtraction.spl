Purpose ,  As previously shown ,  antibody treatment increased survival of patients with resected colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C .
Conclusion ,  The now-matured study shows that 17-1A antibody administered after surgery prevents the development of distant metastasis in approximately one third of patients .
Therefore ,  with no effect of antibody therapy on the local relapse at 5 years ,  It was of interest to know how the overall survival evolved at the 7-year follow-up evaluation .
Stratification and Randomization .
The presented 7-year follow-up data may therefore be considered mature and final .
A final status of 185 patients could be obtained for this analysis .
However ,  eleven patients who refused their treatment assignment were considered eligible and were included in all statistical analyses as participants in the treatment group .
Survival .
After 7 years ,  a total of 87 deaths were observed in 166 eligible patients .
The death rate of the observed group was 63% (48 of 76 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  48 to 78) of patients and that of the treated group was 43% (39 of 90 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  31 to 58) .
Thus ,  treatment with antibody led to a relative reduction of mortality by 32% (hazards ratio ,  0.57 ,  95% confidence interval ,  8% to 51%) .
The KaplanMeier survival curves (Fig 1A) showed a significant benefit for patients who received antibody over those who did not receive treatment (P < .01 with Cox's proportional hazard model corrected for influence of prognostic variables ,  and P = .01 with log-rank test for the univariate analysis) .
The calculated recurrence rate was 68% (49 of 76 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  53 to 82) m the control group and 52% (47 of 90 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  39 to 67) in the 17-1A group .
Antibody treatment increased time to recurrence (P = .04 with Cox proportional hazards model corrected for influence of prognostic variables ,  and P = .07 with log-rank test for umvanate analysis) .
However ,  when death without recurrence was considered an event (recurrence-free survival) ,  again a significant treatment advantage with 17-1A over control was obtained (P = .03 with Cox multivariate ,  and P = .05 with log-rank test for the umvariate analysis) .
Therefore ,  the proposition is holding up that treatment with 17-1A may preferentially act on isolated tumor cells and thus prevent outgrowth of distant metastases .
As shown in Table 2 ,  there is an excess of local recurrences in the treatment group ,  which may partially be explained by the longer survival of treated patients .
Toxicity .
Patients who developed recurrences and those who remained tumorfree did not show a difference in antibody titers .
The kinetics of the HAMA response in the two subgroups have been described in the 5-year report .
As will be reported elsewhere ,  the serum levels of antiidlotyplc antibodies (Ab2) showed no significant differences between the analyzed patients who remained tumor free (n = 30) or experienced a relapse (n = 30) .
DISCUSSION .
As the 7-year median follow-up data confirm the previously reported 5-year findings ,  the conclusion seems warranted that antibody treatment improves the chances of curatively operated patients .
Local recurrences may not affect the overall survival curve to the same degree as distant metastases do (Fig 3) ,  therefore ,  survival at 7 years appears to be superior to the disease-free interval .
It is noteworthy that in various reports ,  results recorded after a 5-year observation period do not necessarily hold up when patients are monitored for an additional time of 2 years .
While after 5 years of follow-up evaluation ,  a significant increase in disease-free and overall survival ofpatients was evident ,  after 2 further years ,  the overall survival did not show significance .
These findings were confirmed by another cooperative group .
Similar high doses were used in the lymphoma trial cited earlier .
On the other hand ,  the peculiar immunogenicity of the murine antibody may be important for the recruitment of human T cells as mediators of an indirect antitumor effect .
Direct tumoricidal effects are good candidates for the still controversial reaction mechanism of unconjugated antibodies .
These reactions are best explained by cytotoxic effects of the antibody on normal epithelial cells that bear the 17-1A antigen to a similar degree as tumor cells .
