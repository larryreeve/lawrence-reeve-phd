An analysis of the patterns of failure after radiation therapy in locally advanced cervical cancer reveals that of those who recur over 70% have some component of pelvic failure as the first site of relapse and two-thirds develop some component of distant disease .
These advantages include no delay in the start of definitive irradiation ,  no prolongation of overall treatment time (thus minimizing the theoretical risk of accelerated clonogen proliferation during the antineoplastic course) ,  and possible interaction of the concurrently administered chemotherapy with radiation through such mechanisms as inhibition of repair of radiation damage ,  cell synchronization ,  recruitment of nonproliferating cells into cell cycle ,  and reduction of the hypoxic fraction .
The optimal dosing schedule for maximizing cell kill with infusional 5-FU and radiation remains undefined ,  but laboratory data suggested greater effects with increasing dose and prolonged exposure to 5-FU and when drug was present for intervals in excess of 48 h after radiation .
Patients were randomized to receive either (a) standard external beam pelvic irradiation (EBRT) in a dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions defined at 100% versus ,  (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional intravenous 5-FU in a dose of 1 g/m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  (c) partially hyperfractionated RT ,  5280 cGy in 33 fractions ,  2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  or (d) arm (c) with the same infusional 5-FU .
For rare patients with disease extension to the lower one-third of vagina ,  the first application to the cervix and uterus was modified to deliver 30 Gy at 2 cm from the center of the sources and a second application as a line source in the vagina ,  was used to deliver a further 20 Gy at 0.5 cm depth from the surface of the vagina. 5-FU was given as an infusion from days 1 to 4 inclusive and on treatment days 22 to 25 inclusive .
In order to detect a 20% improvement in pelvic control rate from an expected 50% for arm (a) to 70% for arm (d) assuming an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.20 ,  73 patients in each of four treatment arms would be required for a total of 292 patients .
The median tumor size in stratum 1 of 6 cm was large despite the relatively earlier FIGO stage compared to stratum 2 .
However ,  in evaluating the importance of the contribution of the change in fractionation to the differences observed ,  there was no significant difference in the 5-year survival of those treated on standard radiation versus those treated with hyperfractionated irradiation whether or not 5-FU was used .
Since significant differences in pelvic control and survival were observed in stratum 1 which contained only 99 patients ,  it is important to examine whether there was an uneven distribution of other possible patient or tumor-related prognostic factors across the treatment arms to account for the differences observed .
The crude incidence of 5.9% (13 of 221) presents a good estimate of the overall risk for chronic bowel complications in survivors ,  since most occur in the first 3 years after radiation therapy .
However ,  in stratum 1 constituted of patients with stage IB/IIA and those IIB tumors with medial parametrial involvement ,  a significant improvement in both pelvic control and disease-free survival in favor of standard radiation with concurrent 5-FU was observed (Figs. 5 and 6) .
