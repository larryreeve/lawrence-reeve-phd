The results of that study are the focus of this report .
Patients were considered eligible for entry onto the study provided they had histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum and had undergone a surgical procedure at which time all gross tumor had been removed and no evidence of tumor had been present at the resection margins .
The distal edge of the primary tumor must have been <= 12 cm from the anal verge as measured by sigmoidoscopy with the patient in the knee-chest position .
For all other patients ,  inclusion of the perineum in the radiation field was at the discretion of the investigator .
All patients were to receive intravenous 5-FU 500 mg/m given in a rapid infusion on the first 3 days and last 3 days of radiation therapy .
After the completion of radiation therapy and 5-FU ,  nochemotherapy was given for 5 weeks .
Second and subsequent courses were to be given on the same schedule but with the dose of 5-FU increased to 325 mg/m intravenously ,  days 1 to 5,375 mg/m2 ,  days 36 to 40 ,  and MeCCNU to 130 mg/m orally on day 1 .
Courses were to be repeated at 10-week intervals for a totalof 18 months of treatment .
The first course of treatment for patients randomized to this arm consisted of 5-FU 350 mg/m intravenously given in a rapid infusion on days 1 to 5 .
This dose was not to be exceeded for the fifth and sixth courses .
Dose Reduction Criteria .
Separate criteria for dose reduction were specified for the two postradiation treatment arms .
Each course of treatment was not to be instituted until leukocyte counts were greater than 4,000/yLand platelet counts were above 150,000/UL .
Repetition of severe marrow depression (leukocyte count < 1,500/UL) or thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 25,000/UL) after dose reduction or persistent leukopenia (leukocyte count < 4,000/UL) or thrombocytopenia (< 100,000/UL) at 10 weeks after the last dose of MeCCNU disqualified a patient from any further treatment with MeCCNU .
Dose reduction criteria for the 5-FU escalating arm included no escalation if leukocyte count nadir was below 2,000/UL but at least 1,000/UL and platelet count nadir between 75,000/UL and 99,999/UL and a 25% reduction in the next course for leukocyte nadir below 1,000/UL and platelet count nadir below 75,000/UL .
Thomas.Deviations in dose and fractionation of up to 5% were considered satisfactory for protocol compliance .
Statistical Considerations .
Using the techniques of Makuch and Simon ,  it can be shown that a sample size of 100 patients per arm has an 80% power to exclude differences in treatments as great as .19 assuming a = .05 and a 30-month rate of .65 .
Probability distribution estimates of survival and disease-free survival were performed using the product-limit method of Kaplanand Meier .
All patients who died ,  regardless of disease status ,  were counted as events in the survival analysis .
The contribution of variables and treatment effect was tested using the proportional hazards procedures of Cox and the log-rank test .
Between March 1981 and November 1985 ,  210 patients were enrolled in this study ,  101 were randomized to the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen ,  and 109 to the escalating 5-FU arm .
Selected patient characteristics show that 58% had disease extension involving the perirectal fat with at least one positive lymph node ,  60% of patients are male ,  and 59% underwent an abdominal-perineal resection (Table 1) .
Central review of compliance with radiation therapy confirmed that the majority of patients were treated as per protocol ,  with discrepancies occurring equally in each treatment arm .
Toxicities experienced by patients on the two arms are comparable ,  53% of patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNUarm (52 of 99) and 50% of those assigned to the escalating 5-FU arm (54 of 107) experienced at least one episode of severe or worse toxicity as defined by the GITSG toxicity scale .
One patient on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm is reported to have died of complications of intestinal obstruction ,  although confirming evidence documenting this event is not available .
In three patients the small bowel obstruction appeared to occur at an anatomic site remote from the radiation field .
Of the 96 recurrent patients ,  10 died of disease without adequate documentation and were classified as recurrences by group review .
Significantly (P = .05) more recurrences involving distant sites have been documented on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm (40%) compared with the escalating 5-FU arm (26%) .
A total of 91 deaths have been reported ,  46% (44 of95) on 5-FU and MeCCNU and 45% (47 of 104) on 5-FU .
The RR for death associated with 5-FU and MeCCNU adjusted for stage ,  resection type ,  and distance to the nearest margin is 1.10 (95% CI , .68 to 1.52 ,  P = .67) .
As in the disease-free analysis ,  secondary analyses of survival considering either all patients randomized or only patients who received treatment after the completion of radiation therapy ,  resulted in no meaningful change in direction or magnitude of the RR attributed to treatment with the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen (RR = 1.10 ,  95% CI ,  .72 to 1.67 ,  and RR = 1.04 ,  95% CI ,  .65 to 1.67 ,  respectively) .
As expected ,  myelosuppression was the most common toxicity seen in both arms .
Although there were twice as many intestinal obstructions among patients receiving escalating 5-FU ,  no association with type of chemotherapy can be drawn from these small samples .
Because of toxicity ,  patients often received no therapy beyond the initial radiation treatment .
Different methods of 5-FU administration (eg ,  rapid infusion ,  prolonged continuous infusion) have been compared in an attempt to maximize radiation sensitization and further reduce the rate of locoregional recurrence .
Furthermore ,  studies in metastatic colorectal disease demonstrating enhanced efficacy of 5-FU when administered with leucovorin ,  as well as a recent report indicating a reduction in the rate of recurrence in colon cancer when levamisole was added to adjuvant 5-FU ,  have led to an intergroup trial assessing the value of such combinations as adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer (Intergroup Rectal Adjuvant protocol ,  Int 0114 ,  activated August 1990) .
