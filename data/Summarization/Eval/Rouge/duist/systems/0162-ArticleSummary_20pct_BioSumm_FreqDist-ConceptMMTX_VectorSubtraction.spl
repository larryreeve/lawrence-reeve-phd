SINCE JUNE 1973 ,  the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of CMF (cyclophosphamide ,  methotrexate ,  and fluorouracil) chemotherapy were evaluated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes .
The 7-yr results of this first program are now available , 6 and they confirm the benefit of CMFtreated patients (RFS 49.2%) as compared to women subjected to radical mastectomy alone (RFS 35.8% ,  p < 0.002) .
Among the numerous questions to be answered by current adjuvant studies is the optimal duration of treatment .
Similar findings were reported in the 4-yr analysis for the total patient population .
Between September 1975 and May 1978 ,  a total of 466 consecutive patients were entered into a prospective randomized study .
All patients were subjected to either Halsted or modified radical mastectomy ,  but a small fraction (16%) was subjected to extended radical mastectomy .
Adjuvant chemotherapy was started within 2-4 wk from mastectomy .
Of 466 patients entered into the study ,  7 premenopausal women were considered nonevaluable because of protocol violations .
In the presence of controversial radiologic findings ,  examinations were performed more often than originally planned .
RFS was considered as the time elapsed from the date of radical mastectomy to the first evidence of treatment failure .
RESULTS .
Results as Function of Treatment Programs .
In postmenopausal women with more than 3 nodes ,  the difference between CMF 12 (34.4%) and CMF 6 (54.9% ,  p = 0.18) is only apparent since the confidence-limits throughout the curve totally blurred the percent difference (standard error ,  or SE ,  at 5 yr ,  8.4 and 11.3 ,  respectively) .
Figure 2 shows the 5-yr total survival .
The same held true when findings were related to menopausal status .
In fact ,  premenopausal patients in the 12-cycle group had a 72% 5-yr survival compared to 77.1% for women in the 6-cycle group (p = 0.20) .
Site of First Relapse .
No difference in the pattern of treatment failure was evident between the treatment groups (Table 2) .
It is important to note that the frequency of local-regional recurrences ,  either alone or associated to distant metastases ,  was in the range of 8%-10% .
Table 3 details the findings observed at 5 yr from mastectomy .
Also ,  no difference was evident when overall survival of postmenopausal women was examined (ER+ 82.5% versus ER- 76.2% ,  p =0.32) .
By contrast ,  premenopausal women with ER + tumors had a significantly longer survival than their matches with ER- tumors (79.9% versus 67.6% ,  p = 0.03) .
Results as Function of Dose Levels of CMF .
The importance of the level of doses administered has been detailed in one of our previous reports. 4 A similar type of analysis was performed on patients entered into this study .
Table 5 presents the comparative frequency of second tumors between our first two CMF programs .
DISCUSSION .
The 5-yr results of the present study are now sufficiently mature to indicate with confidence that 6 cycles of CMF are equivalent to 12 cycles in terms of RFS and total survival .
In fact ,  in all variables examined ,  none of the two treatments under evaluation was significantly different from the other .
Low-dose CMF was applied only in 12 of 83 (14%) of the present 12-cycle group and in 6 of 52 (12%) of the 6-cycle group .
Thus ,  in the present study ,  only a small fraction of patients was started on drug doses that once more proved to be therapeutically ineffective .
A trend favoring postmenopausal versus premenopausal women given adjuvant combination chemotherapy was also observed by the NSABP group .
Effective adjuvant combination chemotherapy seems to be unaffected by ER status ,  at least when RFS is considered .
The fact that premenopausal women with ER + showed a significantlylonger survival than their matches with ER - tumors remains to be further evaluated .
Through the analysis of our results in advanced breast cancer treated with CMF ,  Skipper came to the conclusion that in clinically metastatic disease the nadir in surviving tumor cells is probably reached in the majority of patients in less than 6 cycles .
Briefly ,  all classes of drugs select and allow overgrowth of specifically drug-resistant neoplastic cells .
