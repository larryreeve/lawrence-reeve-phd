The treatment of choice for advanced cervical carcinoma has traditionally been radiotherapy alone .
From October 1990 to April 1995 ,  patients with advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix were entered on the study and randomly assigned to either radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy .
The trial compared the efficacy and tolerability of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer .
External beam irradiation was started on Day 1 and delivered using a linear accelerator of 10-MV photons to the whole pelvis using a four-field box technique .
Treatment was given using a remote-control afterloading system to give 430 cGy at point A in each intracavitary brachytherapy ,  as described previously .
Antiemetic treatment was given before and after cisplatinum-based chemotherapy .
Survival was defined as the observed length of life from protocol entry to death or until January 5 ,  1997 when the data analysis was finished and patients were still alive .
The actuarial disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with complete follow-up were estimated by the life-table method of Kaplan and Meier .
All eligible patients were included in the analysis regardless of whether they completed the assigned treatment .
Among them ,  60 patients were randomized to the concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy ,  62 were randomized to the radiotherapy alone .
The median follow-up was 46.8 months (range ,  12 ­ 69 months) .
Among them ,  interrupted radiotherapy with delayed treatment because of treatment-related toxicity was observed in 9 cases .
The duration of the unplanned interruption was 1 week in 5 and 2 weeks in 2 ,  and 2 patients were unable to complete the planned radiotherapy .
Of the radiotherapy group ,  60 patients completed radiotherapy with no delays of treatment for toxicity ,  whereas the planned radiotherapy was interrupted for 1 week in 2 patients because of radiation protitis or neutropenia .
However ,  there was no difference in completeness between concurrent group and radiotherapy group (96.7% versus 100% ,  P = 0.24) .
Acute (between initiation of therapy to 6 weeks after therapy) and late treatment-related toxicity (6 weeks after therapy) are listed in Tables 3 and 4 .
The acute treatment-related toxicity (grade 3 or 4) appears to be higher with the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group when compared with radiation group (36.7% versus 17.7% ,  P Å 0.02) .
No treatment-related deaths occurred in the radiotherapy group .
Additionally ,  there was also no difference in the incidence of distant failure between the chemoradiotherapy group and the radiotherapy group (21.6% versus 29% ,  P Å 0.47) .
Survival and Disease-Free .
Survival Of the chemoradiotherapy group ,  31 patients (51.7%) are alive without evidence of disease ,  6 (10%) remain alive with disease ,  and 21 (35%) died of disease at 7 ­ 48 months .
Regarding patients with treatment incompleteness ,  those two patients who did not complete their planned treatment course because of treatment-related toxicity were dead of disease at 13 and 16 months .
Of the 9 patients requiring treatment delays ,  7 patients (77.8%) died of disease (5) or are alive with disease (2) ,  whereas 18 of the 49 patients (36.7%) who had completed their planned treatment without treatment delays died of disease or are alive with disease .
Figures 1 and 2 show the 3-year disease-free and overall survival curves for the two groups .
Analysis by Kaplan ­ Meier method showed that the actuarial survival was not statistically different between the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups (mean survival time ,  38.1 months versus 41.5 months ,  P Å 0.27) .
Treatment results using radiation alone in women with locally advanced cervical cancer are unsatisfactory .
Therefore ,  the design of a more efficient treatment modality ,  such as the addition of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy ,  with the objective of increasing tumor control and long-term survival for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma ,  is advocated .
Our study also revealed that the patterns of recurrences were not changed by the concomitant therapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
Indeed ,  in our trial ,  the treatment-related toxicity was severe and resulted in delayed radiotherapy in 15% of patients after chemoradiotherapy ,  in which 77.8% of patients with treatment delays recurred or died of disease .
Additionally ,  the two patients who did not complete their planned treatment course died of disease .
In our trial ,  grade 3 or 4 treatment-related toxicities were observed more often on chemoradiotherapy than radiotherapy alone .
