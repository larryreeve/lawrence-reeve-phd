The first UK Medical Research Council (MRC) trial of preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer was a three-arm randomised trial with 824 patients comparing a control (surgery alone) group with a group treated with 20 Gy given in 10 equal fractions and another treated with a single exposure of 5 Gy .
These doses of radiation were chosen after trials by the Veterans Administration Surgical Adjuvant Group and the Princess Margaret Hospital ,  Toronto ,  suggested survival advantage with radiotherapy for patients with tumours of Dukes stage C .
Despite the suggestion of a real biological effect of the radiotherapy in the first MRC trial ,  with significant changes in tumour stage ,  no advantage was found for either radiotherapy group over the control group in terms of disease recurrence or survival .
Eligible patients were men or women younger than 80 years who ,  had histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum partially or totally fixed within the pelvis with the lower margin of the tumour within 15 cm of the anal verge ,  were deemed suitable and fit for the proposed treatment and available for regular follow-up ,  were free of disseminated disease (confirmed by clinical and radiological examination) ,  and had had no previous malignant disease .
Eligibility was confirmed and treatment allocated by minimisation on three factors ,  treatment centre ,  extension of tumour (fixed or partially fixed) ,  and intended operation (abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection) .
Criteria for suspicion of local recurrence were pain ,  increasing in severity and requiring medication ,  or disturbance of bladder function ,  induration in the perineum or pelvis on examination ,  or palpation of a mass in the pelvis or at the anastomosis .
Survival times were not censored at 5 years ,  all surviving patients have been flagged on the OPCS central register ,  and were presumed alive on Jan 1 ,  1995 .
We decided to continue the trial only until the launch ,  in November ,  1989 ,  of the UK Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research (UKCCCR) adjuvant X-ray and fluorouracil infusion study (AXIS) for treatment of colorectal cancer .
Nine patients received less than the prescribed dose of radiation ,  two received no radiotherapy because they were judged too ill ,  three failed to complete the full treatment because of their deteriorating condition ,  and treatment was stopped early in four patients (ischiorectal abscess and perineal breakdown ,  bowel obstruction ,  a prearranged time for surgery ,  and refusal to continue by the patient) .
A further five patients received slightly higher doses of radiation than planned to accommodate altered fractionation schedules .
Of patients who received radiotherapy ,  61 (45%) of 137 reported no significant morbidity. 45 (33%) of all patients suffered diarrhoea and 30 (22%) had skin reactions .
The median time from randomisation to surgery was 7 days (IQR 4.12 days) for patients allocated immediate surgery and 73 days (64.84) for those allocated preoperative radiotherapy .
The proportion of tumours graded as Dukes C was significantly lower in the radiotherapy group than in the surgery alone group (29 vs 59% ,  p.0.0002) and the number of involved lymph nodes was also smaller .
Complications associated with the colostomy were reported in ten surgery alone patients and eight radiotherapy patients ,  and five patients in each group had anastomosis-related complications after anterior restorative resection .
The hazard ratio is 0¡¤68 (95% CI of 0.47-0.98) ,  which suggests that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by a third .
The hazard ratio for death from any cause is 0.79 ,  giving an estimated reduction in the risk of death for patients allocated radiotherapy of 21% (log-rank p=0.10) .
However ,  cause-specific survival analysis suggests a larger benefit for radiotherapy .
Fewer deaths were reported to have been from colorectal cancer or complications of the disease or its treatment among patients allocated preoperative radiotherapy than among those allocated surgery alone (85 vs 103 ,  hazard ratio 0.71 [0.54-0.97] ,  p=0.02) .
The reasons for investigating preoperative radiation therapy were ,  reduction in size of the primary tumour and frequency of regional node metastases before resection ,  a reduction in the frequency of local pelvic recurrence and of distant metastasis from cancer cells released during resection (preoperative treatment can inhibit the proliferation of malignant cells whether they remain local or spread outside the pelvis after radiation) ,  radiation responsiveness of cancer cells may be greater before surgery when they are normally oxygenated than afterwards when they may be hypoxic because of surgical effects on the vasculature ,  and a lower frequency of late radiation enteritis because the small bowel is less likely to be adherent in the pelvis .
Patients in this subgroup have a much lower potential for curative surgery as well as a much poorer rate of survival even when curative surgery appeared to have been achieved .
Patients in the preoperative radiotherapy treatment group ,  in which a moderately high dose of radiation was to be used ,  had their surgery delayed by 2 months (1 month to cover the radiotherapy fractionation and a further month for tumour regression to occur and for the normal tissues to recover from the radiation) .
Several Swedish studies have advanced the case for the use of preoperative rather than postoperative radiation in terms of better patient compliance ,  greater reduction in local recurrence rates ,  and lower morbidity .
Moreover ,  current practice is to give a short course of high-dose radiation (25 Gy over 5.7 days) and to proceed to immediate surgery ,  thus avoiding the long delay before surgery .
The combined evidence from all these trials should yield sufficient numbers to answer precisely the questions of the effect of preoperative radiotherapy on local and distant recurrence ,  and above all the effect on survival .
