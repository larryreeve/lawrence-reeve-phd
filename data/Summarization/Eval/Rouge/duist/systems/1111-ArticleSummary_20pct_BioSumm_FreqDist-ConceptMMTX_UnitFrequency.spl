Additional risk factors for recurrence ,  e.g. ,  large tumor diameter (LTD) ,  deep stromal invasion (DSI) ,  and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces (CLS) found on microscopic examination have been only recently recognized and less extensively investigated than lymph node metastases .
Several authors proposed that patients with certain primary tumorrelated factors such as LTD ,  DSI ,  and CLS might also benefit from postoperative radiotherapy .
In 1988 the GOG initiated a prospective randomized study (GOG #92) ,  reported here ,  to investigate the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy for Stage I cervical cancer patients treated by conventional radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who were at high risk for recurrence ,  because of LTD ,  DSI ,  CLS ,  but excluding patients with lymph node metastases .
The GOG #92 multicenter prospective randomized study was designed to determine whether postoperative pelvic radiotherapy following radical hysterectomy and pelvic node dissection would reduce the rate of recurrence and decrease the mortality in Stage IB cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter ,  deep stromal invasion by tumor ,  and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces found on microscopic examination .
The revised sample size goal was 260 patients and the final analysis of recurrence-free interval would occur once 60 recurrences were observed .
Patients were eligible for the study if they had primary Stage IB squamous ,  adenosquamous carcinoma ,  or adenocarcinoma of cervix initially treated with a standard radical hysterectomy and who had negative lymph nodes but one of the previously described combination of risk factors .
Other eligibility criteria for enrollment into the study included normal blood counts ,  normal liver and kidney function ,  absence of genitourinary tract abnormality as determined by intravenous pyelogram ,  renal sonogram ,  or computerized tomography ,  and absence of intercurrent diseases or other conditions that might not permit completion of the study or the required follow-up .
After the eligibility criteria were verified ,  patients were randomly assigned to one of the two regimens ,  pelvic radiation or no further therapy .
Patients received external beam irradiation and no brachytherapy .
Patients were to be evaluated by physical examination ,  blood counts ,  blood chemistries ,  and chest x-rays ,  every 3 months during the first 2 years of follow-up ,  and every 6 months during the subsequent years .
The Radiotherapy Committee examined therapy forms ,  diagrams of irradiated fields ,  dosimetry curves ,  and portal fields for each external field .
Twenty-two patients were excluded ,  14 because of lack of documentation of high risk criteria ,  4 for wrong stage ,  1 for inadequate surgery ,  2 for inadequate pathology material for review ,  and 1 for not having an intravenous pyelogram or CT scan .
One hundred and fifty-one patients (55%) were white ,  56 (20%) were black ,  27 (10%) were Hispanic ,  and 21 (8%) were Asian .
There were 128 (46%) patients with the risk factors of positive CLS and deep one-third stromal invasion ,  65 (23%) had positive CLS ,  middle third stromal invasion and tumor size $2 cm ,  82 (30%) had negative CLS ,  middle or deep third stromal invasion and a $4-cm tumor ,  and 2 (0.7%) had positive CLS ,  superficial stromal invasion ,  and tumor size $5 cm (Table 3) .
Of the 137 patients randomized to radiotherapy ,  9 (6.6%) refused all radiotherapy and 6 (4.4%) refused to continue therapy after receiving less than 85% of the prescribed dose of 50.4 Gy (3.6 ,  3.6 ,  10.4 ,  14.4 ,  16.2 ,  and 36.0 Gy) .
One patient discontinued radiotherapy due to an adverse reaction after receiving 21.6 Gy .
Two other patients exceeded 20% protraction of treatment time due to an adverse reaction to the radiation requiring interruption of therapy .
The Cox model analysis indicated that when adjusting for all combinations of the three risk factors—tumor size ,  CLS ,  and the depth of invasion—the risk of recurrence was significantly reduced by 44% in the radiation group (P 5 0.019 ,  one-tail) .
Forty-eight patients have died as of this report (final analysis of survival awaits further follow-up until 60 deaths have occurred) .
Of those who are alive ,  six patients are lost-to-follow-up within the first year in the RT group while one is lost in the NFT group .
In an attempt to evaluate the impact of this imbalance ,  the log–rank test was recalculated assuming the first five patients lost (the excess number) in the RT group recurred at the time of their last clinical evaluation .
Nine (7.0%) of the 128 patients who received radiotherapy had 11 episodes of grade 3 (severe) or 4 (life-threatening) adverse effects compared to 3 (2.1%) from the NFT group .
One patient with severely decreased bladder volume required a permanent Indiana pouch urinary conduit for relief of urinary incontinence .
The formula combining the three risk factors that we used to determine patient eligibility may appear complicated .
A detailed GOG clinical pathologic study had established that certain patients with poor prognostic factors related to the primary tumor (i.e. ,  large tumor size ,  deep stromal invasion ,  and capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement) but without lymph node involvement had a risk of recurrence of 31% after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy .
The present prospective randomized study showed that adjunctive radiotherapy significantly reduced the number of cancer recurrences in women with the above risk factors by 44% and that the difference in recurrences between irradiated and nonirradiated patients was statistically significant at the P 5 0.019 level .
However ,  caution must be observed due to the disproportionately higher number of patients that are “lost to followup” among those receiving radiation therapy and the need for further follow-up to determine what impact radiation therapy has on survival .
The GOG attempted to conduct a randomized radiotherapy trial for women with positive nodes ,  but could not complete the study because of failure to enroll a sufficient number of patients (unpublished GOG data) .
Increased morbidity in patients receiving full course radiotherapy following radical surgery for cervical cancer has been reported .
In our study ,  major lifethreatening adverse effects were encountered in 5 (4%) womenamong the 128 who received radiotherapy .
