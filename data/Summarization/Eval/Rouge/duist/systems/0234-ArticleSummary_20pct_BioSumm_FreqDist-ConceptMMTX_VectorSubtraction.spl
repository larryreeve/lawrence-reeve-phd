It possesses a broad spectrum of clinical antitumor efficacy and is the most active nonhormonal drug for the treatment of breast cancer .
Its use ,  however ,  is limited by cumulative ,  dose-dependent ,  chronic cardiotoxicity .
It is a stereoisomer of DOX in which the hydroxyl group at the 4' position of the aminosugar side chain is epimerized (Fig 1) .
Patients with clinical evidence of active cardiac disease or a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of < 50% by RNCA were excluded .
Study DesignAfter determining eligibility ,  informed consent was obtained .
Duration of response was measured from the first day of initiation of therapy until progressive disease was  documented .
Clinical examination was performed prior to each dose of anthracycline .
RNCA was done with thepatients in supine position at rest and during maximum symptom limited bicycle exercise .
LVEF was determined by computer-assisted analysis of left ventricular time-activity curves .
Imaging was obtained for three minutes at the point of maximal tolerable exercise .
Therefore ,  for this study laboratory cardiac toxicity was defined as decrease in resting LVEF of > 10% from pretreatment baseline or a decrease in LVEF with stress of > 5% from the resting baseline obtained on the same day .
In the case of DOX ,  at a cumulative dose of  50 mg/m2 patients were offered the option to discontinue therapy or to continue with close monitoring of cardiac function with RNCA .
Several other comparisons ,  such as percent of projected dose ,  used the two-sample Wilcoxon test .
All hypothesis tests were two-sided .
The characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1 .
Although all patients had received prior chemotherapy which included cyclophosphamide or other alkylating agent ,  no patient had been previously treated with mitomycin C .
Complete responses were not observed in either arm .
Six (25%) of the 24 evaluable patients treated with EPI and seven (25%) of the 28 evaluable patients on the DOX arm achieved PRs .
This patient had been extensively treated with radiation and chemotherapy before treatment on this protocol .
Other common toxicities included nausea ,  vomiting ,  and alopecia .
Nausea or vomiting was documented in 58% of patients who received EPI and 67% of the patients who were treated with DOX .
In general ,  the nausea and vomiting in patients on the EPI arm was less severe .
All patients are included in the analysis of cardiotoxicity .
These data were also analyzed taking into consideration the difference in myelosuppressive potency between the two drugs .
Thus ,  all EPI doses were multiplied by 52/85 to compare the two drugs in equivalent units ,  and Kaplan-Meier estimates plotted (Fig 2B) .
The difference remains statistically significant with a P value of .04 .
A decrease in LVEF of > 5% with stress was not observed in the absence of a > 10% decrease in resting LVEF from baseline .
This sometimes ,  but not always ,  occurred  before the development of symptomatic congestive cardiomyopathy .
Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the cardiotoxic effects of DOX .
The optimal method for monitoring the cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines is controversial .
However ,  RNCA alone has also been useful in studying anthracycline cardiotoxicity .
Although endomyocardial biopsy is probably the definitive measure of cardiac injury ,  RNCA has the advantage of being noninvasive and ,  therefore ,  acceptable to virtually all patients in a randomized study of antineoplastic agents .
It was also similar to the combined experience in the literature with DOX as a single agent in previously treated women with breast cancer .
The design of these studies differed ,  however .
In the other single agent study ,  in which there was an empiric dose limitation of 600 mg/m2 ,  none of the seven EPItreated patients who had RNCA experienced a decline in LVEF of > 10% .
In the multidrug study ,  no clinical cardiac dysfunction was seen in the EPI-containing (FEC) arm .
In the multidrug study ,  therapy was discontinued in seven patients on the DOX-containing (FAC) arm because of cardiac dysfunction ,  including three with heart failure .
Thus ,  while assessment of LVEF by RNCA was useful in quantitating changes in cardiacfunction for the purposes of this study ,  it cannot be recommended for routine monitoring of individual patients as a predictor of impending cardiac failure .
This patient had shown a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction and was included in the analysis of laboratory cardiac toxicity .
She developed evidence of laboratory cardiotoxicity after a cumulative dose of 615 mg/m of DOX .
