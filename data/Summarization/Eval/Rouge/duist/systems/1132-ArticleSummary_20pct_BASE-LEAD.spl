ALTHOUGH much progress has been made in the early detection and control of carcinoma of the cervix since the introduction of  the Papanicolau test ,  it is estimated that about 13,500 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 1990 in  the United States with 6,000 patients dying from the disease .
The incidence is even more pronounced in developing countries  where carcinoma of the cervix is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in females ,   with the majority of the patients  presenting with advanced disease .
While surgery and radiotherapy (RT) are equally effective in early-stage disease ,  radiation  therapy has been the primary treatment modality for stage III disease ,  with 5-year survival rates between 30% to 45% being  reported.4-8 Attempts to improve these results ,  including the use of hypoxic cell sensitizers ,  hyperbaric oxygen therapy , '0  and neutron therapy" have met with limited or no success .
The role of chemotherapy (CT) ,  either as a single agent or in  combination ,  has been extensively evaluated in advanced or recurrent disease .
Response rates ranging from 0% to 90% have been  reported but are usually of short duration .
Vogl et al and Alberts et al using a combination of bleomycin ,  vincristine ,   mitomycin ,  and cisplatin (BOMP) in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent disease reported high response rates (> 20% of  the patients with a complete response [CR]) with acceptable toxicity .
Because of the high remission rate ,  these authors felt  this combination should be used as a front-line treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer .
The use of upfront CT as  initial treatment before pelvic RT would be theoretically advantageous as the vascular supply to the tumor is not  compromised ,  allowing a higher local tissue concentration of drugs ,  thereby improving the effectiveness of CT .
To test this  hypothesis ,  we began in 1984 at the Instituto Nacional de Cancer (Rio de Janeiro ,  Brazil) a prospective randomized trial  comparing neoadjuvant BOMP CT followed by pelvic RT (CT + RT) versus pelvic RT alone in patients with stage IIIB carcinoma of  the cervix .
Here we report the results of this study .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Patient Entry Criteria and Evaluation .
Between April 1984 and August 1986 ,  107 previously untreated patients with stage III B carcinoma of the cervix were entered  on the study .
Eligibility criteria consisted of a histopathologic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma ,  age younger than 70  years with no past history of malignancy ,  the lower third of the vagina free of disease ,  and a performance status greater  than 50% in the Karnofsky scale .
Patients also needed to have adequate medullary reserve (WBC Ž 4,000/IpL ,  platelet count >  100,000/p.L) and normal renal (BUN < 8.9 mmol/L ,  creatinine < 130 Rimol/L ,  creatinine clearance > 1.17 mL/s) and liver  (alkaline phosphatase < 110 U/L ,  bilirubin < 21 pimol/L) function .
Staging evaluation included a complete medical history and  physical examination ,  cystoscopy ,  chest x-ray ,  bipedal lymphangiogram ,  intravenous (IV) pyelogram ,  complete blood counts ,  and  biochemistries .
Computed tomographic scans were not routinely performed .
Clinical assessment of tumor extension was performed  by two investigators ,  and a pretreatment gynecologic examination under anesthesia was not required .
The International  Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging criteria were used in this study .
Patients with lymphangiographic findings of  pelvic or paraaortic nodal disease were not excluded .
No patient underwent lymph node biopsy to confirm the radiologic  findings .
The trial was performed after approval by local institutional ethics committee .
All patients gave written consent  before entry into the trial .
Fifty-two patients were randomized to the CT + RT arm and 55 to the RT arm .
Of these ,  16 were excluded from this analysis .
In  the CT + RT group ,  11 refused further therapy ,  including pelvic RT ,  after only one cycle of CT ,  and two others were found to  have abnormal renal function after randomization and before commencement of treatment .
Three in the RT arm refused further  treatment after only a few fractions of irradiation were delivered .
Thus ,  there were 39 assessable patients in the CT + RT  arm and 52 in the RT arm .
The groups were balanced for age ,  extension of parametrial disease ,  lymph node involvement ,   hemoglobin level ,  bulkiness of the cervical disease ,  and the presence of hydronephrosis .
Patient characteristics are outlined  in Table 1 .
Treatment Regimens .
Radiation therapy was delivered using an 18 MeV photon linear accelerator .
The radiation therapy was administered using an  isocentric technique via a pair of parallel opposed anterior and posterior ports .
