Pretreatment evaluation included a complete medical history and physical examination ,  complete blood count ,  serum electrolytes ,  chemistry profile ,  tumor markers ,  chest X ray ,  an electrocardiogram ,  and contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis .
Extraperitoneal staging laparotomy was performed if aspiration cytology was negative .
In the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group ,  chemotherapeutic regimens consisted of cisplatin (50 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously at the rate of 1 mg/min on Day 1) ,  vincristine (1 mg/m2 intravenously push on Day 2) ,  and bleomycin (25 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously infusion in divided doses on Days 2 ,  3 ,  and 4) which were given starting on Day 1 of radiotherapy and then every 3 weeks for a total of four courses .
The primary objectives were to compare the two treatment groups with respect to tumor response ,  failure patterns ,  disease-free interval ,  and actuarial survival .
At a two-sided P value of 0.05 ,  with the use of a Pearson x2 approximation ,  the estimated power was 80% an improvement of 25% in survival with the concurrent therapy at the a Å 0.05 level (two-sided test) .
Therefore ,  in an attempt to improve tumor control and survival in patients with advanced cervical carcinoma ,  the treatment efficacy and tolerability of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy using cisplatin-based chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer needs to be explored .
The published trials in advanced cervical carcinoma with concurrent chemoradiotherapy ,  either a single-agent weekly cisplatin or in combination with cisplatin ­ 5-FU or cisplatin ­ bleomycin ­ vincristine ,  yield tumor response rates of approximately 80% ,  and 3-year survival rates reached 50 to 60% of patients .
To further increase the systemic activity and the radiation-enhancing potential of the chemotherapy ,  we chose cisplatin-based regimens with vincristine and bleomycin in this trial because it had proven high efficacy of local control in our previous phase I and II trials for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
