Purpose ,  As previously shown ,  antibody treatment increased survival of patients with resected colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C .
Conclusion ,  The now-matured study shows that 17-1A antibody administered after surgery prevents the development of distant metastasis in approximately one third of patients .
In brief ,  patients were staged after surgery and had a chest radiogram and abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography scan .
Therefore ,  it is now named eplthehal cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) .
Survival .
After 7 years ,  a total of 87 deaths were observed in 166 eligible patients .
The death rate of the observed group was 63% (48 of 76 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  48 to 78) of patients and that of the treated group was 43% (39 of 90 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  31 to 58) .
The calculated recurrence rate was 68% (49 of 76 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  53 to 82) m the control group and 52% (47 of 90 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  39 to 67) in the 17-1A group .
In this analysis ,  data on patients who died without recurrence were censored .
Pattern of Recurrence .
Therefore ,  the proposition is holding up that treatment with 17-1A may preferentially act on isolated tumor cells and thus prevent outgrowth of distant metastases .
As shown in Table 2 ,  there is an excess of local recurrences in the treatment group ,  which may partially be explained by the longer survival of treated patients .
There were no late treatment-related fatalities or life-threatening conditions ,  or any evidence for chronic drug-related side effects .
Immune Response to 17-1A Antibody .
When tested for antibody response against murine antibody (HAMA) ,  80% of treated patients developed a distinct HAMA response after the second or third nfusion .
The kinetics of the HAMA response in the two subgroups have been described in the 5-year report .
DISCUSSION .
The conclusion seems warranted that some of the treated patients ,  who have not yet recurred ,  may indeed be cured .
The conspicuous inefficacy of the antibody on local recurrences (Fig 4) may account for the smaller P values in the disease-free-interval analysis .
These findings were confirmed by another cooperative group .
This finding lends some support to the concept of long-lasting dormancy in early disseminated tumor cells .
The dose of antibody chosen deserves a special comment .
In the planning stage of the trial ,  we were afraid of a strong anaphylactic response to repeated adnumstration of murine immunoglobulin .
We therefore resorted to a large ,  first intravenous dose that consisted of 500 mg highly soluble monomeric mmunoglobulin G2a to induce tolerance to mouse mmunoglobulin G .
Thus far ,  this assay has been negative .
However ,  it may be insufficient to determine only a humoral antiidiotype response .
Thus far ,  in murine systems ,  breaking of tolerance against autoantigens via the antildotype route has not yet been shown in an unambiguous fashion .
By double staining of individual metastatic cells in bone marrow ,  It was shown that the 17-lA target is expressed by disseminated cells in only two thirds of the examined patients .
Therefore ,  in anticipation of antigenic heterogeneity ,  a combination therapy that consists of antibodies of different specificities may forestall a selection of antigen-negative cells exerted inevitably by a one-antibody approach .
They do not only possess extended serum half-lives ,  but also harness human effector mechanisms much more efficiently than murine immunoglobulihns can do .
On the other hand ,  the peculiar immunogenicity of the murine antibody may be important for the recruitment of human T cells as mediators of an indirect antitumor effect .
