Results .
Conclusion .
Therefore ,  our data favor an intensified treatment in similar cases .
The first generation of randomized adjuvant trials have recently been reviewed and a meta-analysis performed on the basis of updated patient records .
The time of the analysis (November ,  1999) was 36 months after the last randomization .
PATIENTS AND METHODS .
Study Design and Staging .
All the patients gave their informed written consent before the randomization .
Selection Criteria .
Local Treatment .
Adjuvant Treatment .
Toxicity and Follow-Up .
Statistical Considerations .
RESULTS .
The present article deals with a minimum observation time of 36 months calculated from the date of randomization of the last patient (11 of 96) .
Local Treatment .
Chemotherapy and Toxicity .
The mean administered doses of the fifth cycle (94 mg of EPI and 8,156 mg of IFO) were slightly lower than those of the fourth cycle (95.5 mg of EPI and 8,257 mg of IFO) .
Follow-Up Data .
All deaths except one (in the control arm) were disease related .
Intention-To-Treat Analysis for Survival .
Overall DFS .
Table 4 lists these events .
In four patients ,  the first event was a synchronous local relapse with metastases (one patient in the control arm and three patients in the treatment arm) .
Local DFS .

Metastasis-Free Survival .

OS .
Patients died from uncontrolled metastatic disease .
DISCUSSION .
Adjuvant treatment of localized soft tissue sarcomas is controversial because no sufficient and convincing data are available .
The toxicity of the program was not negligible .
This P value was reached ,  and the protocol was closed .
Moreover ,  this treatment option5,32,33 was chosen for those patients presenting with locally far-advanced disease or with disease approaching critical structures (nerves and vessels) ,  therefore a high incidence of local relapse could be foreseen .
The outcome of the untreated patient group was worse than that of previous trials .
The present trial deals with data obtained at a median follow-up time of 59 months and 36 months after last randomization .
