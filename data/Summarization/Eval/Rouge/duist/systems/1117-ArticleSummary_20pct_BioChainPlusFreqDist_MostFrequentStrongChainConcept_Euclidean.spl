Stage Ib and IIa carcinoma of the cervix can be cured by radical surgery or radiotherapy with similar effectiveness ,  but the rate and types of complications differ .
Radiotherapy is feasible and effective in almost all patients ,  5-year survival after this therapy ranges from 78% to 91% .
Apart from Newton’s study about stage-I diseases ,  there have been no randomised studies to compare radiotherapy with radical surgery in one institution over a short period of time .
Eligibility criteria were ,  age 30–70 years ,  newly diagnosed stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  no concurrent or previous malignant disease ,  WHO performance status of 1 or less ,  and feasibility of both radical surgery and radiotherapy .
The treatments in thetable were coded so that no-one could discover treatment allocation before randomisation .
Radiotherapy included ,  external pelvic irradiation with 18 MV photon beam by the multiportal technique ,  one dose of 1·8–2·0Gy at the isocentre ,  and two or more portals treated daily .
After 2 weeks ,  one caesium-137 LDR insertion was carried out .
Radical surgery consisted of a class III radical abdominal hysterectomy ,  as described by Piver and co-workers .
In patients aged 40 years or younger with squamous histology ,  one ovary was preserved and suspended to the ipsilateral paracolic space outside the pelvis .
Adjuvant radiotherapy consisted of external pelvic irradiation (18 MV X-rays) with the multiportal technique ,  one fraction of 1·8–2·0 Gy daily ,  with a total dose of 50·4 Gy over 5–6 weeks .
We classified complications as ,  grade 1 ,  mild symptoms not affecting the patient’s health and easily cured ,  grade 2 ,  symptoms that can be resolved by long-term medical therapies ,  grade 3 ,  major symptoms that require surgery or invasive procedures and affect the performance status of the patient ,  or fatal complications .
Of the 468 patients with FIGO stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  125 were excluded because of age (<30 years ,  >70 years ,  n=43) ,  medical illness (n=54) ,  previous or concurrent malignant disease (n=21) ,  or the referring physician’s or patient’s preference for surgery ,  radiotherapy ,  or chemoradiotherapy (n=7) .
After randomisation ,  there were six protocol violations ,  two in the surgery group (one progression before operation and one refusal of any therapy after randomisation) and four in the radiotherapy group (two patients whose cancer was incorrectly staged and two with synchronous neoplasia) .
Three patients with recurrence died of intercurrent disease (one after successful treatment of the recurrence) .
The median time to recurrence did not differ significantly between the surgery and radiotherapy groups (20 vs 18 months ,  p=0·24). 82% of pelvic recurrences and 61% of the distant ones became evident within 2 years of the primary treatment .
Three (1·7%) surgery-group patients had perioperative complications ,  one vascular lesion during lymphadenectomy ,  one postoperative ureterovaginal fistula ,  and one fatal pulmonary embolism .
The relative risk of this complication for surgery plus radiotherapy versus surgery alone was 3·11 (95% CI 0·71–13·56) and was 2·01 (95% CI 0·84–4·8%) for surgery plus radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone .
Morley and Seski’s study ,  of 446 patients with stage-Ib disease recruited between 1945 and 1975 and treated with radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy or external irradiation and brachyradiotherapy ,  reported crude 5-year survival of 87% and 83% ,  respectively .
Furthermore ,  surgery allows the status of the lymph nodes ,  the most dependent variable associated with survival ,  to be assessed accurately .
By contrast ,  radiotherapy is easier to deliver for patients who are obese ,  are elderly ,  or have severe illness—major contraindications to the surgical approach .
Radiotherapy also avoids the risks of anaesthesia and the laparotomy scar ,  and iatrogenic mortality is rare .
Complications after radiotherapy arise later than after surgery ,  although radiotherapy-related complications are often permanent .
In Italy ,  a prospective randomised trial has been under way since 1993 to assess the best adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) for high-risk patients after radical surgery for FIGO stage Ib–IIa cancer .
Improvements in local control and survival could be achieved by combined treatments ,  which would avoid the discomforting complications associated with surgery plus radiotherapy .
Most women with stage Ib–IIa cervical cancer can be treated successfully with radiotherapy ,  whereas a judicious selection of patients is necessary before planning primary radical surgery .
Histological type should be included in the selection criteria ,  because our data show that radiotherapy was less effective than surgery for adenocardinoma of the cervix .
This finding should resolve some of the conflicting approaches to this issue.14–16 Our results suggest that the optimum candidates for primary radical surgery are women with normal ovarian function and cervical diameters of 4 cm or smaller ,  whereas radiotherapy is preferable for postmenopausal women .
Women whose cervical diameters are larger than 4 cm should be identified before surgery so that they can benefit from tailored treatment ,  radical radiotherapy ,  with the option of concomitant radiosensitising chemotherapy to improve the local control of the disease ,  or cisplatinbased chemotherapy followed by radical surgery .
The latter approach offers the advantages of surgery ,  and the neoadjuvant chemotherapy will keep to a minimum the risk of extracervical spread of the tumour withoutcombining surgery and radiotherapy .
