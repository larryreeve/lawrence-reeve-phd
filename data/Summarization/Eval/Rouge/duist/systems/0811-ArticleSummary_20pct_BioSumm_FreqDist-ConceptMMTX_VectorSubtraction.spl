ADVANCED colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common oncologic challenges encountered in the Western world .
These responses are usually partial ,  sometimes questionable ,  and generally very transient .
A hope frequently pursued in clinical research has been that the activity of 5-FU can be enhanced either by adding the activity of other cytotoxic drugs or ,  more recently ,  by favorably modulating the effects of 5-FU itself .
Although enhanced activity by such methods has occasionally been suggested in pilot studies or in phase 2 trials ,  these claims have seldom been substantiated by the essential definitive study-a randomized comparison with 5-FU used alone .
The purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate ,  by such a randomized and controlled comparison ,  a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5-FU activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials .
These effects presumably occur through the action of thymidine in blocking oxidative metabolism of 5-FU and increasing 5-FU incorporation into RNA .
Synergistic activity with the PALA-5-FU combination was demonstrated in murine tumor systems .
Again it would seem appropriate that the activity and toxicity of the MOF-Strept combination be placed in perspective by a randomized comparison with 5-FU alone .
On days 2 through 5 ,  5-FU was administered after PALA. but no delay was required .
Levamisole was administered orally at a dose of 50 mg every 8 hours on days 14 ,  15. and 16 ,  and days 21. 22. and 23 of each 5- FU cycle .
This corresponded to the regimen used by Davis et al .
Vincristine was administered by rapid IV injection at a dose of I mg/m 2 on days I and 36 .
This corresponded to the method used by the New York Memorial group .
For all regimens .
WBC count and platelet counts were obtained weekly .
It was required that this result be observed at least 4 weeks after the onset of therapy ,  but there was no requirement for duration of response .
P values were two-sided .
Early termination did not occur .
A total of 347 patients were randomized on this study .
A total of 335 eligible patients were properly started on therapy and are included in the analysis below .
These represent 97% of all patients randomized .
The pretreatment characteristics of our patients are displayed according to the treatment arm in Table 1 .
It is noteworthy that most of these patients were in excellent general condition .
One patient died in irreversible coma .
Therapeutic Results .
The intervals to disease progression are shown in Fig 1 .
There was no suggestion that any of the combination regimens performed in a superior fashion to 5-FU used alone ,  and it is unlikely that any could produce as much as a 50% increase in time to progression (P < .05) for each regimen v 5-FU alone .
This was confirmed by a stratified Cox analysis ,  adjusting for key prognostic covariates ,  which indicated that the data were inconsistent with any combination regimen yielding a 50% increase in survival relative to 5-FU (ie ,  a hazard ratio of 1 .5) ,  wherefore 5-FU plus PALA ,  P < .01 ,  5-FU plus thymidine ,  P < .0001 ,  5-FU plus levamisole ,  P < .01 ,  and MOF-Strept ,  P < .05 .
In each of the regimens we tested ,  drug dosages and scheduling were admittedly largely arbitrary .
It is entirely possible that different proportionate representation of drug dosages or different scheduling could produce more favorable or less favorable results than we observed .
Unfortunately ,  there is little in the way of reliably predictable animal model experimentation to serve as a foundation for rational dosage regimens in humans .
This allowed for 60% of the full dose of both 5-FU and PALA to be administered .
