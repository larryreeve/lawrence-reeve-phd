ALTHOUGH MANY PATIENTS with carcinoma of the uterine cervix are cured with local measures ,  a substantial minority recur or present with metastases and are potential candidates for systemic therapy .
Unfortunately , the list of active drugs is short and combinations have not shown a consistent improvement over single agents .
Cisplatin is said to be the most active anticancer drug in cervical cancer ,  although 100 mg/m did not significantly improve the complete response (CR) rate compared prospectively with 50 mg/m (12.7 v 10% ,  respectively) and there was no appreciable difference in response duration ,  progression-free interval (PFI) ,  or survival.Thus ,  there is no convincing reason to use a cisplatindose higher than 50 mg/m .
Mitolactol (dibromodulcitol) is a hexitol derivative thatis converted into dianhydrogalactitol (DAG) in humanserum .
DAG is probably an alkylating agent .
Previousstudies have shown activity for both DAG and mitolactol in cervical cancer .
A phase II study of the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) demonstrated activity formitolactol as a single agent in cervical cancer using 180mg/m/d for 10 days by mouth in repeated 4-week cycles.There were 55 assessable patients ,  with one CR and 15 partial responses (PRs) (29% response rate) .
The principal toxicity of mitolactol is hematologic ,  while that of cisplatin is nonhematologic .
Since both drugs have activityin cervical cancer ,  it seemed reasonable to evaluate this combination .
The combination of DAG and cisplatin has previously been studied .
Since there were only 18 assessable patients , the study was too small for definitive conclusions .
Nevertheless ,  the possibility existed that the combination ,  with two CRs and five PRs (39% response rate) ,  produced improved results .
A pilot study used mitolactol plus cisplatin and established a tolerable dose schedule of 180 mg/m of mitolactoldaily for 5 days with cisplatin 50 mg/m .
Although an intermediate dose level (50 mg/m cisplatin and 225mg/m mitolactol daily for 5 days) was considered ,  it wasnot pursued ,  since six of 10 patients at the first dose level in the pilot study required dose reductions and/or delays with re-treatment .
Ifosfamide is a new agent closely related to cyclophosphamide ,  but with less marrow toxicity and more bladder toxicity that requires concomitant use of the uroprotectormesna .
Treatment of cervix cancer with the combination of ifosfamide ,  cisplatin ,  and bleomycin yielded a 69% response rate (49 patients) in one series .
The result was impressive ,  but the importance of bleomycin was unclear and its toxicity sometimes troublesome ,  so we proposed to compare cisplatin alone versus a regimen of cisplatinplus mitolactol (C + M) and a regimen of cisplatin plusifosfamide (and mesna) (CIFX) .
PATIENTS AND METHODS .
Eligible patients included women with histologically confirmed advanced (stage IVB) ,  recurrent ,  or persistent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix not suitable for curative treatment with surgery and/or radiotherapy .
Written informed consent was obtained before study entry .
Lesions measurable by physical examination or chest x-ray were required .
Measurements by computed tomography (CT) scan were accepted if the lesion was > 3 cm and sharply defined .
