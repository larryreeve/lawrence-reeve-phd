Fifty-four patients with advanced breast cancer who had failed prior nonanthracycline combination chemotherapy were randomized to treatment with either epirubicin 85 mg/m2 or doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 intravenously every three weeks .
Of 52 evaluable patients ,  25% (six of 24) treated with epirubicin ,  and 25% (seven of 28) treated with doxorubicin experienced major therapeutic responses .
The median duration of response to epirubicin was 11.9 months compared to 7.1 months with doxorubicin .
Cardiotoxicity was monitored by serial multigated radionuclide cineangiocardiography performed at rest and after exercise .
Laboratory evidence of cardiotoxicity was defined as a decrease in resting left ventricular ejection fraction of > 10% from the baseline value ,  or a decrease of 5% or greater with exercise compared with the resting study performed on the same day .
Fifteen patients treated with epirubicin and 18 patients treated with doxorubicin had at least two determinations of left ventricular ejection fraction and were evaluable for laboratory cardiotoxicity .
Using methods of survival analysis ,  the median doses to the development of laboratory cardiotoxicity were estimated to be 935 mg/m2 of epirubicin and 468 mg/m2 of doxorubicin .
Four patients treated with epirubicin and five treated with doxorubicin developed symptomatic congestive heart failure .
The median cumulative dose at which congestive heart failure occurred was 1,134 mg/m2 of epirubicin compared with 492 mg/m2 of doxorubicin .
Fewer episodes of nausea and vomiting were observed in patients receiving epirubicin .
Epirubicin is a new anthracycline with reduced cardiac toxicity ,  but preserved efficacy in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer .
DOXORUBICIN (DOX) ,  or Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories ,  Columbus ,  Ohio) ,  is one of the most useful antineoplastic agents available .
It possesses a broad spectrum of clinical antitumor efficacy and is the most active nonhormonal drug for the treatment of breast cancer .
Its use ,  however ,  is limited by cumulative ,  dose-dependent ,  chronic cardiotoxicity .
In retrospective studies ,  the incidence of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) was estimated to be approximately 3% to 4% after a cumulative DOX dose of 450 mg/m2 and 6% to 10% after 550 mg/m2 ,  the incidence of CHF rises steeply after higher cumulative doses.On the basis of these retrospective studies ,  an empiric dose limitation of 450 to 550 mg/m2 has been recommended when DOX is used on a standard every three week schedule .
More recently ,  however ,  subclinical cardiac injury has been documented at considerably lower doses .
Cardiac monitoring with noninvasive techniques and endomyocardial biopsy identifypatients being treated with DOX who have asymptomatic functional or morphologic cardiac abnormalities and who may be at high risk for the development of clinical congestive cardiomyopathy .
Discontinuation of therapy in these patients may prevent cardiac failure ,  but also results in curtailment of the antineoplastic effect of DOX .
One approach to solving this problem is the development of DOX analogues that retain antineoplastic activity but possess reduced potential for cardiac damage .
Preclinical studies suggest that this may be possible by structural alteration of the anthracyline molecule .
Epirubicin (4'-epi-doxorubicin ,  EPI) is one such compound .
It is a stereoisomer of DOX in which the hydroxyl group at the 4' position of the aminosugar side chain is epimerized (Fig 1) .
The antitumor activity of EPI in animal models is similar to that of DOX ,  but EPI is a less toxic compound with regard to both cytotoxicity and cardiac injury .
In the mouse ,  EPI and DOX have similar patterns of distribution to various tissues ,  although drug levels are lower in heart and spleen with EPI .
Pharmacokinetic studies in tumor-bearing mice and rats indicate that EPI is more extensively metabolized by liver than DOX .
The two compounds have similar pharmacokinetic behavior in humans ,  although EPI is eliminated more rapidly .
In two clinical phase I studies ,  EPI was found to have acceptable toxicity at doses of 85 to 90 mg/m2 given intravenously (IV) every three weeks .
The acute toxicity was qualitatively similar to that seen with DOX .
Therapeutic responses were observed in patients with advanced breast cancer in both studies .
Before an analogue of an active drug is accepted for clinical use ,  its toxicity and efficacy should be compared with that of the established compound .
We used multigated radionuclide cineangiocardiography (RNCA) to assess cardiac toxicity in this prospective ,  randomized study comparing the efficacy ,  acute ,  and chronic toxicities of EPI with DOX in patients with advanced breast cancer .
MATERIALS AND METHODSPatient EligibilityThis study was conducted in patients with advanced breast cancer who had progressed after receiving combination chemotherapy .
Patients whose prior treatment included an anthracycline were excluded from this study .
Other criteria for eligibility included a performance status of - 50% (Karnofsky scale) ,  a WBC count - 4,000/14L ,  a platelet count >- 100,000/L ,  normal serum bilirubin levels ( < 1.5 mg/dL) ,  and objectively evaluable or measurable disease .
Patients with clinical evidence of active cardiac disease or a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of < 50% by RNCA were excluded .
Pretreatment Evaluation and Follow-up Studies Pretreatment evaluation of patients included complete history and physical examination ,  complete blood cell count (CBC) ,  12-channel biochemical profile ,  serum creatinine ,  chest roentgenogram ,  ECG ,  and bone scan .
Areas of increased uptake on bone scan were further studied with roentgenograms to determine the nature of the abnormalities .
Liver scans were done only if there was elevation of the hepatic enzymes on the biochemical profile .
Blood counts were initially monitored weekly ,  and then less frequently after the pattern of myelosuppression was established .
Biochemical profiles were repeated every six weeks .
All evaluable or measurable parameters of disease were reevaluated at least every six weeks .
Study DesignAfter determining eligibility ,  informed consent was obtained .
