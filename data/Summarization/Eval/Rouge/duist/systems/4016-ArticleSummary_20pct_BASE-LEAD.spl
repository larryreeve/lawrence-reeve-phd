Introduction .
Colorectal cancer is one of the most common adult  malignant tumours ,  affecting one person in twenty in the  USA and in most developed countries .
Although  40-50% patients may be cured with surgery ,  many will  develop metastatic disease .
For these patients ,  treatment  with fluorouracil ,  usually modulated by folinic acid ,  is  the only option and the median survival is  10-12 months .
When the tumour progresses after first-line treatment with fluorouracil ,  there is no standard  treatment .
Survival is short and associated with weight  loss ,  onset or worsening of tumour-related symptoms ,  and poor quality of life .
Because cytotoxic agents have low response rates and can be associated with severe side-effects ,  many patients receive supportive care .
In first-line chemotherapy ,  fluorouracil with folinic-acid is  better than supportive care (or delayed chemotherapy) for survival and quality of life ,  but the value of second-line chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer has  not yet been proven .
Irinotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor that blocks the DNA replication step of the enzyme , leading to multiple single-strand DNA breaks ,  which eventually blocks cell division .
In phase II studies ,  irinotecan has  objective antitumour activity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer ,  even in those with documented  fluorouracil-resistant tumours ,  with response rates of  11.23% .
An additional 40% of patients experienced tumour stabilisation for a median of 5 months .
Common side-effects included delayed diarrhoea ,  neutropenia , early cholinergic syndrome ,  nausea and  vomiting ,  alopecia , and asthenia .
The dose-limiting toxic  effects were severe diarrhoea and neutropenia .
The trial we report was started in 1995 to compare irinotecan with supportive care alone for survival ,  quality  of life ,  and other clinical variables .
The participants were  patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in whom fluorouracil chemotherapy had failed .
Methods .
Endpoints .
Overall survival was the primary endpoint .
The secondary objectives were the impact of treatment on performance status ,  bodyweight , tumour-related symptoms ,  and quality of life .
Patients' selection .
To be eligible for randomisation ,  patients had to meet the following criteria ,  histologically proven metastatic colorectal cancer ,  progressive metastatic disease documented on the basis of either a 25% increase in the size of target lesions or an increase in carcinoembryonic antigen by 1.25 times an initial reference value and a baseline value of more than 10 ug/L ,   which allowed inclusion of patients with non-measurable  disease (peritoneal carcinomatosis and pelvic recurrences) ,   progression documented by two measurements not separated by  more than 6 months and tumour progression while on  fluorouracil or within 6 months of the last fluorouracil infusion ,  having had one adjuvant and/or no more than two palliative  fluorouracil-based regimens ,  age 18-75 years ,  WHO performance status 0.2 ,  neutrophils 2 10/L or more ,  platelets  100x10/L or more ,  total bilirubin 1.25 the institutional upper normal limit (IUNL) ,  or less ,  liver transaminases 3xIUNL (in  case of liver metastases ,  bilirubin <=1.5 IUNL and  transaminases <=5 IUNL) ,  or more ,  serum creatinine  135 umol/L or less ,  wash-out of 4 weeks for radiotherapy or  chemotherapy ,  and written informed consent .
Patients with the following criteria were not eligible ,  previous treatment with topoisomerase I inhibitors ,  bulky disease (involving more than 50% of the liver volume or 25% of the lung volume ,  or abdominal mass >=10 cm) ,  metastases in the  central nervous system ,  or unresolved bowel obstruction or diarrhoea .
Randomisation and study treatments .
Registration forms were sent to Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Research and Development (Antony ,  France) where eligibility criteria  were electronically checked .
If all criteria were fulfilled ,  the  randomisation was done electronically in the ratio of irinotecan to supportive care 2,1 ,  with stratification by centre .
In the irinotecan group ,  patients were given best supportive care and irinotecan 350 mg/m ,  diluted in 250 mL normal saline or dextrose ,  over a 90 min intravenous infusion every 3 weeks  (or 300 mg/m if aged >=70 years or WHO performance status 2 ,  according to previously recognised risk factors for developing  toxicity) .
Guidelines were provided for the management of side-effects (panel) .
