The treatment of choice will depend on the policy of the institution ,  the gynaecologist or radiation oncologist involved ,  and the age and the general health of the patient .
All patients received standard pretreatment evaluation ,  which included complete blood analysis ,  intravenous pyelogram ,  lymphangiography ,  cystoscopy ,  chest radiography ,  and other tests when indicated .
We used the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) clinical staging system to classify the stage of cancer.7 If there was disagreement about the stage ,  the case was assigned to the earlier stage. 468 patients had FIGO stage Ib or IIa disease. 343 of these patients were enrolled after they had given their informed consent to take part .
Eligibility criteria were ,  age 30–70 years ,  newly diagnosed stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  no concurrent or previous malignant disease ,  WHO performance status of 1 or less ,  and feasibility of both radical surgery and radiotherapy .
Radiotherapy included ,  external pelvic irradiation with 18 MV photon beam by the multiportal technique ,  one dose of 1·8–2·0Gy at the isocentre ,  and two or more portals treated daily .
A complete computerised plane was made ,  according to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements report no 38.8 The total dose at point A (external beam plus brachyradiotherapy) ranged from 70 Gy to 90 Gy (median 76 Gy) .
When lymphangiography showed common iliac or paraortic metastases ,  paraortic lymph nodes were treated with a dose of 45 Gy over 5 weeks and two shaped opposed fields (AP-PA) .
The pathologist provided us with histological subtypes ,  grade ,  depth of invasion ,  tumour size ,  presence of capillary-like-space involvement ,  paracervical-tissue involvement ,  and number ,  site ,  and type of lymph-node metastases .
We classified complications as ,  grade 1 ,  mild symptoms not affecting the patient’s health and easily cured ,  grade 2 ,  symptoms that can be resolved by long-term medical therapies ,  grade 3 ,  major symptoms that require surgery or invasive procedures and affect the performance status of the patient ,  or fatal complications .
We used multivariate Cox regression analysis to assess the effect of cervical size ,  age ,  FIGO state ,  histological type ,  grade of differentiation ,  radiological lymph-node status ,  and treatment group on overall survival .
Of the 468 patients with FIGO stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  125 were excluded because of age (<30 years ,  >70 years ,  n=43) ,  medical illness (n=54) ,  previous or concurrent malignant disease (n=21) ,  or the referring physician’s or patient’s preference for surgery ,  radiotherapy ,  or chemoradiotherapy (n=7) .
After randomisation ,  there were six protocol violations ,  two in the surgery group (one progression before operation and one refusal of any therapy after randomisation) and four in the radiotherapy group (two patients whose cancer was incorrectly staged and two with synchronous neoplasia) .
Ten patients crossed over treatment ,  one refused surgery and was irradiated ,  and nine refused radiotherapy and underwent surgery .
Adjuvant radiotherapy was done in 62 (54%) of the 114 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter of 4 cm or smaller and in 46 (84%) of 55 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm. 19 patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or less and three patients whose cervical diameter was greater than 4 cm had lymph-vascular-space involvement as the only pathological risk factor ,  these patients did not receive postoperative irradiation .
The overall and disease-free actuarial 5-year survival for all patients were 83% and 74% ,  respectively ,  and did not differ significantly between the groups (figure 2). 5-year actuarial survival stratified by cervical diameter was similar in the surgery and radiotherapy groups (diameter < 4 cm ,  87% vs 90% ,  diameter >4 cm ,  70% vs 72% ,  figure 3 ,  table 3). 5-year actuarial disease-free survival for the surgery and radiotherapy groups was 80% and 82% ,  respectively ,  for patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or smaller ,  and 63% and 57% for those with a diameter larger than 4 cm ,  the between group differences were not significant .
For rates of adenocarcinoma there was a significant advantage for patients who had surgery compared with those who had radiotherapy in both overall survival (70% vs 59% ,  p=0·05) and disease-free survival (66% vs 47% ,  p=0·02) .
Patients who had a treatment crossover were excludedfrom the analysis because the same factors that induced the treatment crossover could have affected the subsequent morbidity .
Complications were classified according to the glossary of Chassagne and colleagues.10 In the surgery group ,  48 (28%) patients showed severe (grade 2–3) morbidity that required medical or surgical treatment ,  compared with 19 (12%) patients in the radiotherapy group ,  (p=0·0004 ,  table 3) .
Two deaths were related to the primary treatment ,  both in the surgery group ,  ileal spontaneous perforation (11 months after adjuvant radiotherapy) and pulmonary embolism (17 days after surgery) .
Three (1·7%) surgery-group patients had perioperative complications ,  one vascular lesion during lymphadenectomy ,  one postoperative ureterovaginal fistula ,  and one fatal pulmonary embolism .
Other vesical complications (severe actinic cystitis ,  stress incontinence ,  high-pressure bladder) were recorded in two (3%) patients after surgery ,  11 (10%) after surgery plus radiotherapy ,  and in eight (5%) after radiotherapy alone .
In the radiotherapy group ,  one patient had intestinal perforation ,  one rectovaginal fistula ,  and 12 severe proctites.Severe oedema of the legs occurred in ten (9%) patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy ,  in one (0·6%) patient who had radiotherapy alone ,  and in none of the patients who had surgery alone .
Surgery also offers other advantages ,  pelvic relapses can be successfully cured by radiotherapy ,  whereas salvage surgery after primary irradiation carries a high rate of failures and severe morbidity .
Morbidity is associated with both treatment strategies ,  though the most severe complications ,  such as operative mortality ,  urological complications ,  and tissue damage from irradiation ,  have been reduced during the past 20 years .
In our experience ,  the combination of surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy carries the worst morbidity ,  especially long-term (delayed in onset) complications ,  that are difficult to record during the follow-up .
Hydroureteronephroses ,  oedema of the lower limbs ,  various vesical complications ,  and bowel morbidity are more common and compromising in women who undergo surgery plus radiotherapy .
Our study was not aimed to assess the usefulness of the postoperative treatment ,  though our finding that patients treated with surgery plus radiotherapy were exposed to early and late complicationsof both treatments is important .
This finding should resolve some of the conflicting approaches to this issue.14–16 Our results suggest that the optimum candidates for primary radical surgery are women with normal ovarian function and cervical diameters of 4 cm or smaller ,  whereas radiotherapy is preferable for postmenopausal women .
Women whose cervical diameters are larger than 4 cm should be identified before surgery so that they can benefit from tailored treatment ,  radical radiotherapy ,  with the option of concomitant radiosensitising chemotherapy to improve the local control of the disease ,  or cisplatinbased chemotherapy followed by radical surgery .
