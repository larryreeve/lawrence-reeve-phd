From May ,  1997 ,  to February ,  1998 ,  we enrolled patients who met the following eligibility criteria ,  histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum ,  age 18-75 years ,  WHO performance status of 2 or less and life expectancy of more than 3 months ,  haemoglobin 100 g/L or more ,  absolute neutrophil count 2.0 10/L ,  platelets 150 10/L or more ,  creatinine 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal ,  total bilirubin 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal ,  aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 3.0 or less times the upper limit of normal (if liver metastases present ,  1.5 or less times for bilirubin and 5.0 or less times for aspartate and alanine aminotransferases) ,  and no previous (other than adjuvant) chemotherapy ,  finished more than 6 months before randomisation .
The first group included countries that had recruited more than 30 patients (UK ,  Spain ,  France ,  Czech Republic ,  Germany ,  and Austria) ,  the second countries that had recruited 10.30 patients (Belgium ,  Israel ,  South Africa ,  Switzerland ,  and Italy) ,  and the third countries that had recruited fewer than ten patients (Greece ,  Portugal ,  and the Netherlands) .
We tested the nine following variables ,  sex ,  WHO performance status (<2 and <=2) ,  weight loss (<=5% and >5%) ,  number of organs involved (<3 and <=3) ,  primary tumour site (colon or rectum) ,  organ involvement (liver only or other sites) ,  time from first diagnosis to first metastasis (0.3 ,  >3-12 ,  >12 months) ,  previous surgery ,  and previous adjuvant therapy .
For time to progression ,  Cox's proportional hazards modelling was used ,  with the following variables ,  sex ,  age (<58 and <=58 years) ,  WHO performance status (<2 and >= 2) ,  weight loss (<=5% and >5%) ,  number of organs involved (<3 and >=3) ,  primary tumour site (colon or rectum) ,  liver involvement ,  lymph-node involvement ,  time from first diagnosis to first metastasis (0-3 ,  >3.12 ,  >12 months) ,  previous surgery ,  previous adjuvant therapy ,  time from first diagnosis and first infusion (<9 and <=9 months) .
Tumour characteristics and history in the two groups were comparable ,  except for previous surgery ,  since 89% of patients had had surgery in the irinotecan group and 95% in the no-irinotecan group .
The effect of treatment was significant (p<0.001) ,  the Survival in the irinotecan group was significantly longer hazard ratio for response was 2.6 times higher in the than in the no-irinotecan group (median 17.4 [0.4-28.4+] irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group ,  given the same degree of weight loss at baseline and the same time between first diagnosis and first metastasis .
The survival advantage was reached ,  despite a higher proportion of patients receiving further chemotherapy in the no-irinotecan group (58.3 vs 39.4%) .
This study population was large (385 patients treated) ,  and the patients were representative of candidates for first-line chemotherapy in clinical practice ,  except that an unexpectedly high proportion of them had synchronous metastases at baseline and ,  consequently ,  a relatively low proportion of them had had previous adjuvant chemotherapy .
