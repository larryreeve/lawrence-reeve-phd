The preferred treatment of women with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO IA2–IIA) is radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy .
A retrospective study of patients undergoing radical hysterectomy at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) from 1939 to 1977 identified the following risk factors ,  metastatic tumor to the pelvic lymph nodes ,  large cervical tumor ,  parametrial extension of disease ,  nonsquamous or grade 3 histology ,  and deep (.75%) cervical stromal invasion .
Preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been reported as another approach to management of women with early cervical cancer and high-risk features .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Four centers participated in this clinical trial .
Randomization was performed at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center by the Department of Biostatistics using an envelope system .
RESULTS .
All had 1 risk factor .
Five of 12 chemotherapy alone .
Overall survival and disease-free .
There skin reaction .
DISCUSSION .
Patterns for an early-stage cervical cancer has generally focused on of recurrence did not appear to be significantly different ,  as whether radiation therapy alone is beneficial in reducing presented in Table 2. recurrence rates .
Radiation therapy alone probably reduces .
Toxicity was tolerable in the two treatment arms .
The rate or recurrences among all the patients in the trial  validates the selection of the entry criteria as high-risk factors .
