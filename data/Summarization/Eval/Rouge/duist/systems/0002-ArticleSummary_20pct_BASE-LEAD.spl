CERVICAL cancer is the second most frequent cancer among women worldwide and the most frequent cancer among women in Africa ,  Asia ,  and South America .
In the United States ,  where screening for cervical cancer is readily available ,  most women who are found to have cervical cancer were not screened regularly .
As a result ,  about 25 percent of patients with cervical cancer in the United States present with locally advanced disease (stage IIB through IVA according to the staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) .
The ability of radiotherapy to cure locally advanced cervical cancer is limited by the size of the tumor ,  because the doses required to treat large tumors exceed the limit of toxicity in normal tissue .
Efforts to overcome this problem have included the use of large-particle radiotherapy ,  the use of different radiation-fractionation schedules ,  and the concurrent use of hyperthermia or chemotherapy .
Theoretically ,  chemotherapy and radiotherapy could have a synergistic effect ,  for example ,  the chemotherapy might increase the sensitivity of the tumor to radiation .
Moreover ,  radiotherapy could be used for local disease while chemotherapy is used for systemic disease .
Concurrent chemotherapy inhibits the repair of sublethal damage from radiation ,  synchronizes cells to a particularly radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle ,  and is cytotoxic in vitro .
The concurrent use of single-drug and multiple-drug regimens with radiotherapy has been tested in women with cervical cancer ,  but combination therapy has not gained wide acceptance .
The Gynecologic Oncology Group has performed several prospective ,  randomized studies of the effect of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in women with locally advanced cervical cancer .
Radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea has been compared in separate trials with radiotherapy alone ,  with radiotherapy and concomitant therapy with misonidazole ,  and with radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil (and Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) .
As compared with radiotherapy alone ,  treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy significantly increased the rate of complete response ,  progression-free survival ,  and overall survival .
As compared with treatment with misonidazole and radiotherapy ,  treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy increased progression-free survival and was less toxic .
However ,  treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and radiotherapy resulted in greater improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival than did treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy (Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) .
At the time we were developing the protocol used in the current study ,  radiotherapy plus concomitant chemotherapy with hydroxyurea was the standard combined-therapy regimen for advanced cervical cancer ,  because an early analysis of the combination of radiation ,  cisplatin ,  and fluorouracil failed to show improved progression-free survival .
However ,  myelosuppression is a limiting toxic effect of treatment with hydroxyurea ,  whereas cisplatin is less myelosuppressive and can be given weekly during radiotherapy ,  with acceptable levels of toxicity .
In our study ,  to improve the efficacy of the cisplatin and fluorouracil combination ,  we added hydroxyurea to the regimen ,  because of evidence that this drug inhibits ribonucleotide reductase and depletes tumor cells of deoxyuridine monophosphate .
The depletion of deoxyuridine monophosphate may be important because this compound competes with the active metabolite of fluorouracil ,  fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate ,  for the binding of thymidylate synthase .
In addition ,  the responses in phase 2 trials of this chemotherapy regimen with radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer and in patients with head and neck cancer were favorable .
Therefore ,  we undertook a randomized study in which all women with locally advanced cervical cancer received local radiation as well as weekly concomitant treatment with cisplatin alone ,  the combination of cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  or hydroxyurea alone .
METHODS .
Eligibility .
The institutions that participated in the study are listed in the Appendix .
Women with untreated invasive squamous-cell carcinoma ,  adenosquamous carcinoma ,  or adenocarcinoma of the cervix of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIB (localized disease with parametrial involvement) ,  stage III (extension of the tumor to the pelvic wall) ,  or stage IVB (involvement of the bladder or rectal mucosa) were enrolled in the study from April 1992 to April 1997 .
All cancers were confirmed histologically by the Gynecologic Oncology Group pathology committee .
Patients with disease outside the pelvis and those with metastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes or intraperitoneal disease were not eligible .
Each patient was required to undergo a complete physical examination ,  a pelvic examination under anesthesia ,  chest radiography ,  and intravenous pyelography or abdominal computed tomography to determine the clinical stage of the cancer .
In addition ,  patients were required to have undergone a specific type of extraperitoneal para-aortic lymphadenectomy .
Patients were required to have a Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status of 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  or 3 (equivalent to Karnofsky performance scores of 90 or 100 ,  70 or 80 ,  50 or 60 ,  and 30 or 40 ,  respectively) and to have no history of other cancers .
