Patients were randomized to receive either (a) standard external beam pelvic irradiation (EBRT) in a dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions defined at 100% versus ,  (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional intravenous 5-FU in a dose of 1 g/m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  (c) partially hyperfractionated RT ,  5280 cGy in 33 fractions ,  2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  or (d) arm (c) with the same infusional 5-FU .
In order to detect an improvement of 15% in survival in arms (c) and (d) compared to that seen in arms (a) and (b) ,  assuming a 40% cause-specific survival rate in arm (a) and an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.2 ,  the total number of patients required was 272 .
Of the 23 patients who received no intracavitary radiation or doses less than 500 cGy ,  there was a relatively even distribution across the treatment arms with 5 in arm (a) ,  5 in arm (b) ,  3 in arm (c) ,  and 9 in arm (d) .
