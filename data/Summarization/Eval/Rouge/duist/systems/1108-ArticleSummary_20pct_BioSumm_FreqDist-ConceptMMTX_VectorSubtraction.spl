THE American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics define stage IB cervical cancer as invasive cancer that is confined to the cervix ,  with a depth of more than 5 mm and a width of more than 7 mm. In patients with large stage IB cervical cancers ,  local control and survival are poorer than in patients with smaller stage I cancers ,  whether treated by surgery or irradiation .
Patients .
Patients with histologic evidence of lymph-node involvementwere not eligible ,  nor were those who had previously received radiotherapy or chemotherapy or those with a history of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer .
Fractions of 1.8 to 2.0 Gy were delivered 5 days a week over a period of 4 1/2 to 5 weeks ,  for a total dose of 45 Gy .
Standard Fletcher–Suit or Henschke applicators were used .
A maximum of six doses of cisplatin was given .
Hysterectomy .
Extrafascial hysterectomy was performed three to six weeks after the completion of radiotherapy .
Outcome .
The difference between groups in survival and progression-free survival was evaluated with use of the logrank test according to the intention-to-treat principle .
Differences between groups in the severity of adverse effects and the frequency of hysterectomy specimens that were negative for cancer were evaluated with use of Pearson’s chi-square test .
This interim testing increased the value of the type I error from the conventional 5 percent to 6 percent .
RESULTS .
Characteristics of the Patients .
From February 1992 to April 1997 ,  a total of 374 women were enrolled in the study at 48 Gynecologic Oncology Group institutions .
Thus ,  a total of 369 patients were evaluated ,  186 in the radiotherapy group and 183 in the combined-therapy group .
There were no significant differences in demographic or tumor characteristics between the two groups (Table 1) .
Adverse Effects .
Progression-free Survival .
At the time of this analysis ,  the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher among patients in the combined-therapy group (P<0.001 by the log-rank test) (Fig. 1) .
Prognostic Factors .
Therefore ,  we chose to test the value of concurrent treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy followed by hysterectomy as compared with that of radiotherapy alone followed by hysterectomy .
The promising results of these studies as well as the fact that this combination is well tolerated and easy to administer on an outpatient basis led us to evaluate it in this trial .
In our trial the only difference in the protocols for the two groups was the use of weekly infusions of cisplatin during radiotherapy for bulky stage IB cervical cancers .
This difference appeared to be due to the lower rate of relapses in the pelvic region in the combined-therapy group .
There was no evidence of a difference in the frequencies of late adverse effects between the groups .
We believe that the value of hysterectomy in these patients is doubtful .
The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment ,  but they share a common result ,  all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin .
