DOXORUBICIN (DOX) ,  or Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories ,  Columbus ,  Ohio) ,  is one of the most useful antineoplastic agents available .
One approach to solving this problem is the development of DOX analogues that retain antineoplastic activity but possess reduced potential for cardiac damage .
The antitumor activity of EPI in animal models is similar to that of DOX ,  but EPI is a less toxic compound with regard to both cytotoxicity and cardiac injury .
In the mouse ,  EPI and DOX have similar patterns of distribution to various tissues ,  although drug levels are lower in heart and spleen with EPI .
We used multigated radionuclide cineangiocardiography (RNCA) to assess cardiac toxicity in this prospective ,  randomized study comparing the efficacy ,  acute ,  and chronic toxicities of EPI with DOX in patients with advanced breast cancer .
Patients whose prior treatment included an anthracycline were excluded from this study .
Other criteria for eligibility included a performance status of - 50% (Karnofsky scale) ,  a WBC count - 4,000/14L ,  a platelet count >- 100,000/L ,  normal serum bilirubin levels ( < 1.5 mg/dL) ,  and objectively evaluable or measurable disease .
Pretreatment Evaluation and Follow-up Studies Pretreatment evaluation of patients included complete history and physical examination ,  complete blood cell count (CBC) ,  12-channel biochemical profile ,  serum creatinine ,  chest roentgenogram ,  ECG ,  and bone scan .
Patients were stratified for performance status (Karnofsky scale < 70% v > 80%) and for estrogen receptor status of the primary or a metastatic lesion (positive or unknown v negative) .
All patients were then randomly assigned to receive either EPI or DOX .
Randomization was performed using the method of random permuted blocks ,  which assured an equal number of patients in each arm at specified time points .
Evaluation of ResponseThe criteria for evaluation of therapeutic response were based on the recommendations of the Breast Cancer Task Force of the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda ,  Md).17 These guidelines were modified to include a minor response (MR) category for those patients with unequivocal therapeutic responses ,  but less than that required for a partial response (PR) .
After imageswere obtained at rest for six minutes ,  supine bicycle exercise was started with graded increment in exercise load and monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure .
Exercise was continued until the patient achieved the maximum predicted heart rate or until limited by fatigue ,  severe dyspnea ,  or chest pain .
Cumulative dose to cardiotoxicity and response durations were regarded as right censored variables ,  which were estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier .
Eight patients on the EPI arm and 14 on the DOX arm had received prior radiotherapy to the chest ,  mediastinum ,  or thoracic spine that may have exposed the myocardium to ionizing radiation .
Although the major response rates did not differ between the two arms (chisquare test ,  P = .98) ,  the difference in duration of response is of borderline significance (logrank test ,  P = .11) .
There was no difference (log rank test ,  P = .90) in the median time to progression between the patients on the EPI arm (3.9 months) and those on the DOX arm (5.1 months) .
Nausea or vomiting was documented in 58% of patients who received EPI and 67% of the patients who were treated with DOX .
Because all patients had been treated previously with chemotherapy ,  the degree and incidence of alopecia is difficult to assess ,  however ,  hair loss was noted in 50% of patients treated with EPI and 35% of those treated with DOX .
Of the 15 evaluable patients treated with EPI ,  six had received prior radiotherapy to the chest wall ,  internal mammary lymph nodes ,  sternum ,  or thoracic spine prior to entry on this study ,  and two had a history of well-controlled mild hypertension .
The median dose to development of cardiotoxicity for all evaluable patients was 935 mg/m2 for EPI and 468 mg/m2 for DOX (Fig 2A) .
Nor did all patients experience a steady progressive decline in LVEF ,  most maintained a stable LVEF until there was an acute decrease .
Of the patients who developed symptomatic CHF on the EPI arm ,  one had prior radiotherapy and one had hypertension .
Since only five patients treated with DOX and four treated with EPI actually developed clinical heart failure ,  this result should not be overinterpreted .
Thirteen percent of patients in another recent study developed CHF at a median dose of 405 mg/m 2 when DOX was given on an every three week schedule. 22 With optimal monitoring ,  one might be able to detect subclinical cardiac injury and prevent CHF by stopping the drug ,  this implies ,  however ,  the interruption of effective antineoplastic therapy .
The use of potentially cardioprotective agents such as vitamin E ,  N-acetylcysteine ,  and ICRF-187 has been suggested ,  but the data have not been sufficiently promising to warrant large scale clinical trials .
Two recent studies that used endomyocardial biopsy have demonstrated that a larger total cumulative dose of DOX can be tolerated if the drug is given weekly or by continuous intravenous infusion .
Such scheduling may be more costly than the conventional schedule ,  and may be inconvenient or impractical for both patients and physicians .
Although endomyocardial biopsy is probably the definitive measure of cardiac injury ,  RNCA has the advantage of being noninvasive and ,  therefore ,  acceptable to virtually all patients in a randomized study of antineoplastic agents .
The therapeutic index of an agent is defined by the relationship between the dosage required to produce therapeutic and toxic effects and by the magnitude of the favorable or unfavorable effects observed .
Although these results could have been affected by the greater incidence of cardiac irradiation inpatients treated with DOX ,  only three patients who had received such radiotherapy actually developed CHF ,  one on the EPI arm and two on the DOX arm .
In the murine tumor model systems ,  equal doses of EPI and DOX produce equal therapeutic effects with less host toxicity in the EPI-treated mice ,  but a clinical assessment can only be based on studies in humans .
In the present study ,  each drug was given every three weeks in doses that produced equivalent degrees of myelosuppression ,  a preplanned limitation on the total cumulative dose of EPI was not used .
Brambilla and coworkers in Milan33 studied equal doses (75 mg/m2) of both drugs every three weeks ,  they limited the total cumulative dose of each drug to 600 mg/m2 .
A third study34 compared two multidrug combinations in which 5-fluorouracil (F) 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide (C) 500 mg/m2 were combined with an equal dosage (50 mg/m2) of either EPI (FEC [5-fluorouracil ,  EPI ,  cyclophosphamidel) or DOX (FAC) and administered every three weeks ,  the total dose of EPI was limited to 750 mg/m2 and of DOX to 550 mg/m2 .
Since the present study did not use a fixed limitation for dose of EPI ,  patients who did not have progression of tumor were treated to the point of laboratory cardiotoxicity or clinical CHF ,  therefore ,  this study provides cumulative cardiotoxicity data that are not available in the other two studies .
The other studies ,  which did use dose limits ,  provided data that could confirm the reliability of the survival analysis method we have used to assess the dose effect relationships with regard to RNCA changes .
Our results show that EPI has therapeutic activity that is similar to that of DOX in patients with advanced breast cancer ,  and that EPI is a less cardiotoxic drug than DOX ,  even accounting for the difference in myelosuppressive potency .
In this study ,  worsening cardiac function forced the premature discontinuation of DOX therapy in three patients experiencing partial responses ,  whereas effective treatment with EPI was never discontinued because of cardiac toxicity .
