TRIALS of postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer conducted during the 1960s and 1970s showed significant reductions in rates of locoregional recurrence but no improvement in overall survival .
Nevertheless ,  there are reasons to reconsider radiotherapy ,  including the limited value of adjuvant chemotherapy for bulky disease ,  a synergistic effect of chemotherapy plus radiation on residual locoregional tumor ,  and the possibility that eliminating bulky disease with radiation may improve the effect of chemotherapy ,  because chemotherapy may be more effective when the overall disease burden is low .
METHODS .
The mastectomy was performed according to standard surgical practice between 1979 and 1986 .
Surgery .
Chemotherapy .
Radiation .
Also ,  as part of a second randomization ,  68 patients with estrogen-positive tumors were treated with radiationinduced ovarian ablation that included 20 Gy over a period of five days plus prednisone (7.5 mg per day) for two years ,  as described by Meakin et al. Among these 68 patients ,  33 were assigned to chemotherapy and 35 were assigned to chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
Statistical Analysis .
Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method .
In all the analyses ,  the data were censored as of the date of that follow-up .
RESULTS .
All Patients .
Study Groups .
Subgroups Based on Nodal Involvement .
Side Effects of Radiation .
There were no cases of brachial plexopathy .
DISCUSSION .
There was no excess mortality we could attribute to the long-term side effects of radiotherapy .
