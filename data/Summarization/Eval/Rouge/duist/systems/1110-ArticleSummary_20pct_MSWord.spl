A previous study reported improved survival among women with locally advanced cervical cancer who received prophylactic radiation to the para-aortic nodes .
In 1990 ,  the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) began a randomized clinical trial to compare the effects on survival of treatment with extended-field radiation and treatment with pelvic radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in patients with cervical cancer .
PatientsPara-aortic lymph nodes wereTreatmentThe radioisotopes used for low-dose-rate intracavitary radiotherapy were cesium-137 or radium-226 in 392 of 402 patients (98 percent) .
each intracavitary treatment .
Radiotherapy records ,  including data concerning external-beam fields ,  intracavitary placement ,  doses of radiation to tumor and normal tissues ,  and other treatment variables ,  were reviewed by a radiation oncologist .
On the basis of the results of two earlier RTOG trials ,  we predicted that the five-year survival rate for the control group (radiotherapy alone) would be 65 percent for patients with stage IB or II disease and 40 percent for patients with stage III or IVA disease .
RESULTSCharacteristics of the PatientsThe 388 remaining patients (195 in the combined-therapy group and 193 in the radiotherapy group) form the basis of this analysis .
Treatment and ComplianceRadiotherapy was delivered according to the protocol or with minor deviations in 83 percent of the patients in the combined-therapy group and 84 percent of those in the radiotherapy group .
Major but acceptable treatment deviations occurred in another 1 percent and 9 percent of these groups ,  respectively .
Eleven patients (3 percent) did not undergo brachytherapy: three patients refused ,  and eight patients did not undergo it for other reasons .
In all ,  26 patients did not complete treatment .
Of the 195 patients in the combination-therapy group ,  159 (81 percent) completed at least two cycles of chemotherapy ,  and 133 (68 percent) completed three cycles .
Chemotherapy was discontinued because of toxic effects in 9 patients ,  refusal to continue in the case of 17 patients ,  diminished performance status in 4 patients ,  and other reasons in 4 patients .
Side EffectsThere were no significant differences in the seriousness of late effects between the treatment groups .
Follow-up data were available for 193 of the 195 patients in the combined-therapy group and for all 193 patients in the radiotherapy group .
Of these ,  147 patients in the combined-therapy group (76 percent) and 122 patients in the radiotherapy group (63 percent) were alive at the time of the last analysis .
In addition ,  13 patients in the combined-therapy group and 32 patients in the radiotherapy group were alive  but had recurrent cervical cancer .
Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that overall survival rates were significantly better among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy than among those treated with radiotherapy alone (73 percent vs. 58 percent ,  P=0.004) (Table 5 and Fig. 1) .
Disease-free survivalat five years was 67 percent in the combined-therapy group and 40 percent in the radiotherapy group ,  according to Kaplan–Meier analysis (P<0.001) (Fig .
2) .
The relative likelihood of disease-free survival in the combined-therapy group ,  as compared with the radiotherapy group ,  was 0.48 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.35 to 0.66) .
The rates of distant relapse were 14 percent in the combined-therapy group and 33 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) ,  with a relative risk of relapse of 0.39 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.24 to 0.63) in the combined-therapy group .
Approximately 70 percent of the patients assigned to each group had stage IB ,  IIA ,  or IIB disease .
For these patients ,  overall survival was significantly better if they were treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
For patients with stage III or IVA disease ,  the five-year disease-free survival rates were 58 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 38 percent in the radiotherapy group (P=0.13) .
We found that the combination of pelvic radiation and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil was more effective for locally advanced cervical cancer than pelvic and para-aortic radiation alone .
The inclusion of chemotherapy substantially reduced both local and distant recurrences of cervical cancer ,  leading to higher overall and disease-free survival rates .
For patients with known metastases to the para-aortic lymph nodes ,  para-aortic radiation is probably necessary .
The role of extended-field radiation with chemotherapy must also be defined .
