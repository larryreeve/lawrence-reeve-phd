ALTHOUGH MANY PATIENTS with carcinoma of the uterine cervix are cured with local measures ,  a substantial minority recur or present with metastases and are potential candidates for systemic therapy .
Since there were only 18 assessable patients , the study was too small for definitive conclusions .
Lesions measurable by physical examination or chest x-ray were required .
Patients were to have recovered from effects of recent surgery or radiotherapy and be free of clinically significant infection .
Originally ,  the protocol was less stringent about renal function and had no specification about serum albumin level .
This change was prompted by reports of encephalopathy on the ifosfamide arm (described in Results) .
Statistical Considerations .
They are also included in the analysis of overall survival and PFS ,  but are not included in the summary of toxicity .
Patient pretreatment characteristics were well balanced among the three arms (Table 1) .
As a result ,  the eligibility criteria for the trial were revised .
There were 34 stage IVB patients ,  of whom 31 had no prior radiotherapy ,  seven of 31 (23%) had a response to protocol chemotherapy .
Response by site of measurable disease is listed in Table 5 .
Age was associated with survival (P =.025) ,  with younger age being unfavorable (Fig 3) ,  this ,  in turn ,  was correlated with a shorter time from diagnosis to study entry .
Histologic grade and prior radiotherapy were not significantly associated with survival .
DISCUSSION .
It remains to be seen whether the addition of bleomycin will be helpful ,  that is the subject of a current randomized trial .
There is a paucity of phase III chemotherapy trials in advanced cervix cancer .
Such a study would be of great interest .
Perhaps this is a step in the right direction ,  albeit with more toxicity .
In fact ,  this appears to be the first evidence of an impact of a chemotherapy regimen on PFS in advanced cervix cancer .
Whether this can be translated into a survival benefit by the addition of bleomycin remains to be determined .
Fortunately ,  curative local therapy is available when this disease is diagnosed at a much earlier stage .
