Survival time in these patients is typically short .
Methods .
Our primary endpoint was response rate .
Time to progression was the time from randomisation to progression .
The duration of response was the time from first infusion to progression in responding patients .
For the weekly regimen ,  each treatment cycle was 7 weeks and for the 2-weekly regimen ,  6 weeks .
We used the validated QLQC30 questionnaire of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer .
For continuous variables ,  we used Student's t tests .
We did log-rank tests stratified by this variable .
The time to definitive deterioration from baseline by 5% ,  10% ,  20% ,  and 30% was analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method .
The median duration of treatment was longer in the irinotecan than in the no-irinotecan group ,  irrespective of regimen (24.0 vs 21.0 weeks for the weekly regimen ,  24.6 vs 18.0 for the 2-weekly regimen) .
In the evaluable population ,  the response rate was 49% in the irinotecan group ,  compared with 31% in the noirinotecan group (p<0.001) .
In the intention-to-treat analysis of the 2weekly regimen ,  the response rate was ,  for the irinotecan and 11.4 (5.3-29.6) weeks in the no-irinotecan group .
The median duration of response was 9.3 (2.8-13.1) months in the irinotecan group and 8.8 (3.7-11.8) months in the no-irinotecan group (p=0.08) .
Duration of response and stabilisation was longer in the irinotecan group (8.6 [1.6-13.6] vs 6.2 [1.1-11.8] months ,  p<0.001) .
The log-rank test was significant (p=0.0098) .
The log-rank test stratified by regimen and that stratified by country were significant (each p<0.001) .
Median followirinotecan group was 69.8% and 54.8% ,  respectively .
In Cox’s multivariate analysis of time to progression (table 4) ,  age and number of organs involved were significantly predictive .
The vs 14.1 [0.5-27.6+] months ,  p=0.031 ,  figure 3) .
The median time to treatment failure was 5.3 (0.4-15.7+) months in the irinotecan group and 3.8 (0.4-11.5+) months in the no-irinotecan group (p=0.0014) .
Doses were reduced because of toxic effects more frequently for the weekly regimen than for the 2-weekly regimen ,  and more in the irinotecan than in the noirinotecan group .
Doses were reduced in 29.6% of patients on the weekly regimen and 18.6% on the 2 weekly regimen in the irinotecan and no-irinotecan groups ,  respectively ,  and in 20.9% and 4.9% on the 2 weekly regimen .
1161 questionnaires were obtained from the 385 patients in the intention-to-treat population .
The two groups did not differ significantly at baseline ,  except for cognitive function (mean 89.9 [SE 1.1] vs 86.1 [1.5] ,  p=0.05) .
The same trend was seen with the second imputation method .
Definitive deterioration in quality of life occurred consistently later in the irinotecan group ,  for a deterioration from baseline by 5% (p=0.03) ,  10% (p=0.06) ,  20% (p=0.04) ,  and 30% (p=0.06) .
The higher frequency of adverse events in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan did not affect the median duration of treatment .
In two phase-III studies ,  for oxaliplatin in combination with infusional fluorouracil and calcium folinate ,  the response rate and progression-free survival were better than with fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone .
Moreover ,  there was a trend towards shorter survival in the oxaliplatin group in one study .
Another phase III study that compared irinotecan combined with bolus fluorouracil and fluorouracil alone consistently provided significantly higher response rates (33 vs 18% ,  p<0.001) and median time to treatment failure (5.0 vs 3.8 months ,  p<0.05) in the irinotecan group .
