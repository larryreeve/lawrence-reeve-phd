Introduction .
The aim was to increase the number of patients in whom curative resection could be done ,  and so improve survival rates .
Patients and methods .
Two parallel opposed fields 18 cm by 15 cm were positioned to cover the tumour with an adequate proximal margin (normally 5 cm). 20 daily fractions of 2 Gy at the mid-plane central axis of the volume of the tumour were given over 4 weeks .
Event-free times were recorded from the date of randomisation .
The date of first confirmed distant recurrence was also recorded .
Statistical analysis .
All analyses were carried out by intention to treat .
Results .
Of the 279 patients ,  217 died .
Surgeons were also asked to report any other complications .
There was no evidence of an excess of complications in the radiotherapy group .
However ,  the number of lymph nodes examined was lower in the radiotherapy group .
However ,  the data are compatible with a reduction in the risk of as much as a half or as little as 2% .
Necropsy was done rarely and so causes of death should be interpreted with caution .
However ,  cause-specific survival analysis suggests a larger benefit for radiotherapy .
This estimate indicates a substantial decrease in the risk of death from colorectal cancer in patients allocated radiotherapy ,  although the data are compatible with a halving of the risk of death from colorectal cancer at one extreme or as little as 3% reduction in risk at the other .
Discussion .
There was evidence of benefit from preoperative radiotherapy before the trial .
There was a suggestion that the risk of death from colorectal cancer was reduced ,  and a trend towards an improvement in overall survival .
However ,  the trial was of sufficient size to detect only substantial improvement in overall survival .
This reluctance may have hindered recruitment to the trial .
Also there was a general misinterpretation of the outcome of the initial trial of low-dose radiotherapy .
In addition ,  the patients selected for this study represent only a small proportion of total operable cases .
