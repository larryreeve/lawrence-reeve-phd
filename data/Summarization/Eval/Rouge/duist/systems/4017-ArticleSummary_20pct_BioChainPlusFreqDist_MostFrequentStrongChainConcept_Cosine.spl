Phase III studies of patients whose disease had not responded to first-line fluorouracil ,  or patients whose disease had progressed after first-line fluorouracil treatment ,  showed increased survival times in patients given irinotecan compared with those receiving best supportive care or high-dose fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone by continuous infusion .
From May ,  1997 ,  to February ,  1998 ,  we enrolled patients who met the following eligibility criteria ,  histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum ,  age 18-75 years ,  WHO performance status of 2 or less and life expectancy of more than 3 months ,  haemoglobin 100 g/L or more ,  absolute neutrophil count 2.0 10/L ,  platelets 150 10/L or more ,  creatinine 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal ,  total bilirubin 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal ,  aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 3.0 or less times the upper limit of normal (if liver metastases present ,  1.5 or less times for bilirubin and 5.0 or less times for aspartate and alanine aminotransferases) ,  and no previous (other than adjuvant) chemotherapy ,  finished more than 6 months before randomisation .
We randomly assigned patients irinotecan combined with fluorouracil and calcium folinate (irinotecan group) or fluorouracil and calcium folinate only (no-irinotecan group ,  figure 1) .
We needed to include 338 evaluable patients to show a significant difference in response rate between treatment groups ,  assuming response rates of 35% in the no-irinotecan group and 50% in the irinotecan group ,  by use of two-tailed X tests (a=0.05 ,  power 0.80) .
Based on the assumption that time to progression would be 6 months in the no-irinotecan group and 9 months in the irinotecan group ,  we calculated that 286 patients were needed to show a significant difference for this variable .
The first group included countries that had recruited more than 30 patients (UK ,  Spain ,  France ,  Czech Republic ,  Germany ,  and Austria) ,  the second countries that had recruited 10.30 patients (Belgium ,  Israel ,  South Africa ,  Switzerland ,  and Italy) ,  and the third countries that had recruited fewer than ten patients (Greece ,  Portugal ,  and the Netherlands) .
Of the 385 patients treated in the study ,  only 97 (25%) received treatment by the weekly regimen (54 in the irinotecan group and 43 in the no-irinotecan group) .
The other 288 patients received treatment every 2 weeks (145 in the irinotecan group and 143 in the no-irinotecan group) .
A higher proportion of women were assigned fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone than the irinotecan regimen ,  and the rectum was the primary tumour site in a higher proportion of patients in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group .
Tumour characteristics and history in the two groups were comparable ,  except for previous surgery ,  since 89% of patients had had surgery in the irinotecan group and 95% in the no-irinotecan group .
The median duration of treatment was longer in the irinotecan than in the no-irinotecan group ,  irrespective of regimen (24.0 vs 21.0 weeks for the weekly regimen ,  24.6 vs 18.0 for the 2-weekly regimen) .
In the no-irinotecan group ,  the relative dose intensity was 0.90 in the weekly regimen and 0.96 in the 2-weekly regimen .
39.4% of patients in the irinotecan group and 58.3% in the no-irinotecan group received further chemotherapy ,  31.0% of the no-irinotecan group subseqently received irinotecan .
In the did not enable provision of an accurate estimation of the intention-to-treat population ,  response rate was also significantly higher in the irinotecan group than in the noirinotecan group (34.8 [28.2-41.9] vs 21.9% [16.2-28.5] ,  p=0.005 ,  table 2) .
The median time to onset of response was 8.9 (range 4.7-25.4) weeks in the irinotecan group medians.21 The probability of survival in the irinotecan group was 84.9% at 9 months and 75.5% at 12 months ,  and in the no-irinotecan group was 77.3% and 62.7% ,  respectively .
In the intention-to-treat analysis of the 2weekly regimen ,  the response rate was ,  for the irinotecan and 11.4 (5.3-29.6) weeks in the no-irinotecan group .
The effect of treatment was significant (p<0.001) ,  the Survival in the irinotecan group was significantly longer hazard ratio for response was 2.6 times higher in the than in the no-irinotecan group (median 17.4 [0.4-28.4+] irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group ,  given the same degree of weight loss at baseline and the same time between first diagnosis and first metastasis .
There was insufficient power to compare the efficacy risk of progression for a patient in the no-irinotecan group was increased by about 69% compared with that for a patient in the irinotecan group when all other variables were equal .
The time to definitive deterioration in performance status was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group (median 11.2 [0.1+.15.7+]) vs 9.9 [0+.13¡¤6+] months ,  p=0.046 ,  figure 4 ) .
In the irinotecan group ,  diarrhoea and neutropenia were the most common toxic effects in each regimen ,  and were significantly more frequent and severe than in the noirinotecan group .
Among patients receiving the weekly regimen ,  diarrhoea led to hospital admission for 17 (31.5%) in the irinotecan group and five (11.6%) in the no-irinotecan group .
For the 2-weekly regimen ,  16 (11.0%) patients in the irinotecan group and two (1.4%) in the no-irinotecan group were admitted for diarrhoea .
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and leukopenia were significantly more frequent in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group ,  irrespective of regimen .
In the irinotecan group ,  admission was required for fever in the absence of infection with concomitant grade 3 or 4 neutropenia for five (9.3%) patients on the weekly regimen and one (0.7%) on the 2-weekly regimen ,  for the no-irinotecan group ,  admission was required for one (2.3%) patient on the weekly regimen and none on the 2 weekly regimen .
Asthenia was the second most frequent nonhaematological toxic effect in the irinotecan group ,  and grade 3 or 4 asthenia was significantly more frequent in this group than in the no-irinotecan group for the 2-weekly regimen .
Grade 3 or 4 infection without grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was significantly more frequent in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group .
Despite the high frequency of side-effects ,  in the irinotecan group ,  the relative dose intensity was preserved compared with the no-irinotecan group .
The rate of return was similar in the two treatment groups.62% in the irinotecan group and 59% in the no-irinotecan group .
When missing data for death ,  progressive disease ,  or grade 3.4 adverse events were taken into account with the two imputation methods ,  results were biased in favour of the no-irinotecan group .
Combination of irinotecan with fluorouracil and calcium folinate significantly increased response rates ,  time to progression ,  and survival .
The survival advantage was reached ,  despite a higher proportion of patients receiving further chemotherapy in the no-irinotecan group (58.3 vs 39.4%) .
