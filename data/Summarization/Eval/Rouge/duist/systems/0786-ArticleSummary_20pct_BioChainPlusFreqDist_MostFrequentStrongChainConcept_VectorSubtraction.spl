Preoperative and postoperative radiation therapy alone ,  while reducing the local recurrence rate ,  has not been shown to improve survival .
Treatment was limited to patients with tumors penetrating the full thickness of the rectal wall or with metastasis to regional lymph nodes .
The leukemogenic effect of MeCCNU was established subsequent to the initiation of GI 7175 ,  indeed ,  one patient who participated in GI 7175 developed acute myeloid leukemia after MeCCNU therapy .
Patients must have recovered from the acute effects of surgery ,  been capable of starting treatment within 60 days after resection ,  had no evidence of active infection ,  had adequate performance and nutritional status to tolerate protocol treatment ,  and had no preexisting or concurrent malignant tumors except basal cell or superficial squamous cell carcinomas of the skin .
The treatment volume as defined must have received 4,140 cGy at a rate of 180 cGy/d ,  five treatments per week .
After this 5-week period ,  patients received one of the two chemotherapy schedules .
One dose of MeCCNU 100 mg/m was to be given orally on day 1 .
One year after study activation ,  treatment duration was decreased to a total of 12 months of treatment due to concerns about the leukemic potential of MeCCNU .
Dose reductions of 5-FU by 25% were required for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU treatment arm who experienced a leukocyte count nadir of below 2,000/UL during the first 3 weeks .
Treatment with 5-FU was to be continued at 5-week intervals .
The original design called for the enrollment of 134 patients per arm ,  and the primary end point was to detect a difference in the 30-month disease-free survival rate from .65 for the MeCCNU-containing arm to .80 for the escalating 5-FU arm .
Given the leukemic potential of MeCCNU ,  it is important to find a treatment that is at least as effective as a treatment containing MeCCNU .
Using the techniques of Makuch and Simon ,  it can be shown that a sample size of 100 patients per arm has an 80% power to exclude differences in treatments as great as .19 assuming a = .05 and a 30-month rate of .65 .
The contribution of variables and treatment effect was tested using the proportional hazards procedures of Cox and the log-rank test .
The remaining 199 patients (95% of the registered population) are included for survival analysis in the study group to which they were randomized regardless of whether or not protocol treatment was administered .
Four patients received no protocol treatment and are excluded from the toxicity analyses but are included in the survival and disease-free survival analyses .
Although the protocol required treatment to begin within 60 days of surgery ,  20 patients evenly distributed between the two treatment arms began treatment more than 60 days postsurgery ,  16 of the 20 individuals received their initial therapy within 64 days .
Treatment Administration .
Two treatment-related deaths were reported ,  one on each treatment arm .
One event occurred in a 50-year old man assigned to receive escalating 5-FU .
Six patients are reported to have experienced severe (three) or life-threatening (three) treatment-related intestinal obstructions ,  two receiving the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen and four on escalating 5-FU (Table 2) .
One patient developed intestinal obstruction during the radiation therapy .
The difference in disease-free survival favors the escalating 5-FU arm ,  but this difference is not statistically significant (P = .20 ,  two-tailed) .
Similarly ,  when only eligible patients who received post-radiation therapy drug treatment were considered (84 escalating 5-FU and 72 5-FU and MeCCNU patients) ,  no difference in direction or magnitude of the RR estimate was observed (RR = 1.17 ,  95% CI ,  .74 to 1.85) .
Eighty-one of the deaths were attributed to progressive disease ,  and one death was reported without documented cause ,  the causes of death for the remaining nine patients were attributed to treatment (two patients ,  discussed above) ,  myocardial infarctions (five , three of whom had a suspected recurrence) ,  stroke (one) ,  and metastatic disease resulting from a new primary tumor arising in the bile duct (one) .
The one death with no cause reported was on the escalating 5-FU arm .
There is no difference between the two arms with respect to the survival distributions (P = .58 ,  two-tailed) .
Median survival has not been reached in either treatment arm .
As in the disease-free analysis ,  secondary analyses of survival considering either all patients randomized or only patients who received treatment after the completion of radiation therapy ,  resulted in no meaningful change in direction or magnitude of the RR attributed to treatment with the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen (RR = 1.10 ,  95% CI ,  .72 to 1.67 ,  and RR = 1.04 ,  95% CI ,  .65 to 1.67 ,  respectively) .
There were no differences between the radiation and escalating 5-FU arm of GI7180 and the radiation and 5-FU and MeCCNU arm of GI 7175 with respect to survival within any stage (Fig 4) .
The results of this study indicate that treatment after surgical resection of Dukes B2 and C rectal cancer with escalating 5-FU postradiation therapy provides similar survival and recurrence outcomes as a postradiation chemotherapeutic regimen including the leukemogen MeCCNU .
Because of toxicity ,  patients often received no therapy beyond the initial radiation treatment .
Results from the previous GITSG study (GI 7175) of adjuvant therapy after surgical resection of Dukes B2 or C rectal cancer demonstrated improved survival and disease-free survival in patients treated with combination radiation therapy and post radiation therapy using 5-FU and MeCCNU when compared with surgery alone ,  and improved disease-free survival for patients treated with this combined modality therapy compared with radiation therapy alone .
Although data from the initial rectal cancer adjuvant trial conducted by the National Surgical Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP RO1) suggested improved survival and disease-free survival in patients treated with chemotherapy alone compared with surgery alone ,  that study did not include a combined modality treatment arm .
GI 7180 ,  a protocol designed more than a decade ago ,  used a treatment plan that most likely is now outdated .
Different methods of 5-FU administration (eg ,  rapid infusion ,  prolonged continuous infusion) have been compared in an attempt to maximize radiation sensitization and further reduce the rate of locoregional recurrence .
It appears highly unlikely that further follow-up in GI 7180 will result in 5-FU and MeCCNU treatment being superior to escalating 5-FU .
