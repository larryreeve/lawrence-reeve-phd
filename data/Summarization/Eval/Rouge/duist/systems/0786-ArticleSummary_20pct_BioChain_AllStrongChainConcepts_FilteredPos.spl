In 1985 ,  the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG ,  study GI 7175) reported that postoperative radiation and chemotherapy reduced the tumor recurrence rate for patients who had undergone a curative resection for rectal adenocarcinoma .
Treatment was limited to patients with tumors penetrating the full thickness of the rectal wall or with metastasis to regional lymph nodes .
Although the superiority of combination radiotherapy and chemotherapy with fluorouracil(5-FU) and semustine (MeCCNU) was clearly shown in terms of both disease-free survival and ,  subsequently , overall survival ,  the clinical impact of such treatment was tempered by the inclusion of MeCCNU in an adjuvant setting .
A two-arm study was designed using the initial radiation/chemotherapy program of the previous study (GI 7175) for both arms of the new study (GI 7180) but to offering MeCCNU to only half the patients during the postradiation period .
An escalating single-agent 5-FU regimen incorporating a theoretical maximum-tolerated dose was chosen as the alternative treatment option based on clinical evidence suggesting a dose response curve for 5-FU and pilot data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggesting added efficacy of 5-FU when given at higher dose levels .
Presence of ascites ,  peritoneal seeding ,  residual pelvic tumor ,  positive paraaortic lymph node biopsy ,  or distant metastases excluded patients from study ,  as did previous chemotherapy or pelvic irradiation or any active and significant coexistent disease that ,  in the judgment of the investigator ,  would make the risks of chemotherapy or radiation therapy prohibitive .
Normal hepatic ,  renal ,  and bone marrow function (ie ,  bilirubin level < 2.5 mg/dL ,  BUN level< 25 mg/dL ,  or creatinine level < 1.5 mg/dL ,  leukocyte and platelet counts > 4,500/uL and 125,000/uL ,  respectively) must have been documented before study entry .
The inferior margin included the perineumin all patients who underwent an abdominal-perineal resection and whose tumor was <= 5 cm from the dentate line .
The treatment volume as defined must have received 4,140 cGy at a rate of 180 cGy/d ,  five treatments per week .
Chemotherapy .
During postradiotherapy chemotherapy ,  moderate or severe nausea or vomiting required a 50% dose reduction of all chemotherapy for one course ,  mild stomatitis or diarrhea ,  continued but not escalated therapy ,  and moderate or worse stomatitis ,  reduction of the next course of chemotherapy by 25% .
Dose reductions of 5-FU by 25% were required for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU treatment arm who experienced a leukocyte count nadir of below 2,000/UL during the first 3 weeks .
Repetition of severe marrow depression (leukocyte count < 1,500/UL) or thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 25,000/UL) after dose reduction or persistent leukopenia (leukocyte count < 4,000/UL) or thrombocytopenia (< 100,000/UL) at 10 weeks after the last dose of MeCCNU disqualified a patient from any further treatment with MeCCNU .
Dose reduction criteria for the 5-FU escalating arm included no escalation if leukocyte count nadir was below 2,000/UL but at least 1,000/UL and platelet count nadir between 75,000/UL and 99,999/UL and a 25% reduction in the next course for leukocyte nadir below 1,000/UL and platelet count nadir below 75,000/UL .
Central review of radiotherapy treatment records including contour and isodose curves ,  dosimetry calculations ,  simulation films ,  verification films for each port displaying treatment fields ,  and dose prescription was conducted by Dr P.R.M .
Reasons for ineligibility were as follows ,  colon cancer rather than rectal cancer (five patients) ,  prior history of cancer (two) ,  and incomplete resection (four) .
Four patients received no protocol treatment and are excluded from the toxicity analyses but are included in the survival and disease-free survival analyses .
Although the protocol required treatment to begin within 60 days of surgery ,  20 patients evenly distributed between the two treatment arms began treatment more than 60 days postsurgery ,  16 of the 20 individuals received their initial therapy within 64 days .
The median follow-up time for the 108 surviving patients is 5.8 years with 3 years of follow-up available for all but five surviving patients .
Treatment Administration .
Two patients on each treatment arm received no adjuvant therapy ,  and 16 patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and 18 patients assigned to the escalating 5-FU regimen received no postradiation chemotherapy .
As planned in the protocol design ,  patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm were treated for a longer duration than patients who received escalating 5-FU (median ,  11.3 months v 7.5 months ,  respectively) .
Also as planned ,  among patients who received chemotherapy ,  dose intensity of 5-FU was greater on the escalating 5-FU arm versus the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm .
Two treatment-related deaths were reported ,  one on each treatment arm .
Six patients are reported to have experienced severe (three) or life-threatening (three) treatment-related intestinal obstructions ,  two receiving the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen and four on escalating 5-FU (Table 2) .
The prognostic importance of Dukes stage ,  resection type ,  distance to the nearest margin ,  age ,  sex ,  and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score on disease-free survival was examined in the cohort of eligible patients .
When included in the Cox model ,  Dukes stage ,  resection type ,  distance to the nearest margin (<= 3 cm v other) ,  and the interaction between resection type and distance to the nearest margin were found to be significant without adjustment for multiple comparisons in predicting disease-free survival(P < .05) .
Eighty-one of the deaths were attributed to progressive disease ,  and one death was reported without documented cause ,  the causes of death for the remaining nine patients were attributed to treatment (two patients ,  discussed above) ,  myocardial infarctions (five , three of whom had a suspected recurrence) ,  stroke (one) ,  and metastatic disease resulting from a new primary tumor arising in the bile duct (one) .
The RR for death associated with 5-FU and MeCCNU adjusted for stage ,  resection type ,  and distance to the nearest margin is 1.10 (95% CI , .68 to 1.52 ,  P = .67) .
Median survival has not been reached in either treatment arm .
Figure 3 compares the survival prognosis of patients undergoing abdominal-perineal resections and patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to margin of resection (as determined by the pathologist on fresh specimen) of <= 3 cm and greater than 3 cm. Patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to the margin greater than 3 cm experienced improved survival compared with patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to the nearest margin <= 3 cm ,  suggesting that abdominal-perineal resection should be considered when the distal margin for resection with the low anterior route would be <= 3 cm .
As in the disease-free analysis ,  secondary analyses of survival considering either all patients randomized or only patients who received treatment after the completion of radiation therapy ,  resulted in no meaningful change in direction or magnitude of the RR attributed to treatment with the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen (RR = 1.10 ,  95% CI ,  .72 to 1.67 ,  and RR = 1.04 ,  95% CI ,  .65 to 1.67 ,  respectively) .
The results of this study indicate that treatment after surgical resection of Dukes B2 and C rectal cancer with escalating 5-FU postradiation therapy provides similar survival and recurrence outcomes as a postradiation chemotherapeutic regimen including the leukemogen MeCCNU .
Both survival and disease-free survival results favor the escalating 5-FU arm ,  although these differences did not reach statistical significance .
Results from the previous GITSG study (GI 7175) of adjuvant therapy after surgical resection of Dukes B2 or C rectal cancer demonstrated improved survival and disease-free survival in patients treated with combination radiation therapy and post radiation therapy using 5-FU and MeCCNU when compared with surgery alone ,  and improved disease-free survival for patients treated with this combined modality therapy compared with radiation therapy alone .
The results of the present study confirm the expected survival and disease-free survival probabilities observed in the combination therapy arm of the previous GITSG study ,  while the recent report by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) further demonstrates the advantage of combination radiation therapy and chemotherapy compared with radiation therapy alone in reducing recurrence rates and improving survival .
A recent National Institutes of Health consensus conference on adjuvant therapy for patients with colon and rectal cancer concluded that combined postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy improved local control and survival in stage B2 and C patients with rectal cancer and that treatment with combined modality therapy in these patients is recommended .
