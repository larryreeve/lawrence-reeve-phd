Introduction .
Adjuvant chemotherapy of colorectal cancer has been tested in several randomised trials .
Liver metastases are observed at diagnosis of primary colorectal cancer in 25-30% of patients .
Intraportal injection of cytotoxic agents at the time of surgery for colorectal cancer was advocated in 1957 to prevent liver metastases .
The initial response rate was 83% .
We report long-term results here .
Patients and methods .
To be eligible ,  patients had to have no evidence of metastatic disease in preoperative investigations. 29 patients had liver metastases diagnosed at resection and 8 had incomplete resection .
All probability values were two-sided .
All analyses were done according to the principle of intention to treat .
Results .
Later the curves come closer together .
Treatment outcome was similar in all subgroups ,  and was best in that with positive nodes .
These abnormalities had resolved at the first follow-up examination .
Discussion .
This trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase survival in patients with colorectal cancer .
We know of at least twelve prospective controlled studies with a similar design .
Most were multicentre trials and some excluded patients with rectal cancer .
We have investigated this hypothesis in a second clinical trial .
