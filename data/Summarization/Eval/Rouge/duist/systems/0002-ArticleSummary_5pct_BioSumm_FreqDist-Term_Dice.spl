Women with untreated invasive squamous-cell carcinoma ,  adenosquamous carcinoma ,  or adenocarcinoma of the cervix of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIB (localized disease with parametrial involvement) ,  stage III (extension of the tumor to the pelvic wall) ,  or stage IVB (involvement of the bladder or rectal mucosa) were enrolled in the study from April 1992 to April 1997 .
Other eligibility criteria were as follows ,  a leukocyte count of at least 3000 per cubic millimeter ,  a platelet count of at least 100,000 per cubic millimeter ,  a serum creatinine level of no more than 2.0 mg per deciliter (177 umol per liter) ,  a serum bilirubin level that was no more than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal at the institution where it was measured ,  and a serum aspartate aminotransferase level that was no more than 3 times the upper limit of normal at the institution where it was measured .
The total dose delivered to point A (a reference location 2 cm lateral and 2 cm superior to the cervical os) was 80.8 Gy in patients with stage IIB and 81.0 Gy in patients with stage III or IVA disease ,  the total dose delivered to point B (the pelvic wall) was 55.0 Gy in patients with stage IIB disease and 60.0 Gy in patients with stage III or IVA disease .
The relative risk of progression of disease or death was 0.57 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.42 to 0.78) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0.55 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.40 to 0.75) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy ,  after adjustment for the clinical stage of disease .
After adjustment for the clinical stage of disease ,  the relative risk of death was 0.61 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.44 to 0.85) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0.58 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.41 to 0.81) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
The number of patients who received within 15 percent of the prescribed total dose to both point A (69 to 93 Gy) and point B (stage IIB ,  47 to 63 Gy ,  stage III or IVA ,  51 to 59 Gy) was 159 (90 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  147 (85 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 149 (84 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
The median delay was 8 days (the 10th percentile was a time 2 days ahead of schedule ,  and the 90th percentile was a delay of 22 days) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  10 days (10th and 90th percentiles ,  1 and 26) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 8 days (10th and 90th percentiles ,  1 day ahead of schedule and a delay of 23 days) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
In a phase 3 trial conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group ,  388 patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy either with cisplatin and fluorouracil or with hydroxyurea (Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) ,  the two-drug regimen improved survival (relative risk of death ,  0.74 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.58 to 0.95) .
