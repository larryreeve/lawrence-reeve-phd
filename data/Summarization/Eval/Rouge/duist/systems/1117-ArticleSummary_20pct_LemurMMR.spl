we used the international federation of gynaecology and obstetrics figo clinical staging system to classify the stage of cancer 7 if there was disagreement about the stage the case was assigned to the earlier stage 468 patients had figo stage ib or iia disease 343 of these patients were enrolled after they had given their informed consent to take part 
the overall and disease free actuarial 5 year survival for all patients were 83 and 74 respectively and did not differ significantly between the groups figure 2 5 year actuarial survival stratified by cervical diameter was similar in the surgery and radiotherapy groups diameter 4 cm 87 vs 90 diameter 4 cm 70 vs 72 figure 3 table 3 5 year actuarial disease free survival for the surgery and radiotherapy groups was 80 and 82 respectively for patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or smaller and 63 and 57 for those with a diameter larger than 4 cm the between group differences were not significant 
the treatment of choice will depend on the policy of the institution the gynaecologist or radiation oncologist involved and the age and the general health of the patient 
stage ib and iia carcinoma of the cervix can be cured by radical surgery or radiotherapy with similar effectiveness but the rate and types of complications differ 
morley and seski s study of 446 patients with stage ib disease recruited between 1945 and 1975 and treated with radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy or external irradiation and brachyradiotherapy reported crude 5 year survival of 87 and 83 respectively 
the latter approach offers the advantages of surgery and the neoadjuvant chemotherapy will keep to a minimum the risk of extracervical spread of the tumour withoutcombining surgery and radiotherapy 
dissection of the pelvic lymph node consisted of removal of all fatty lymph node bearing tissue anterior lateral and posterior to the common external and internal iliac vessels and anterior to the obturator nerve 
the median time to recurrence did not differ significantly between the surgery and radiotherapy groups 20 vs 18 months p 0 24 82 of pelvic recurrences and 61 of the distant ones became evident within 2 years of the primary treatment 
the sum of the short term and long term complications exceeds the total number of complications because some of the patients had multiple morbidity 
between september 1986 and december 1991 578 patients with primary invasive cervical cancer were referred to the departments of obstetrics and gynecology and radiation oncology at the istituto di scienze biomediche s gerardo university of milan monza 
adjuvant radiotherapy was done in 62 54 of the 114 surgery group patients who had a cervical diameter of 4 cm or smaller and in 46 84 of 55 surgery group patients who had a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm 19 patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or less and three patients whose cervical diameter was greater than 4 cm had lymph vascular space involvement as the only pathological risk factor these patients did not receive postoperative irradiation 
on the other hand the low rate of major complications after radiotherapy 12 suggests that this approach is well tolerated by most patients 25 of the surgery group patients and 26 patients in the radiotherapy group developed neoplastic recurrence 
eligibility criteria were age 30 70 years newly diagnosed stage ib or iia cervical cancer no concurrent or previous malignant disease who performance status of 1 or less and feasibility of both radical surgery and radiotherapy 
in the radiotherapy group one patient had intestinal perforation one rectovaginal fistula and 12 severe proctites severe oedema of the legs occurred in ten 9 patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy in one 0 6 patient who had radiotherapy alone and in none of the patients who had surgery alone 
of the 468 patients with figo stage ib or iia cervical cancer 125 were excluded because of age 30 years 70 years n 43 medical illness n 54 previous or concurrent malignant disease n 21 or the referring physician s or patient s preference for surgery radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy n 7 
of the 86 patients who developed a recurrence 50 58 had local or pelvic recurrence 22 52 in the surgery group vs 28 64 in the radiotherapy group p 0 42 and 36 42 had distant metastases 20 48 vs 16 36 p 0 62 five of these 36 patients also had a pelvic recurrence 
we classified complications as grade 1 mild symptoms not affecting the patient s health and easily cured grade 2 symptoms that can be resolved by long term medical therapies grade 3 major symptoms that require surgery or invasive procedures and affect the performance status of the patient or fatal complications 
the pelvic area including vagina and cervix when present was involved in 22 52 of 42 relapses after surgery and in 28 64 of 44 relapses after radiotherapy 
the clinical evaluation of the patients was done by the gynaecological surgeon together with the radiation oncologist to avoid bias in the randomisation in fact patients with unfavourable clinical characteristics are usually treated by radiotherapy alone 
thus 169 in the surgery group and 158 in the radiotherapy group underwent the scheduled treatment compliance of 98 for surgery and 92 for radiotherapy 
treatment was assigned by block randomisation clusters of ten cases of each stratum of cervical diameter from a computer generated table that had been created before the start of the study 
the pathologist provided us with histological subtypes grade depth of invasion tumour size presence of capillary like space involvement paracervical tissue involvement and number site and type of lymph node metastases 
after randomisation there were six protocol violations two in the surgery group one progression before operation and one refusal of any therapy after randomisation and four in the radiotherapy group two patients whose cancer was incorrectly staged and two with synchronous neoplasia 
we analysed the rate of complications by the actual treatment delivered to each patient so that we could assess accurately the type and cause of morbidity associated with each treatment 
the mean age of patients in the radiotherapy group was slightly greater than that of patients in the surgery group 
complications were classified according to the glossary of chassagne and colleagues 10 in the surgery group 48 28 patients showed severe grade 2 3 morbidity that required medical or surgical treatment compared with 19 12 patients in the radiotherapy group p 0 0004 table 3 
in our study 5 year actuarial survival was the same in the surgery and radiation groups 83 which suggests that there is no treatment of choice with respect to local control of disease 
of the 145 surgery group patients with negative lymphangiography 27 had nodal metastases which accounted for a specificity of 95 and a sensitivity of 40 
our main aim was to evaluate 5 year survival and the rate and pattern of complications and recurrences associated with each procedure
