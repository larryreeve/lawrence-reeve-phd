Based on the assumption that time to progression would be 6 months in the no-irinotecan group and 9 months in the irinotecan group ,  we calculated that 286 patients were needed to show a significant difference for this variable .
Moreover ,  irinotecan combined with fluorouracil and calcium folinate is the only treatment to show a survival advantage in metastatic colorectal cancer over high-dose continuous infusion fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone .
