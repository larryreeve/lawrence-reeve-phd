ALTHOUGH MANY PATIENTS with carcinoma of the uterine cervix are cured with local measures ,  a substantial minority recur or present with metastases and are potential candidates for systemic therapy .
Cisplatin is said to be the most active anticancer drug in cervical cancer ,  although 100 mg/m did not significantly improve the complete response (CR) rate compared prospectively with 50 mg/m (12.7 v 10% ,  respectively) and there was no appreciable difference in response duration ,  progression-free interval (PFI) ,  or survival.Thus ,  there is no convincing reason to use a cisplatindose higher than 50 mg/m .
A phase II study of the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) demonstrated activity formitolactol as a single agent in cervical cancer using 180mg/m/d for 10 days by mouth in repeated 4-week cycles.There were 55 assessable patients ,  with one CR and 15 partial responses (PRs) (29% response rate) .
Although an intermediate dose level (50 mg/m cisplatin and 225mg/m mitolactol daily for 5 days) was considered ,  it wasnot pursued ,  since six of 10 patients at the first dose level in the pilot study required dose reductions and/or delays with re-treatment .
The result was impressive ,  but the importance of bleomycin was unclear and its toxicity sometimes troublesome ,  so we proposed to compare cisplatin alone versus a regimen of cisplatinplus mitolactol (C + M) and a regimen of cisplatin plusifosfamide (and mesna) (CIFX) .
Eligible patients included women with histologically confirmed advanced (stage IVB) ,  recurrent ,  or persistent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix not suitable for curative treatment with surgery and/or radiotherapy .
Ineligible patients included those with cervical neoplasms other than squamous cell carcinoma or with nonmeasurable cervical cancer ,  WBC count less than 4,000/uL and/or platelet count less than 100,000/uL ,  abnormal liver function (bilirubin ,  AST ,  or alkaline phosphatase level > two times normal not related to the cancer) , bilateral hydronephrosis ,  GOG PS 3 or 4 ,  past or concomitant malignancy other than skin (excluding melanoma) ,  prior therapy with cytotoxic drugs except when used as a radiation sensitizer ,  radiationtherapy within 3 weeks of entry ,  lesions measurable only by ultrasound ,  or pregnancy or lactation .
Patients were prospectively stratified according to whether they had received prior radiation-sensitizer treatment (hydroxyurea ,  cisplatin , or fluorouracil) and by PS ,  and were then centrally randomized with equal probability to receive (1) cisplatin 50 mg/m with appropriate hydration every 3 weeks for a maximum of six courses ,  or (2) cisplatin 50 mg/m on day 1 plus mitolactol (180 mg/m orally for 5 days) on days 2 through 6 every 3 weeks ,  or (3) cisplatin 50mg/m plus ifosfamide 5.0 g/m over 24 hours plus mesna 6 g/m given concurrently with ifosfamide and for 12 hours after ,  every 3 weeks ,  again for a maximum of six courses .
The null hypothesis was rejected if the probability of the observed result ,  or a more extreme result ,  under the null hypothesis was less than 0.025 (one-tail test).A linear logistic model was used to adjust for age ,  PS ,  and whether cisplatin had been used as a radiosensitizer .
Between June 1990 and January 1994 ,  454 women entered the study of whom 16 were ineligible (wrong stage ,  n = 2 ,  wrong cell type ,  n = 9 ,  wrong primary tumor ,  n = 2 ,  prior chemotherapy ,  n = 2 ,  second primary tumor ,  n = 1) ,  which left 438 eligible patients (including 10 who received no drug ,  all were included in the intent to-treat analysis) .
Peripheral (P = .013) and central neurotoxicity (P = .001) were both significantly more frequent and severe with CIFX compared with cisplatin alone (Table 3) ,  but not so for C + M .
Subsequent patients were required to have a pretreatment serum albumin level >= 3.0 g/dL and aserum creatinine concentration within the institution'snormal limits ,  and patients with bilateral hydronephrosiswere ineligible .
These changes were based on a previous report that suggested low serum albumin level ,  high creatinine concentration ,  and the presence of pelvic tumor were correlated with severe encephalopathy .
PFS (Fig 1) adjusted for age ,  PS ,  and prior cisplatinas a radiosensitizer was statistically significantly longer for CIFX (median ,  4.6 v 3.2 months) compared with cisplatin alone (P = .003) ,  however ,  there was no difference between C + M and cisplatin alone .
There was no significant difference in survival between cisplatin and either of the combination regimens (median[months] ,  cisplatin ,  8.0 ,  C + M ,  7.3 ,  CIFX ,  8.3 ,  P =.835) (Fig 2) .
Initial PS (not shown) was also associated with survival (PS 0 was favorable ,  P < .001) ,  the median durations of survival for PS 0 ,  1 ,  and 2 were 10.0 ,  7.4 , and 6.8 months ,  respectively .
The results of this trial in cervix cancer reflect a common set of findings in combination chemotherapy of advanced solid tumors ,  namely ,  a higher response rate (but not a high CR rate) with a combination compared with single-agent therapy at the cost of more toxicity and no survival benefit .
Early experience in randomized phase II trials suggested that bleomycin and vincristine contributed importantly to combination regimens , but other randomized phase II trials have not supported a major role for these agents .
Although we are not aware of such complications in the present trial ,  the possible risk of secondary malignancies plus the failure to show an improvement in outcome for C + M would suggest a limited future for mitolactol in the treatment of cervix cancer .
It appears that studies are limited to a comparison of doxorubicin with or without vincristine and doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (n = 174) , with no difference in response rate ,  PFI ,  or survival ,  a comparison of cisplatin dose schedules ,  already referred to ,  a study of cisplatin infusion time (N = 331) ,  and a comparison of carboplatin versus iproplatin (N = 361) , with no difference in response rate ,  PFI ,  or survival .
A survival benefit was reported in a small trial (25 patients) in favor of cisplatin plus methotrexate over hydroxyurea , but prerandomization was used ,  PS was not accounted for ,  and there may have been other imbalances in the treatment arms that could account for the difference in outcome .
One of the earlier GOG trials showed an improved overall response rate (31.4% v 20.7% ,  P = .015) with double-dose cisplatin (100 mg/m2) ,  but no improvement in CR rate ,  PFI ,  or survival .
