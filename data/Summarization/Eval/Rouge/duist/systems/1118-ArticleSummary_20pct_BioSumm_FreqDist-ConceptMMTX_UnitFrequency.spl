While no therapy has been proven more effective than radical external-beam plus intracavitary radiotherapy ,  considerable research effort ,  including addition of chemotherapy plus radiation ,  is currently being put into improving survival rate in patients with advanced carcinoma of the cervix .
Thus ,  we designed the randomized trial to compare the tumor response and survival rate of patients with advanced cervical carcinoma receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus patients receiving radiotherapy alone .
From October 1990 to April 1995 ,  patients with advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix were entered on the study and randomly assigned to either radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy .
The patients could have no history of previous malignancy ,  chemotherapy ,  or radiotherapy .
Patients with documented disease beyond the pelvis were excluded ,  as were patients with positive paraaortic lymph nodes .
In the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group ,  chemotherapeutic regimens consisted of cisplatin (50 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously at the rate of 1 mg/min on Day 1) ,  vincristine (1 mg/m2 intravenously push on Day 2) ,  and bleomycin (25 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously infusion in divided doses on Days 2 ,  3 ,  and 4) which were given starting on Day 1 of radiotherapy and then every 3 weeks for a total of four courses .
The primary objectives were to compare the two treatment groups with respect to tumor response ,  failure patterns ,  disease-free interval ,  and actuarial survival .
The secondary objectives were to compare the two treatment groups with respect to treatment-related toxicities ,  treatment delays ,  and completeness .
All eligible patients were included in the analysis regardless of whether they completed the assigned treatment .
Among them ,  60 patients were randomized to the concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy ,  62 were randomized to the radiotherapy alone .
Of the chemoradiotherapy group ,  43 patients completed four courses of chemotherapy ,  11 patients received three courses ,  and 6 patients received two courses of chemotherapy .
The duration of the unplanned interruption was 1 week in 5 and 2 weeks in 2 ,  and 2 patients were unable to complete the planned radiotherapy .
Of the radiotherapy group ,  60 patients completed radiotherapy with no delays of treatment for toxicity ,  whereas the planned radiotherapy was interrupted for 1 week in 2 patients because of radiation protitis or neutropenia .
The duration of therapy for the patients was 59 days (range ,  49 ­ 78 days) versus 51 days (range ,  47 ­ 65 days) in the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups ,  respectively .
Acute (between initiation of therapy to 6 weeks after therapy) and late treatment-related toxicity (6 weeks after therapy) are listed in Tables 3 and 4 .
The acute treatment-related toxicity (grade 3 or 4) appears to be higher with the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group when compared with radiation group (36.7% versus 17.7% ,  P Å 0.02) .
The median time to pelvic recurrence was 15 months (range ,  7 ­ 19 months) ,  whereas the median time to distant recurrence was 21 months (range ,  12 ­ 33 months) .
Regarding patients with treatment incompleteness ,  those two patients who did not complete their planned treatment course because of treatment-related toxicity were dead of disease at 13 and 16 months .
Of the 9 patients requiring treatment delays ,  7 patients (77.8%) died of disease (5) or are alive with disease (2) ,  whereas 18 of the 49 patients (36.7%) who had completed their planned treatment without treatment delays died of disease or are alive with disease .
Analysis by Kaplan ­ Meier method showed that the actuarial survival was not statistically different between the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups (mean survival time ,  38.1 months versus 41.5 months ,  P Å 0.27) .
Therefore ,  the design of a more efficient treatment modality ,  such as the addition of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy ,  with the objective of increasing tumor control and long-term survival for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma ,  is advocated .
Therefore ,  in an attempt to improve tumor control and survival in patients with advanced cervical carcinoma ,  the treatment efficacy and tolerability of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy using cisplatin-based chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer needs to be explored .
Over the past few years ,  there have been multiple studies published which have retrospectively analyzed the outcome of patients with advanced cervical carcinoma who received concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
The published trials in advanced cervical carcinoma with concurrent chemoradiotherapy ,  either a single-agent weekly cisplatin or in combination with cisplatin ­ 5-FU or cisplatin ­ bleomycin ­ vincristine ,  yield tumor response rates of approximately 80% ,  and 3-year survival rates reached 50 to 60% of patients .
A later report of this group confirmed that the addition of cisplatin plus radiotherapy failed to show any significant improvement in long-term survival .
Our study also revealed that the patterns of recurrences were not changed by the concomitant therapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
The most likely explanation for the poor results in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group is the higher treatmentrelated toxicity ,  and that could limit the dose of definitive radiation employed or interrupt the planned radiotherapy .
Indeed ,  in our trial ,  the treatment-related toxicity was severe and resulted in delayed radiotherapy in 15% of patients after chemoradiotherapy ,  in which 77.8% of patients with treatment delays recurred or died of disease .
Additionally ,  the two patients who did not complete their planned treatment course died of disease .
In our trial ,  grade 3 or 4 treatment-related toxicities were observed more often on chemoradiotherapy than radiotherapy alone .
In conclusion ,  when comparing patients with concurrent therapy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to radiotherapy alone ,  our study showed that concurrent multiagent chemoradiotherapy did not prove to be a superior definitive therapy for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
