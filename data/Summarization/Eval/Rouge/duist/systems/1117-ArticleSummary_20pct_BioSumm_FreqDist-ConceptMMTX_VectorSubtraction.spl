Introduction .
Apart from Newton’s study about stage-I diseases ,  there have been no randomised studies to compare radiotherapy with radical surgery in one institution over a short period of time .
Between September ,  1986 ,  and December ,  1991 ,  578 patients with primary invasive cervical cancer were referred to the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Radiation Oncology ,  at the Istituto di Scienze Biomediche S Gerardo ,  University of Milan ,  Monza .
The codes were revealed after we had obtained the patient’s informed consent .
A boost of 5–10 Gy was given to the positive nodes .
Statistical analysis .
We used 2 test with Yates’ continuity correction to test the association between discrete variables .
We compared quantitative data by one-way analysis of variance .
A significance level of 95% was chosen .
Results .
The trial profile shows the flow of patients in the study (figure 1) .
Thus ,  343 patients were randomised ,  172 to radical surgery and 171 to radiotherapy .
We excluded these cases from the analysis .
There were no significant between-group differences in the distribution of factors affecting prognosis (table 1) .
Six of the 24 surgery-group patients showed no lymph-node metastasis in the surgical specimen .
Median follow-up was 87 (range 57–120) months .
Results of univariate and multivariate analysis are shown in table 4 .
Of these 86 patients ,  60 (70%) died of disease .
The median time to recurrence did not differ significantly between the surgery and radiotherapy groups (20 vs 18 months ,  p=0·24). 82% of pelvic recurrences and 61% of the distant ones became evident within 2 years of the primary treatment .
In particular ,  among radiotherapy-group patients with cervical diameter larger than 4 cm ,  the rate of pelvic relapse was more than twofold the rate of distant relapses (30% vs 13%) .
Thus ,  169 patients in the surgery group and 158 in the radiotherapy group were included in this analysis .
This accounts for an overall mortality rate of 0·6% .
Discussion .
Morley and Seski’s study ,  of 446 patients with stage-Ib disease recruited between 1945 and 1975 and treated with radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy or external irradiation and brachyradiotherapy ,  reported crude 5-year survival of 87% and 83% ,  respectively .
Shortening and fibrosis of the vagina can be limited if the woman is sexually active .
The women with a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm had the most unfavourable pathological prognostic factors and were at risk of a relapse independently from any other clinical factor .
These data are confirmed by other previous studies .
Adjuvant radiotherapy was prospectively planned in patients at high risk of relapse .
This finding should resolve some of the conflicting approaches to this issue.14–16 Our results suggest that the optimum candidates for primary radical surgery are women with normal ovarian function and cervical diameters of 4 cm or smaller ,  whereas radiotherapy is preferable for postmenopausal women .
