Apart from Newton’s study about stage-I diseases ,  there have been no randomised studies to compare radiotherapy with radical surgery in one institution over a short period of time .
Methods .
The median total dose of radiation was 47 (range 40–53) Gy during 3–5 weeks ,  depending on the tumour volume and nodal status .
After 2 weeks ,  one caesium-137 LDR insertion was carried out .
Patients who had at least one of the following pathological risk factors received adjuvant radiotherapy ,  surgical stage greater than pT2a ,  less than 3 mm of uninvolved cervical stroma ,  cutthrough ,  and lymph-node metastases .
We used 2 test with Yates’ continuity correction to test the association between discrete variables .
We compared quantitative data by one-way analysis of variance .
Results .
We excluded these cases from the analysis .
These cases were analysed according to the original group they were allocated to (intention to treat) .
The mean age of patients in the radiotherapy group was slightly greater than that of patients in the surgery group .
Survival and recurrence .
Median follow-up was 87 (range 57–120) months .
Results of univariate and multivariate analysis are shown in table 4 .
Six patients were still alive with disease 4–18 months after the diagnosis of relapse .
Three patients with recurrence died of intercurrent disease (one after successful treatment of the recurrence) .
The median time to recurrence did not differ significantly between the surgery and radiotherapy groups (20 vs 18 months ,  p=0·24). 82% of pelvic recurrences and 61% of the distant ones became evident within 2 years of the primary treatment .
Positioning of ureteral catheter or nephtostomy was needed ,  respectively ,  in two (100%) ,  three (27%) ,  and five (62%) patients with hydroureteronephrosis in the three above-mentioned groups .
Discussion .
Morley and Seski’s study ,  of 446 patients with stage-Ib disease recruited between 1945 and 1975 and treated with radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy or external irradiation and brachyradiotherapy ,  reported crude 5-year survival of 87% and 83% ,  respectively .
These rates suggest that both treatments are equally effective for early-stage cancers (Ib and IIa) .
Radical hysterectomy allows the gonadal function of at least one ovary to be saved ,  thereby avoiding the effects of early menopause in younger women .
Shortening and fibrosis of the vagina can be limited if the woman is sexually active .
The women with a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm had the most unfavourable pathological prognostic factors and were at risk of a relapse independently from any other clinical factor .
Adjuvant radiotherapy was prospectively planned in patients at high risk of relapse .
In Italy ,  a prospective randomised trial has been under way since 1993 to assess the best adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) for high-risk patients after radical surgery for FIGO stage Ib–IIa cancer .
This finding should resolve some of the conflicting approaches to this issue.14–16 Our results suggest that the optimum candidates for primary radical surgery are women with normal ovarian function and cervical diameters of 4 cm or smaller ,  whereas radiotherapy is preferable for postmenopausal women .
The latter approach offers the advantages of surgery ,  and the neoadjuvant chemotherapy will keep to a minimum the risk of extracervical spread of the tumour withoutcombining surgery and radiotherapy .
An Italian prospective randomised trial of radical radiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery in patients with squamous neoplasia and cervical diameters larger than 4 cm has been in progress since 1991 .
