Intestinal anastomosis has been successfully performed for more than 150 years using a variety of techniques ,  materials ,  and devices .
METHODS .
All adult patients requiring intestinal anastomosis at Denver Health Medical Center from September 1996 to September 1999 were considered eligible .
Patients were also excluded if the surgeon did not believe that either technique could be used because of technical concerns such as edema or scarring .
Calculations of the length of stay used the number of patients for the denominator .
All procedures were performed by postgraduate year 3 to 5 residents from the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center assisted by an attending surgeon ,  or by the attending surgeons themselves .
Continuous data were analyzed using the Student t test .
P < .05 was considered to indicate statistical significance .
Fifty-nine patients were randomized to single-layer anastomoses and 66 to two-layer anastomoses .
For six patients who required more than one anastomosis ,  the same method was used for each anastomosis .
This resulted in 65 single-layer continuous and 67 two-layer interrupted anastomoses .
DISCUSSION .
Since then ,  the technique has remained essentially unchanged except for the evolution of suture material for the inner layer .
The single-layer interrupted anastomosis was never entirely abandoned and has periodically attracted renewed interest .
In the United States ,  the first mention of this technique was by Allen et al , 18 who presented their results with its use before the Texas Surgical Society in 1979 .
These results also imply that the technique can be safely introduced into a surgical training program without a painful learning curve .
The ultimate test of the suitability of a technique for intestinal anastomosis is its ability to heal without leakage .
Further ,  most of the anastomoses in this study were performed by residents ,  who were often unfamiliar with the technique or were performing their first intestinal anastomosis .
Another factor is related to the properties of a continuous monofilament plastic suture line .
We did not believe we could realistically enroll this many patients ,  instead ,  a multiinstitutional trial would be necessary .
