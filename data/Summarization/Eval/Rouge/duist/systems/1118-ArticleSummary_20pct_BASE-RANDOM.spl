The incidence of failure to control pelvic disease following radical irradiation is about 40% .
This is associated with a high incidence of distant metastasis ,  in which 30% of patients subsequently developed metastases either alone or in combination with pelvic failure .
The rationale for adding chemotherapy to pelvic radiation is to provide systemic cytotoxic agents active against cervical cancer with the potential to enhance the radiosensitivity ,  to enhance local tumor control ,  and to eradicate micrometastasis .
The use of concurrent chemoradiotherapy has shown promising therapeutic results in a variety of tumors .
The trial compared the efficacy and tolerability of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer .
Patients .
Pretreatment evaluation included a complete medical history and physical examination ,  complete blood count ,  serum electrolytes ,  chemistry profile ,  tumor markers ,  chest X ray ,  an electrocardiogram ,  and contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis .
Patients with documented disease beyond the pelvis were excluded ,  as were patients with positive paraaortic lymph nodes .
In the radiation group ,  patients received external beam X-ray treatment followed by intracavitary brachytherapy .
The local response to treatment was evaluated at 1 month after completion of therapy by physical examination and abdominopelvic computerized tomography .
Toxicity of chemotherapy was assessed before each course .
Differences in survival rates were assessed by the log-rank test .
Comparisons of variables between groups were based on the x2 test .
A total of 122 patients with advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix were entered and all were eligible for follow-up evaluation .
A tumor response was observed in 88.4% (53/60) of the patients in concurrent group and in 74.2% (46/62) of the patient s in radiotherapy group .
Toxicity .
An analysis of the patterns of failure reveals that the incidence of pelvic failure was equally distributed between the treatment groups (31.7% versus 30.6% ,  P Å 0.93) .
Figures 1 and 2 show the 3-year disease-free and overall survival curves for the two groups .
Analysis by Kaplan ­ Meier method showed that the actuarial survival was not statistically different between the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups (mean survival time ,  38.1 months versus 41.5 months ,  P Å 0.27) .
Radiation effects are dependent on well-oxygenated tumor cells .
The problem of enhanced pelvic control cannot be approached simply by increasing radiation doses because of the additional complications produced by conventional radiation .
To date ,  cisplatin is one of the most active drugs tested in this tumor .
In addition ,  the possibility of synergistic action between radiation and chemotherapy may lead to increased tumor cell kill .
Therefore ,  to test the hypothesis of concurrent chemoradiotherapy improving the survival rate of advanced cervical cancer ,  in 1990 we began a phase III randomized trial comparing concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus pelvic radiation alone in patients with advanced cervical carcinoma at our institution .
To further increase the systemic activity and the radiation-enhancing potential of the chemotherapy ,  we chose cisplatin-based regimens with vincristine and bleomycin in this trial because it had proven high efficacy of local control in our previous phase I and II trials for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
Our study also revealed that the patterns of recurrences were not changed by the concomitant therapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
The pelvis is still the predominant site of failure in around 30% .
However ,  a high proportion of patients who failed in this trial had a component of distant failure .
Indeed ,  in our trial ,  the treatment-related toxicity was severe and resulted in delayed radiotherapy in 15% of patients after chemoradiotherapy ,  in which 77.8% of patients with treatment delays recurred or died of disease .
Some authors have reported that clonogen repopulation in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region accelerates after radiotherapy .
The accelerated repopulation in the treatment may involve only a small number of surviving cells ,  which could be omitted by posttreatment investigations .
