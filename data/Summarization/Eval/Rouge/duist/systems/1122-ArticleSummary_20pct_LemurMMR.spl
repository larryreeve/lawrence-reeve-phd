in the second arm of the study patients were randomized to treatment with a similar regimen of chemotherapy as described above without pelvic radiation following the first two cycles of cisplatin and bleomycin the patient then received the third and fourth treatment of cisplatin alone at 3 to 4 week intervals 
the preferred treatment of women with early stage cervical cancer figo ia2 iia is radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy 
the advantages of eliminating the radiation therapy component of postoperative therapy are apparent in that the duration of treatment is shorter costs are reduced and the long term side effects of pelvic radiotherapy after radical pelvic surgery are eliminated 
the analysis of the data from the 89 patients entered is not able to document that the two treatments are equivalent but must be taken to suggest that the likelihood of finding a significant difference between these two treatment modalities in a full trial of 160 patients is small 
patients with recurrent disease were classified by the site of recurrence and the interval from the date of radical hysterectomy to the date of recurrence 
patients with clinical stage ib iia cancer of the uterine cervix treated by radical hysterectomy bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and aortic lymph node sampling were eligible for entry into this prospective study if they had one or more of the following risk factors 1 metastatic disease to pelvic lymph nodes 2 large primary tumors greater than or equal to 4 cm in diameter 3 deeply invasive lesions with 75 or greater stromal invasion 4 nonsquamous histology and or 5 occult parametrial involvement or positive surgical margins 
four patients randomized to chemotherapy plus radiation refused either the radia to follow up or had no follow up data available for analysis tion therapy n 3 or had a major violation in the radiation thus there were 33 patients who received the combination therapy treatment plan when intravaginal radiation therapy of chemotherapy and pelvic radiation and 39 who received was administered and she did not receive the last 2 cycles chemotherapy alone who could be evaluated for disease of cisplatin n 1 free and overall survival 
however among patients with a clinically early cancer there are prognostic features which identify patients at increased risk for recurrence recurrent cervical cancer after initial radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy has a poor prognosis with a reported 5 year survival rate of 5 or less 
a retrospective study of patients undergoing radical hysterectomy at memorial sloan kettering cancer center mskcc from 1939 to 1977 identified the following risk factors metastatic tumor to the pelvic lymph nodes large cervical tumor parametrial extension of disease nonsquamous or grade 3 histology and deep 75 cervical stromal invasion 
seventy five patients had a stage ib cervical cancer risk factors and 64 had 1 to 2 risk factors 33 of these patients and the remaining 14 patients had a stage iia cancer 
twelve of the 19 recurrences were either local recurrences only or local plus distant metastases with no difference in the number of local occurrences between the two treatment arms 
in an effort to determine whether the improved survival in the memorial hospital phase ii trial was due to the combination of chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation therapy or due to the effect of the chemotherapy alone a multicenter randomized phase iii clinical trial was designed 
the rationale for adding radiation therapy 1 patient received 3780 cgy of 4500 cgy chemotherapy to the pelvic radiation is to provide systemic cytotoxic agents active against cervical cancer with the potential to eradicate micrometastasis 
the initial accrual goal of the trial was 160 patients with 80 patients randomized to each of the two treatment arms 
one patient developed radiation proctitis re has been no significant difference in disease free survival requiring a colostomy after completion of the prescribed dose between the two treatment groups fig 2 10 patients in of pelvic radiation therapy the chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation therapy arm have experienced recurrences compared to 9 recurrences in the 
there were 12 major protocol viola patients received only a portion of the proscribed treatment tions including 7 patients who were randomized 6 to che one patient randomized to chemotherapy withdrew after chemotherapy plus radiation therapy and 1 patient to chemother experiencing an allergic bleomycin reaction during the initial chemotherapy alone and then either refused treatment n 6 or were infusion of bleomycin during cycle 1
