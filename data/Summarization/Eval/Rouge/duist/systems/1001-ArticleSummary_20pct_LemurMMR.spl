the multicenter study consisted of six academic centers in former west germany a total of 189 patients were randomized with the first patient entered in may 1985 and the last in apnl 1990 the study was closed in december 1992 and we present here the final status with median follow up data of 7 years eligible patients were required to have histologically confirmed adenocarcmoma of colon or the rectum with spread to regional lymph nodes dukes c or international unimon agamst cancer uicc stage iii in addition hlstopathologic confirmation of curative resection r0 was secured radical tumor resection was performed by a standardized technique agreed upon by all participating centers when located within 15 cm of the anal verge a tumor was classified as rectal carcinoma patients were less than 70 years old and had a karnofsky index greater than 50 eleven of 99 patients randomized to treatment refused their treatment assignment but were otherwise considered eligible for the study 
purpose as previously shown antibody treatment increased survival of patients with resected colorectal cancer of stage dukes c 
here we report on the 7 year follow up study of this prospective randomized two arm trial in minimal residual disease that used the murine 17 1a antibody 4 which recognizes a 34 kd glycoprotein of the cell membrane of epithelial cells 5 the 5 year analysis had shown that a short albeit intensive postoperative course of antibody treatment 900 mg total dose significantly reduced the appearance of distant metastases but did not affect the rate of local relapses 
patients and methods a total of 189 patients with resected dukes c colorectal cancer were randomly allocated to infusions of a total of 900 mg 17 1a antibody 500 mg postoperatively followed by 4 monthly doses of 100 mg n 99 or to observation only n 90 
all patients were stratified according to zelen 8 by the following factors participating center sex location of tumor stage dukes cl or c2 equivalent to pn1 or pn2 3 number of affected lymph nodes and carcinoembryonic antigen cea level before surgery table 1 in the treated arm more patients had pt2 and pt3 tumors and fewer had pt4 tumors however treated patients appeared to have had higher numbers of involved lymph nodes pn2 and tumors of less differentiated histology grade 3 
however a fishers exact test companng the distnbutlon of patients according to all prognostic variables showed no significant differences randomlzation before consent was performed and evaluated according to zelen 9 on approval by legal experts in 1985 this procedure was accepted by the ethical review board statistical analyses were performed according to sas statistical analysis system cary nc to test for potential selection bias in the study a retrospective analysis was performed at medizimnische hochschule hannover on 67 dukes c colorectal cancer patients selected from 107 patients seen between 1980 and 1985 they fulfilled the entry criteria for the 17 1a clinical trial and were monitored for at least 5 years each the survival analysis was performed by the instutut fur medlzinische informatlk und blomathematlk umversltat essen the overall survival according to kaplan meier curve is nearly identical to the control group of the 17 1a trial log rank p 97 thus this historical control does not show any selection bias 
in summary 46 of patients 41 of 90 in the treatment group are at nsk at 7 years and only 29 of patients 22 of 76 m the observed group are alive without recurrence 
as shown in table 2 there is an excess of local recurrences in the treatment group which may partially be explained by the longer survival of treated patients 
in contrast to other trials aimed at patients with larger metastatic tumor masses and using regression or shrinkage as the end point this one on colorectal cancer of stage dukes c required microscopically complete resection of the primary tumor for patients to be admitted 3 as the primary end point overall survival was determined at 5 years 
as recently shown for breast carcinoma without regional radiation therapy occult local metastases can give rise to distant metastases after many years and thus affect long term survival 6 7 therefore with no effect of antibody therapy on the local relapse at 5 years it was of interest to know how the overall survival evolved at the 7 year follow up evaluation 
the death rate of the observed group was 63 48 of 76 95 ci range 48 to 78 of patients and that of the treated group was 43 39 of 90 95 ci range 31 to 58 
it is safe to assume that antigenic heterogeneity a likely consequence of the marked genomic instability of human epithelial tumors will be a major obstacle for single antibody treatments as well as for any other form of monotherapy 
as the 7 year median follow up data confirm the previously reported 5 year findings the conclusion seems warranted that antibody treatment improves the chances of curatively operated patients 
for the end point analysis standardized and objectively verifiable dates were used for all patients e time point of surgery up to death of all cause or date of last contact alive for overall survival analysis in a separate analysis cancer related mortality was assessed e death without recurrence was not counted as an event 
the kaplanmeier survival curves fig 1a showed a significant benefit for patients who received antibody over those who did not receive treatment p 01 with cox s proportional hazard model corrected for influence of prognostic variables and p 01 with log rank test for the univariate analysis 
one of these trials performed in europe and israel includes a confirmatory arm with antibody as single treatment with the other two arms applying chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus antibody respectively 
after confirmation of histology and r0 resection of lymph node metastasis patients were randomized into two groups one received 17 la treatment whereas the other served as observation controls 
this view is supported by the immediate gastrointestinal toxicity such as abdominal cramps nausea and transient diarrhea observed in a substantial proportion of patients shortly after infusion of the antibody 
however this argument rests on the assumption that the antibody exerts its antitumor effect by mobilization of direct effector mechanisms that are active only as long as the antibody is bound to the target 
on the other hand the peculiar immunogenicity of the murine antibody may be important for the recruitment of human t cells as mediators of an indirect antitumor effect 
therefore in anticipation of antigenic heterogeneity a combination therapy that consists of antibodies of different specificities may forestall a selection of antigen negative cells exerted inevitably by a one antibody approach 
since the 5 year analysis was criticized because of the wide range 2 7 to 7 5 years of follow up time we performed a 7 year analysis with only four of 189 patients monitored for less than 5 years 
some patients have now been monitored for 10 years and only five patients were observed for a period of less than 5 years with a range of 3 5 to 4 5 years 
according to the disease free interval analysis tumor recurred in 96 of 166 eligible patients after 7 years of follow up evaluation thus three more recurrences were recorded m the treatment group and one more in the observation arm 
antibody treatment increased time to recurrence p 04 with cox proportional hazards model corrected for influence of prognostic variables and p 07 with log rank test for umvanate analysis 
when the analyses of recurrence free interval and recurrence free survival were performed including all randomized patients ie according to intention to treat 17 1a treatment again led to significant advantage over the untreated group cox multivanate p 02 log rank p 01 respectively 
why only one third of the patients at risk have responded to the antibody treatment may be explained by variations in accessibility vulnerability and or antigen expression in individual disseminated tumor cells 
when tested for antibody response against murine antibody hama 80 of treated patients developed a distinct hama response after the second or third nfusion 
this differential effect of 17 1a antibody on disseminated isolated tumor cells versus occult local satellites may explain the increased significance seen in the overall survival 
conclusion the now matured study shows that 17 1a antibody administered after surgery prevents the development of distant metastasis in approximately one third of patients
