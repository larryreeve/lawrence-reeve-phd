The aim was to increase the number of patients in whom curative resection could be done ,  and so improve survival rates .
The dose of radiation (40 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks) was chosen as the highest that was deemed safe before anterior resection with the wide-field technique proposed .
We present the results of this trial with a minimum follow-up time for surviving patients of 5 years .
When an eligible patient was enrolled ,  the randomised treatment allocation was obtained by means of a telephone call to the MRC Cancer Trials Office in Cambridge .
Megavoltage radiotherapy was started as soon as possible after randomisation .
Two parallel opposed fields 18 cm by 15 cm were positioned to cover the tumour with an adequate proximal margin (normally 5 cm). 20 daily fractions of 2 Gy at the mid-plane central axis of the volume of the tumour were given over 4 weeks .
For the analyses the date of first local recurrence was taken as the date of the first new clinical or histological evidence of local recurrence ,  we included an assessment of clinical evidence of local recurrence at death .
Based on accrual to the previous MRC preoperative radiotherapy trial ,  we expected that this number would be accrued in 4 to 5 years .
Proportions were compared by the  2 test ,  and ordered categorical data by the Mann-Whitney test .
Results .
125 (90%) patients received the planned dose of 40 Gy over 4 weeks .
Three patients allocated surgery alone were considered unfit for surgery .
However ,  the number of lymph nodes examined was lower in the radiotherapy group .
Again ,  there was no evidence of an increased number of late complications in the radiotherapy group ,  two patients in each treatment group still had complications of the abdominal wounds 12 months after surgery .
A reduction in the risk of metastatic recurrence was found which was ,  rather unexpectedly ,  of a similar order to the reduction in local recurrence (hazard ratio 0.66 [0.46-0.95] ,  log-rank p=0.02) .
Consistent with the results of the individual endpoints ,  results for disease-free survival also suggest a benefit to the radiotherapy patients (hazard ratio 0.76 [0.58-1.0] ,  log-rank p=0.05) .
Although less than two thirds of the planned sample size was achieved ,  217 (86%) of the 251 deaths anticipated ,  if the planned 450 patients had been entered and followed up for 3 years ,  have occurred .
Fewer deaths were reported to have been from colorectal cancer or complications of the disease or its treatment among patients allocated preoperative radiotherapy than among those allocated surgery alone (85 vs 103 ,  hazard ratio 0.71 [0.54-0.97] ,  p=0.02) .
This estimate indicates a substantial decrease in the risk of death from colorectal cancer in patients allocated radiotherapy ,  although the data are compatible with a halving of the risk of death from colorectal cancer at one extreme or as little as 3% reduction in risk at the other .
Discussion .
Failure to recruit the planned number of patients is reflected in the wide 95% CI seen for each of the main endpoints .
In the earlier trial surgeons were asked only to record their preoperative findings with respect to fixity ,  but in this trial they were asked to base a crucial decision on type of treatment on these observations .
The case for preoperative adjuvant radiotherapy has been supported by several trials published since this trial started ,  including the European trial reported by Gerard and colleagues .
None of these studies has concentrated specifically on locally advanced tumours .
