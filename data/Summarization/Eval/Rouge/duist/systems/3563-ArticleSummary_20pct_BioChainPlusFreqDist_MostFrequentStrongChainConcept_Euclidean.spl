Because of these potential advantages ,  we hypothesized that the single-layer technique could be introduced into our surgical teaching program with no increase in anastomotic failure and that it could be performed in less time than the two-layer technique .
METHODS .
Patients were also excluded if the surgeon did not believe that either technique could be used because of technical concerns such as edema or scarring .
Patients were assigned to either the one-or two-layer technique in a prospective ,  randomized fashion .
Opaque ,  sealed envelopes indicating the technique to be used were placed in the operating room and were drawn sequentially when the need for intestinal anastomosis became apparent .
The study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board ,  which also granted a waiver of consent because both methods were in common use in our institution and had similar results .
All two-layer anastomoses were constructed using interrupted 3.0 silk Lembert sutures for the outer layer and a running 3.0 polyglycolic acid suture for the transmural inner layer .
Each stitch was advanced approximately 5 mm. To avoid ischemia of the anastomosis ,  the surgeon had to ensure that only enough pressure was applied to the suture while following to approximate the ends of the bowel and render the anastomosis watertight .
For two-layer anastomoses ,  three packets of 3.0 silk sutures ,  each containing five needled sutures ,  and two packets of 3.0 polyglycolic acid sutures were used .
For six patients who required more than one anastomosis ,  the same method was used for each anastomosis .
This resulted in 65 single-layer continuous and 67 two-layer interrupted anastomoses .
Since then ,  the technique has remained essentially unchanged except for the evolution of suture material for the inner layer .
The single-layer interrupted anastomosis was never entirely abandoned and has periodically attracted renewed interest .
These results also imply that the technique can be safely introduced into a surgical training program without a painful learning curve .
Ischemia ,  tension on the anastomosis ,  and poor technique are clearly responsible for anastomotic failure and are all under the direct control of the surgeon .
Other traditional risk factors such as diabetes ,  steroids ,  anastomotic method ,  blood loss ,  and nutritional factors have not clearly been predictive of anastomotic failure .
In fact ,  the only technique that has been unequivocally demonstrated to be unacceptable is the everted anastomosis .
This time has been documented by other surgeons using the single-layer continuous method .
Even more dramatic is the difference in cost when compared with a stapled anastomosis ,  the disposable staple gun costs $115.26 and two refills cost an additional $123.54 ,  for a total of $238.80! .
In today’s cost-conscious environment ,  the use of staples for anastomoses seems irresponsible if a hand-sewn anastomosis can also be safely used in a similar time interval .
