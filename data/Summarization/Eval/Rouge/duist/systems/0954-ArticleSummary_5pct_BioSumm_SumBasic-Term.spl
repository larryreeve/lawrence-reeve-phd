After written informed consent was obtained ,  the patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups ,  those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy plus locoregional radiotherapy in five fields (the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group ,  with 164 patients) and those receiving chemotherapy alone (the chemotherapy group ,  with 154 patients) .
Also ,  as part of a second randomization ,  68 patients with estrogen-positive tumors were treated with radiationinduced ovarian ablation that included 20 Gy over a period of five days plus prednisone (7.5 mg per day) for two years ,  as described by Meakin et al. Among these 68 patients ,  33 were assigned to chemotherapy and 35 were assigned to chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
There was an overall reduction of 34 percent in the rate of systemic recurrence (relative risk ,  0.66 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.49 to 0.89 ,  P 0.006) in the group treated with combined therapy (75 of 164 patients vs. 94 of 154 patients in the group treated only with chemotherapy) ,  and a 17-percentage-point improvement in systemic disease-free survival (Fig. 2) .
The meta-analysis performed by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group , 1 which analyzed all the randomized radiation trials begun before 1985 ,  found a 67 percent reduction in rates of locoregional relapse (P 0.001) and a 6 percent reduction in mortality from breast cancer (P 0.03) ,  but no improvement in overall survival .
Locoregional radiation is not routinely used atpresent in patients with node-positive breast cancer ,  although it is coming into use to treat patients with 10 or more positive nodes and occasionally those with 4 or more positive nodes .
