From May ,  1997 ,  to February ,  1998 ,  we enrolled patients who met the following eligibility criteria ,  histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum ,  age 18-75 years ,  WHO performance status of 2 or less and life expectancy of more than 3 months ,  haemoglobin 100 g/L or more ,  absolute neutrophil count 2.0 10/L ,  platelets 150 10/L or more ,  creatinine 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal ,  total bilirubin 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal ,  aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 3.0 or less times the upper limit of normal (if liver metastases present ,  1.5 or less times for bilirubin and 5.0 or less times for aspartate and alanine aminotransferases) ,  and no previous (other than adjuvant) chemotherapy ,  finished more than 6 months before randomisation .
We needed to include 338 evaluable patients to show a significant difference in response rate between treatment groups ,  assuming response rates of 35% in the no-irinotecan group and 50% in the irinotecan group ,  by use of two-tailed X tests (a=0.05 ,  power 0.80) .
For time to progression ,  Cox's proportional hazards modelling was used ,  with the following variables ,  sex ,  age (<58 and <=58 years) ,  WHO performance status (<2 and >= 2) ,  weight loss (<=5% and >5%) ,  number of organs involved (<3 and >=3) ,  primary tumour site (colon or rectum) ,  liver involvement ,  lymph-node involvement ,  time from first diagnosis to first metastasis (0-3 ,  >3.12 ,  >12 months) ,  previous surgery ,  previous adjuvant therapy ,  time from first diagnosis and first infusion (<9 and <=9 months) .
Similar proportions of patients received further treatment with oxaliplatin in the two groups (15.7 vs 12.8%) .
The effect of treatment was significant (p<0.001) ,  the Survival in the irinotecan group was significantly longer hazard ratio for response was 2.6 times higher in the than in the no-irinotecan group (median 17.4 [0.4-28.4+] irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group ,  given the same degree of weight loss at baseline and the same time between first diagnosis and first metastasis .
In the irinotecan group ,  diarrhoea and neutropenia were the most common toxic effects in each regimen ,  and were significantly more frequent and severe than in the noirinotecan group .
One patient treated with the irinotecan combination on the 2-weekly regimen did not receive appropriate therapy for the management of diarrhoea and died early in the first cycle ,  probably because of septic shock concomitant with grade 4 neutropenia .
The results we achieved with the irinotecan combination treatment show that the addition of irinotecan to weekly or 2-weekly regimens of fluorouracil and calcium folinate by infusion brings clear clinical benefit and should be considered as a first-line reference treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer as well as for advanced disease .
