The principal toxicity of mitolactol is hematologic ,  while that of cisplatin is nonhematologic .
The combination of DAG and cisplatin has previously been studied .
A pilot study used mitolactol plus cisplatin and established a tolerable dose schedule of 180 mg/m of mitolactoldaily for 5 days with cisplatin 50 mg/m .
Although an intermediate dose level (50 mg/m cisplatin and 225mg/m mitolactol daily for 5 days) was considered ,  it wasnot pursued ,  since six of 10 patients at the first dose level in the pilot study required dose reductions and/or delays with re-treatment .
Treatment of cervix cancer with the combination of ifosfamide ,  cisplatin ,  and bleomycin yielded a 69% response rate (49 patients) in one series .
PATIENTS AND METHODS .
Ten patients did not receive the randomized study treatment .
RESULTS .
Patient pretreatment characteristics were well balanced among the three arms (Table 1) .
Toxicity .
Subsequent patients were required to have a pretreatment serum albumin level >= 3.0 g/dL and aserum creatinine concentration within the institution'snormal limits ,  and patients with bilateral hydronephrosiswere ineligible .
Response and Survival .
There was a significantly greater frequency of response(31.1%) among patients treated with CIFX compared with cisplatin alone (17.8%; P = .004; Table 4) .
There was no significant difference in survival between cisplatin and either of the combination regimens (median[months]: cisplatin ,  8.0; C + M ,  7.3; CIFX ,  8.3; P =.835) (Fig 2) .
Histologic grade and prior radiotherapy were not significantly associated with survival .
As a consequence ,  a subset of patients in the present study had such a prior history (Table 1) .
The results of this trial in cervix cancer reflect a common set of findings in combination chemotherapy of advanced solid tumors ,  namely ,  a higher response rate (but not a high CR rate) with a combination compared with single-agent therapy at the cost of more toxicity and no survival benefit .
A phase II trial of bleomycin plus ifosfamide plus cisplatin that used the same dose schedules of CIFX as in the present trial achieved a 20% CR rate .
There is a paucity of phase III chemotherapy trials in advanced cervix cancer .
It appears that studies are limited to a comparison of doxorubicin with or without vincristine and doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (n = 174) , with no difference in response rate ,  PFI ,  or survival; a comparison of cisplatin dose schedules ,  already referred to; a study of cisplatin infusion time (N = 331); and a comparison of carboplatin versus iproplatin (N = 361) , with no difference in response rate ,  PFI ,  or survival .
The methotrexate ,  vinblastine ,  doxorubicin , cisplatin (MVAC) regimen ,  popularized in the treatment of transitional cell bladder cancer ,  has recently been reported to be active in cervix cancer .
Cisplatin alone has limited value in advanced cervix cancer; we are not aware of a randomized trial of cisplatin versus supportive care .
One of the earlier GOG trials showed an improved overall response rate (31.4% v 20.7%; P = .015) with double-dose cisplatin (100 mg/m2) ,  but no improvement in CR rate ,  PFI ,  or survival .
In contrast ,  the present trial ,  which used cisplatin 50 mg/m2 plus ifosfamide ,  has shown an impact on PFS .
