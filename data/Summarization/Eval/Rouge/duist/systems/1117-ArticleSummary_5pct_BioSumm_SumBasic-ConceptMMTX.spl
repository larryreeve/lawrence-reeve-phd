All patients received standard pretreatment evaluation ,  which included complete blood analysis ,  intravenous pyelogram ,  lymphangiography ,  cystoscopy ,  chest radiography ,  and other tests when indicated .
We used the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) clinical staging system to classify the stage of cancer.7 If there was disagreement about the stage ,  the case was assigned to the earlier stage. 468 patients had FIGO stage Ib or IIa disease. 343 of these patients were enrolled after they had given their informed consent to take part .
Radiotherapy included ,  external pelvic irradiation with 18 MV photon beam by the multiportal technique ,  one dose of 1820Gy at the isocentre ,  and two or more portals treated daily .
We used multivariate Cox regression analysis to assess the effect of cervical size ,  age ,  FIGO state ,  histological type ,  grade of differentiation ,  radiological lymph-node status ,  and treatment group on overall survival .
Other vesical complications (severe actinic cystitis ,  stress incontinence ,  high-pressure bladder) were recorded in two (3%) patients after surgery ,  11 (10%) after surgery plus radiotherapy ,  and in eight (5%) after radiotherapy alone .
In our study ,  5-year actuarial survival was the same in the surgery and radiation groups (83%) ,  which suggests that there is no treatment of choice with respect to local control of disease .
In our experience ,  the combination of surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy carries the worst morbidity ,  especially long-term (delayed in onset) complications ,  that are difficult to record during the follow-up .
Women whose cervical diameters are larger than 4 cm should be identified before surgery so that they can benefit from tailored treatment ,  radical radiotherapy ,  with the option of concomitant radiosensitising chemotherapy to improve the local control of the disease ,  or cisplatinbased chemotherapy followed by radical surgery .
