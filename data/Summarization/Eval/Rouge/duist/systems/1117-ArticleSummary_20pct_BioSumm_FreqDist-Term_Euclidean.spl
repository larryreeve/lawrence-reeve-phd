Introduction .
Methods .
Between September ,  1986 ,  and December ,  1991 ,  578 patients with primary invasive cervical cancer were referred to the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Radiation Oncology ,  at the Istituto di Scienze Biomediche S Gerardo ,  University of Milan ,  Monza .
A boost of 5–10 Gy was given to the positive nodes .
In all cases ,  a lower midline incision was made ,  which skirted the umbilicus and extended to the cephalad when indicated .
The secondary outcome measure was recurrence of the disease .
Statistical analysis .
No interim analysis was done .
We used 2 test with Yates’ continuity correction to test the association between discrete variables .
We compared quantitative data by one-way analysis of variance .
Survival curves were calculated by the life-table method and compared by the log-rank test .
A significance level of 95% was chosen .
Survival and relapses were analysed by intention to treat .
Results .
We excluded these cases from the analysis .
Survival and recurrence .
Median follow-up was 87 (range 57–120) months .
Results of univariate and multivariate analysis are shown in table 4 .
Of these 86 patients ,  60 (70%) died of disease .
Complications .
This accounts for an overall mortality rate of 0·6% .
Discussion .
Morley and Seski’s study ,  of 446 patients with stage-Ib disease recruited between 1945 and 1975 and treated with radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy or external irradiation and brachyradiotherapy ,  reported crude 5-year survival of 87% and 83% ,  respectively .
Age is also an important factor ,  in most cases ,  cervical carcinomas occur in middle-aged women .
Radical hysterectomy allows the gonadal function of at least one ovary to be saved ,  thereby avoiding the effects of early menopause in younger women .
Shortening and fibrosis of the vagina can be limited if the woman is sexually active .
Most complications can be easily corrected .
These data are confirmed by other previous studies .
This finding should resolve some of the conflicting approaches to this issue.14–16 Our results suggest that the optimum candidates for primary radical surgery are women with normal ovarian function and cervical diameters of 4 cm or smaller ,  whereas radiotherapy is preferable for postmenopausal women .
