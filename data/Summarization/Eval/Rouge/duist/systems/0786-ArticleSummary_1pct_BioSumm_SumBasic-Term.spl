As in the disease-free analysis ,  secondary analyses of survival considering either all patients randomized or only patients who received treatment after the completion of radiation therapy ,  resulted in no meaningful change in direction or magnitude of the RR attributed to treatment with the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen (RR = 1.10 ,  95% CI ,  .72 to 1.67 ,  and RR = 1.04 ,  95% CI ,  .65 to 1.67 ,  respectively) .
The results of this study indicate that treatment after surgical resection of Dukes B2 and C rectal cancer with escalating 5-FU postradiation therapy provides similar survival and recurrence outcomes as a postradiation chemotherapeutic regimen including the leukemogen MeCCNU .
