One of 2 large multi-institutional phase III studies published around the same time that show that adding irinotecan to 5FU as the primary treatment of advanced colorectal cancer can increase response rates , survival and not compromise quality of life .
This is a large , appropriately powered study that primarily addressed response rates .  
The major problem with the study is the amount of cross over .  
More than half of the patients assigned to 5FU/leucovorin received further chemotherapy including irinotecan in many .  
Despite this , the results still clearly show  a significant improvement in response rates , duration of response , survival and quality of life in those who had irinotecan assigned initially .
