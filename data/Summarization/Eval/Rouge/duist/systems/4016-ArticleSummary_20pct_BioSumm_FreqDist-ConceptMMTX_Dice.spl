Survival is short and associated with weight  loss ,  onset or worsening of tumour-related symptoms ,  and poor quality of life .
Because cytotoxic agents have low response rates and can be associated with severe side-effects ,  many patients receive supportive care .
In first-line chemotherapy ,  fluorouracil with folinic-acid is  better than supportive care (or delayed chemotherapy) for survival and quality of life ,  but the value of second-line chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer has  not yet been proven .
Common side-effects included delayed diarrhoea ,  neutropenia , early cholinergic syndrome ,  nausea and  vomiting ,  alopecia , and asthenia .
Overall survival was the primary endpoint .
The secondary objectives were the impact of treatment on performance status ,  bodyweight , tumour-related symptoms ,  and quality of life .
To be eligible for randomisation ,  patients had to meet the following criteria ,  histologically proven metastatic colorectal cancer ,  progressive metastatic disease documented on the basis of either a 25% increase in the size of target lesions or an increase in carcinoembryonic antigen by 1.25 times an initial reference value and a baseline value of more than 10 ug/L ,   which allowed inclusion of patients with non-measurable  disease (peritoneal carcinomatosis and pelvic recurrences) ,   progression documented by two measurements not separated by  more than 6 months and tumour progression while on  fluorouracil or within 6 months of the last fluorouracil infusion ,  having had one adjuvant and/or no more than two palliative  fluorouracil-based regimens ,  age 18-75 years ,  WHO performance status 0.2 ,  neutrophils 2 10/L or more ,  platelets  100x10/L or more ,  total bilirubin 1.25 the institutional upper normal limit (IUNL) ,  or less ,  liver transaminases 3xIUNL (in  case of liver metastases ,  bilirubin <=1.5 IUNL and  transaminases <=5 IUNL) ,  or more ,  serum creatinine  135 umol/L or less ,  wash-out of 4 weeks for radiotherapy or  chemotherapy ,  and written informed consent .
Patients with the following criteria were not eligible ,  previous treatment with topoisomerase I inhibitors ,  bulky disease (involving more than 50% of the liver volume or 25% of the lung volume ,  or abdominal mass >=10 cm) ,  metastases in the  central nervous system ,  or unresolved bowel obstruction or diarrhoea .
In the irinotecan group ,  patients were given best supportive care and irinotecan 350 mg/m ,  diluted in 250 mL normal saline or dextrose ,  over a 90 min intravenous infusion every 3 weeks  (or 300 mg/m if aged >=70 years or WHO performance status 2 ,  according to previously recognised risk factors for developing  toxicity) .
In the supportive-care alone group ,  patients were given best supportive care and were seen every 3 weeks .
Supportive care included antibiotics ,   analgesics ,  transfusions ,  corticosteroids ,  or any other  symptomatic therapy (except iriontecan or other topoisomerase  I inhibitor) ,  and/or assistance of a psychotherapist .
Localised  radiation therapy to alleviate symptoms such as pain was  allowed provided that the total dose delivered was in the  palliative range according to institutional standards .
After discontinuation of treatment in the irinotecan group ,  patients were regularly assessed as in the supportive care group  (tumour status ,  symptoms ,  or side-effects ,  every 3 weeks) until  death or for at least a year .
Quality of life was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire (including five function scales ,  one global health-status scale ,  and nine symptom scales) ,  which was filled in at  baseline ,  at 3 weeks ,  6 weeks ,  and then every 6 weeks .
With p=0.05 and power of 0.80 ,  264 patients were  required (176 in the irinotecan group and 88 in the supportive-care group) to show a significant difference in 1-year survival from 20% (supportive care) to 35% (irinotecan) .
A retrospective stratification was planned to take into account the baseline prognostic factors (sex ,  age ,  performance status ,  weight loss ,  presence of liver metastases ,  site of primary tumour ,  number of  metastatic sites ,  response to and duration of fluorouracil treatment as well as its intent [adjuvant or palliative] ,   haemoglobin ,  white blood cells ,  platelets ,  lactate  dehydrogenase ,  transaminases ,  alkaline phosphatase ,  bilirubin ,  protein ,  and carcinoembryonic antigen) .
These characteristics were similar for both groups except for performance status (more patients having poor performance status in the supportive-care group were assessed by carcinoembryonic antigen only ,  with mean antigen ratios versus reference values of 2.24 and 2.83 ,  respectively .
Irinotecan was given for a median of 4.1  (0.7-12.6) months and 172 (91%) patients received their  first infusion within 8 days of randomisation. 40 (21%)  patients in the irinotecan group received subsequent  anticancer chemotherapies (31 a fluorouracil regimen ,   nine a drug other than irinotecan) .
In the supportive- care group 28 (31%) of patients received chemotherapy (21 a fluorouracil regimen ,  nine other drugs ,  and one irinotecan). 17 (19%) patients in the supportive-care  group received chemotherapy within 1 month  of randomisation compared with two (1%) in the  irinotecan group .
This benefit appeared after 2 months and became more apparent throughout the study period.  1-year survival was 36.2% and 13.8% in the irinotecan and supportive-care groups ,  respectively .
Pain-free survival in patients without pain at baseline (figure 4) was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the supportive-care group (p=0.003) ,  despite a higher proportion of patients on opioids in the supportive-care group .
The univariate analyses of variance were significantly in favour of the irinotecan group for the cognitive functioning score (p.0.001) ,  the global quality-of-life  score (p<0.001) ,  the pain score (p=0.008) ,  dyspnoea  (p=0.04) ,  appetite loss (p<0.002) ,  and financial-impact scores (p<0.001) .
Analyses on worst patient score during the study are shown in  table 3 ,  all results were significantly in favour of irinotecan except for emotional ,  nausea ,  sleep  disturbance ,  and financial scores .
Patients on supportive-care alone experienced a high incidence of severe adverse events ,  especially pain and asthenia ,  although significantly more patients in the irinotecan group experienced severe events ,  especially neutropenia ,  nausea ,  vomiting ,  and diarrhoea .
Other efficacy endpoints ,  such as survival without weight loss ,  survival  without performance status deterioration ,  pain-free survival ,  and quality-of-life ,  were all significantly in  favour of irinotecan .
The survival advantage for the irinotecan group remained highly significant after adjustment of performance status ,  a well-recognised prognostic  factor .
The results were consistent with other clinical variables (performance status deterioration ,  weight loss , and pain control) .
