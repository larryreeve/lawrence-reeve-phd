Loco-regional and distant relapses contribute to impair theoutcome of rectal cancer patients) As to the former ,  eitherpre- or post-operative radiation therapy (RT) significantlyreduce loco-regional recurrence ,  post-operative chemotherapy(CT) ,  alone or in different combinations with RT , is effective in improving both disease-free survival andsurvival .
The aim of this trial is to assess the effectiveness and toxicityof adjuvant post-operative RT vs combined RT and CT(5-FU plus levamisole) in patients with TNM stage II-IIIresectable rectal cancer (pT3-4 ,  pN0 ,  M0 ,  pTl-4 ,  pNl-3 , M0) .
Eligible patients are enrolled within 40 days after surgery in a multicentre randomized clinical trial with two arms ,  Arm I = post-operative RT ,  Arm II = post-operative RT and CT (5-FU plus levamisole) ,  with stratification by participating institutions .
Within 42 days from surgery ,  patients randomized in Arm I receive RT (50 Gy) in daily fractions of 2 Gy ,  5 days/wk for 5 wk ,  to tumour bed and loco-regional lymph-nodes (internal iliac and presacral nodes) with four portals (LL and AP) .
The median randomization time occurred on the 19th post-operative day (range ,  6-24 days) ,  on average ,  patients began RT 43 days from surgery (range ,  27-98 days) .
As regards toxicity ,  radiodermatitis (8.3% ,  Grade III) and diarrhoea (8.3% ,  Grade III) were observed in Arm I while radiodermatitis (13.6% ,  Grade III) ,  diarrhoea (27.3% ,  Grade III ,  9.1% ,  Grade IV) ,  and leukopaenia (8.3% ,  Grade III) occurred in Arm II .
