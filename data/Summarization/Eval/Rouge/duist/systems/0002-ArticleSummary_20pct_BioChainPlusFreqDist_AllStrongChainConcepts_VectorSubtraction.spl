CERVICAL cancer is the second most frequent cancer among women worldwide and the most frequent cancer among women in Africa ,  Asia ,  and South America .
As a result ,  about 25 percent of patients with cervical cancer in the United States present with locally advanced disease (stage IIB through IVA according to the staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) .
Radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea has been compared in separate trials with radiotherapy alone ,  with radiotherapy and concomitant therapy with misonidazole ,  and with radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil (and Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) .
METHODS .
Radiotherapy .
Interstitial and high-dose brachytherapy were not allowed .
The length of delays in radiotherapy ,  in days ,  was calculated by subtracting the planned duration of radiotherapy (the number of prescribed fractions plus 2 weekend days for every five fractions plus 10 days for each implant) from the actual duration of radiotherapy .
The Radiological Physics Center in Houston reviewed all technical aspects of radiotherapy and verified the calibration of the instruments used .
Treatment with cisplatin was discontinued if the leukocyte count dropped below 2500 per cubic millimeter or the platelet count dropped below 50,000 per cubic millimeter ,  and it was resumed once the counts rose above these levels .
Randomization was carried out by a block arrangement ,  the treatment assignments were stratified according to center and the three clinical stages of disease ,  with approximately equal numbers assigned to each treatment group .
Life-table estimates were calculated according to the method of Kaplan and Meier ,  and differences in progression-free survival were evaluated with use of the log-rank test according to the intention-to-treat principle .
Pearson's chi-square test was used to detect differences in the incidence of adverse effects among treatment regimens .
Because of this negligible increase and to simplify the presentation ,  the P values were not adjusted for the results of the interim analyses .
Progression-free Survival .
Survival .
The median duration of follow-up was 35 months .
As of this writing ,  75 percent of the patients have either died or have been followed for 30 months .
Survival rates were also significantly better in these two groups (P=0.004 and P=0.002 ,  respectively) than in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy (Fig. 2) .
Table 3 shows the number of cycles of chemotherapy (i.e. ,  weeks) administered in each group .
Radiotherapy .
There were no treatment-related deaths .
The types and frequencies of adverse effects are shown in Table 4 .
DISCUSSION .
Despite improvements in radiation equipment and techniques ,  in approximately two thirds of the cases ,  progression occurs within the area that was irradiated .
In a study of 19 human cervical-cancer cell lines ,  Britten et al. found that radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin increased the rates of death of these tumor cells .
Many combinations of cisplatin have been studied in phase 2 trials of patients with cervical cancer .
They found a high rate of response ,  but 28 percent of their patients had severe late gastrointestinal complications .
In our study ,  the duration of radiotherapy and the dose of radiation were similar among the three regimens , implying that the differences in progression-free survival and survival were related to the chemotherapy .
Treatment with cisplatin alone was less toxic than treatment with the three-drug regimen .
