Since the 5-year analysis was criticized because of the wide range (2.7 to 7.5 years) of follow-up time ,  we performed a 7-year analysis with only four of 189 patients monitored for less than 5 years .
Patients and Methods ,  A total of 189 patients with resected Dukes' C colorectal cancer were randomly allocated to infusions of a total of 900 mg 17-1A antibody ,  500 mg postoperatively followed by 4 monthly doses of 100 mg (n = 99) ,  or to observation only (n = 90) .
After 7 years of follow-up evaluation ,  treatment had reduced overall mortality by 32% (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P < .01 ,  log-rank ,  P = .01) and decreased the recurrence rate by 23% (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P < .04 ,  log-rank ,  P = .07) .
The intentionto-treat analysis gave a significant effect for overall survival (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P < .01 ,  log-rank ,  P = .02) and disease-free survival (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P = .02 ,  log-rank ,  P = .1 1) .
While distant metastases were significantly reduced (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P = .004 ,  log-rank ,  P = .004) ,  local relapses were not (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P = .65 ,  log-rank ,  P = .52) .
In contrast to other trials aimed at patients with larger metastatic tumor masses and using regression or shrinkage as the end point ,  this one on colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C required microscopically complete resection of the primary tumor for patients to be admitted.3 As the primary end point ,  overall-survival was determined at 5 years .
Here ,  we report on the 7-year follow-up study of this prospective randomized two-arm trial in minimal residual disease that used the murine 17-1A antibody ,  4 which recognizes a 34-kd glycoprotein of the cell membrane of epithelial cells.5 The 5-year analysis had shown that a short ,  albeit intensive ,  postoperative course of antibody treatment (900 mg total dose) significantly reduced the appearance of distant metastases ,  but did not affect the rate of local relapses .
Now ,  after a median observation time of 7 years ,  with only four of 185 patients monitored for less than 5 years ,  the study has matured and continues to demonstrate a significant benefit with regard to survival .
The multicenter study consisted of six academic centers in former West Germany A total of 189 patients were randomized ,  with the first patient entered in May 1985 and the last in Apnl 1990 The study was closed in December 1992 ,  and we present here the final status with median follow-up data of 7 years Eligible patients were required to have histologically confirmed adenocarcmoma of colon or the rectum with spread to regional lymph nodes (Dukes' C or International Unimon Agamst Cancer [UICC] stage III) In addition ,  hlstopathologic confirmation of curative resection (R0) was secured Radical tumor resection was performed by a standardized technique agreed upon by all participating centers When located within 15 cm of the anal verge ,  a tumor was classified as rectal carcinoma Patients were less than 70 years old and had a Karnofsky index greater than 50% Eleven of 99 patients randomized to treatment refused their treatment assignment ,  but were otherwise considered eligible for the study .
All patients were stratified according to Zelen 8 by the following factors participating center ,  sex ,  location of tumor ,  stage (Dukes' Cl or C2 equivalent to pN1 or pN2-3) ,  number of affected lymph nodes ,  and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level before surgery (Table 1) In the treated arm ,  more patients had pT2 and pT3 tumors ,  and fewer had pT4 tumors However ,  treated patients appeared to have had higher numbers of involved lymph nodes (pN2) and tumors of less differentiated histology (grade 3) .
However ,  a Fishers' exact test ,  companng the distnbutlon of patients according to all prognostic variables ,  showed no significant differences Randomlzation before consent was performed and evaluated according to Zelen 9 On approval by legal experts in 1985 ,  this procedure was accepted by the ethical review board Statistical analyses were performed according to SAS (Statistical Analysis System ,  Cary ,  NC) To test for potential selection bias in the study ,  a retrospective analysis was performed at Medizimnische Hochschule Hannover on 67 Dukes' C colorectal cancer patients selected from 107 patients seen between 1980 and 1985 They fulfilled the entry criteria for the 17-1A clinical trial and were monitored for at least 5 years each The survival analysis was performed by the Instutut fur Medlzinische Informatlk und Blomathematlk ,  Umversltat Essen The overall survival according to Kaplan-Meier curve is nearly identical to the control group of the 17-1A trial (log-rank ,  P = 97) ,  thus ,  this historical control does not show any selection bias .
Some patients have now been monitored for 10 years and only five patients were observed for a period of less than 5 years ,  with a range of 3.5 to 4.5 years .
Thus ,  eight patients had Dukes' B ,  four had Dukes' D ,  three were older than 70 years ,  one presented with polyposis coh ,  and one patient had residual tumor (R2) after surgery .
The KaplanMeier survival curves (Fig 1A) showed a significant benefit for patients who received antibody over those who did not receive treatment (P < .01 with Cox's proportional hazard model corrected for influence of prognostic variables ,  and P = .01 with log-rank test for the univariate analysis) .
Also ,  the intention-to-treat analysis (Fig B) on all 185 patients showed a significant overall benefit for the treated group (P < .01 with Cox's multivariate analysis ,  and P = .02 with log-rank test for the univanate analysis) .
Among all deaths recorded ,  six patients died without recurrence or secondary colorectal cancer and one observed patient of the control group died of secondary colon carcinoma ,  which was not counted as a recurrence .
When cancer-related mortality was assessed ,  ie ,  death without recurrence was not counted as event ,  the benefit of treatment remained significant at P < .01 by Cox's multivariate analysis and P = .01 by log-rank test for the univariate analysis .
The median survival time before death after recurrence was 1.4 years for patients randomized to treatment with 17-1A and 1.2 years for patients in the observed group .
According to the disease-free interval analysis ,  tumor recurred in 96 of 166 eligible patients after 7 years of follow-up evaluation ,  thus ,  three more recurrences were recorded m the treatment group and one more in the observation arm .
Antibody treatment increased time to recurrence (P = .04 with Cox proportional hazards model corrected for influence of prognostic variables ,  and P = .07 with log-rank test for umvanate analysis) .
However ,  when death without recurrence was considered an event (recurrence-free survival) ,  again a significant treatment advantage with 17-1A over control was obtained (P = .03 with Cox multivariate ,  and P = .05 with log-rank test for the umvariate analysis) .
When the analyses of recurrence-free interval and recurrence-free survival were performed including all randomized patients ,  ie ,  according to intention-to-treat ,  17-1A treatment again led to significant advantage over the untreated group (Cox multivanate ,  P = .02 ,  log-rank ,  P = .01 ,  respectively) .
In summary ,  46% of patients (41 of 90) in the treatment group are at nsk at 7 years and only 29% of patients (22 of 76) m the observed group are alive without recurrence .
When the two groups were compared with regard to the site of first recurrence ,  the 7-year data similar to the 5-year analysis show that significantly fewer distant recurrences occur in patients treated with the antibody than in the control arm (Fig 3) .
However ,  local relapses that occurred as the first sign of progressive disease (Fig 4) were not reduced (P = .86 with Cox multivanate analysis) .
When tested for antibody response against murine antibody (HAMA) ,  80% of treated patients developed a distinct HAMA response after the second or third nfusion .
As will be reported elsewhere ,  the serum levels of antiidlotyplc antibodies (Ab2) showed no significant differences between the analyzed patients who remained tumor free (n = 30) or experienced a relapse (n = 30) .
Patients in the control group continued to die of progressive disease that probably had arisen from occult distant metastatic cells that were elimnated by the antibody in the treatment group .
Interestingly ,  in the most recent report (median follow-up time ,  6.5 years) ,  adjuvant therapy with fluorouracil plus levamisol administered to patients with Dukes' C colon cancer had only a minimal effect on local recurrences .
In that trial ,  only colon cancer patients were treated who were known to have fewer local relapses than rectum cancer patients and were included in our trial .
Why only one third of the patients at risk have responded to the antibody treatment may be explained by variations in accessibility ,  vulnerability ,  and/or antigen expression in individual disseminated tumor cells .
