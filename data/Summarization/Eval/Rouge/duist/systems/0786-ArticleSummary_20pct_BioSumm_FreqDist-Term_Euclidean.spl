RECURRENCE OF rectal cancer in the pelvis after a complete resection represents a major contributor to morbidity and subsequent mortality .
An escalating single-agent 5-FU regimen incorporating a theoretical maximum-tolerated dose was chosen as the alternative treatment option based on clinical evidence suggesting a dose response curve for 5-FU and pilot data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggesting added efficacy of 5-FU when given at higher dose levels .
Eligibility and Exclusion Criteria .
Randomization .
Chemotherapy .
Courses were to be repeated at 10-week intervals for a totalof 18 months of treatment .
Escalating 5-FU .
Courses were to be repeated at 4-week intervals for a total of six courses of postradiotherapy treatment .
This dose was not to be exceeded for the fifth and sixth courses .
Dose Reduction Criteria .
Thomas.Deviations in dose and fractionation of up to 5% were considered satisfactory for protocol compliance .
Deviations greater than 5% but <= 10% were considered minor deviations ,  and deviations greater than 10% were regarded as major deviations .
Variations of field placement were also categorized into minor and major clinicaldeviations .
Patient Follow-Up .
Evaluations were to consist of pertinent medical history ,  physical examinations ,  peripheral hemogram ,  blood chemistries ,  and chest x-rays at 6 ,  12 ,  and 18 months ,  and then annually .
Verification that these criteria were followed is unavailable .
Criteria for Recurrence .
Perineal pain ,  if preceded by a pain-free interval ,  was considered indicative of recurrence ,  and time of recurrence was listed as the time of pain onset .
Only the first site of recurrence was reported .
Statistical Considerations .
Probability distribution estimates of survival and disease-free survival were performed using the product-limit method of Kaplanand Meier .
RESULTS .
Patient Cohort .
Patient Characteristics .
None of these differences were statistically significant .
Dosimetry deviations were limited to 5% of the cases .
Toxicity .
At the time of death the patient's leukocyte count was below 500/UL .
No episodes of acute myeloid leukemia have been reported on either arm of the study .
Disease Recurrence .
The probability of 3-year disease-free survival on the two arms is 54% and 68% for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and the escalating 5-FU arm ,  respectively ,  median time to recurrenceis estimated to be 4 years and greater than 4 years ,  respectively (Fig 1) .
Mortality .
There is no difference between the two arms with respect to the survival distributions (P = .58 ,  two-tailed) .
DISCUSSION .
As expected ,  myelosuppression was the most common toxicity seen in both arms .
The risk to the patient ,  however ,  is balanced by the expected survival benefit .
The protocol-mandated radiotherapy dose (4140 cGy) may be suboptimal .
