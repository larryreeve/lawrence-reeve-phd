SINCE JUNE 1973 ,  the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of CMF (cyclophosphamide ,  methotrexate ,  and fluorouracil) chemotherapy were evaluated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes .
After radical mastectomy ,  eligible patients were prospectively randomized to receive either no further treatment or 12 monthly cycles of adjuvant CMF .
Within 4 wk from surgery ,  patients with TI-3a breast cancer ,  histologically positive axillary nodes ,  age < 70 yr ,  and living fairly close to the Institute were allocated to receive either 12 or 6 cycles of CMF .
Based on the 3-yr analysis of our first CMF study showing an apparent lack of therapeutic advantage following adjuvant chemotherapy in postmenopausal women ,  randomization for this group of patients was discontinued at the end of November 1976 .
Therefore ,  all postmenopausal patients were allocated to receive 12 CMF cycles between December 1976 and March 1977 when accrual for postmenopausal patients was definitely discontinued .
A total of 18 patients older than 65 yr (CMF 12: 12 ,  CMF 6: 6) were started on low-dose CMF (MTX 30 mg/sq m ,  FU 400 mg/sq m) .
During treatment ,  a dose reduction schedule was applied to all patients showing myelosuppression on days 1 and 8 of each treatment cycle .
The following systemic treatment was mainly utilized: patients in whom estrogen receptors were positive were subjected to hormonal manipulations (ovariectomy in premenopausal women and additive hormonal therapy ,  particularly tamoxifen ,  in postmenopausal patients) ,  combined sometimes with chemotherapy .
Therefore ,  a total of 459 patients were found evaluable for treatment comparison ,  i.e. ,  243 women (premenopausal 160 ,  postmenopausal 83) allocated in the 12-cycle group and 216 (premenopausal 164 ,  postmenopausal 52) in the 6-cycle group ,  respectively .
Furthermore ,  in 5 additional patients ,  CMF was temporarily discontinued at some time during treatment (for 2-3 mo) because women complained of constant nausea due to oral cyclophosphamide .
In postmenopausal women with more than 3 nodes ,  the difference between CMF 12 (34.4%) and CMF 6 (54.9% ,  p = 0.18) is only apparent since the confidence-limits throughout the curve totally blurred the percent difference (standard error ,  or SE ,  at 5 yr: 8.4 and 11.3 ,  respectively) .
It is important to emphasize that overall no RFS difference was documented between preand postmenopausal patients (CMF 12: 59.3% versus 57.6%; In fact ,  premenopausal patients in the 12-cycle group had a 72% 5-yr survival compared to 77.1% for women in the 6-cycle group (p = 0.20) .
As can be seen ,  RFS was superior in patients with ER + tumors ,  but this difference failed to reach statistical significance in all patient subsets .
Only a small subgroup of 22 patients (4.8%) refused to complete the planned program ,  and this was essentially due to negative psychologic reasons since these patients objected to being on a heavy and toxic treatment program (drug injections and timing of follow-up) without having visible disease .
As already reported (Table 2) ,  contralateral breast cancer was documented in a total of 11 patients (CMF 12: 6; 3 patients in the 12-cycle group developed endometrial carcinoma ,  thyroid cancer ,  and myoblastoma ,  respectively ,  and in all patients second neoplasms were diagnosed between 46 and 49 mo from mastectomy .
The observation that in some patient subsets 6 cycles of CMF yielded apparently superior results to 12 cycles is probably related to the relative number of patients in each group and to the different median follow-up in postmenopausal women  whose accrual was discontinued in December 1976 .
The first and most important one is that there appears to be no real difference following adjuvant chemotherapy ,  namely CMF ,  between the RFS of pre- versus postmenopausal women (CMF 12: 59.3% versus 57.6%; The findings supporting evidence of a therapeutic efficacy of adjuvant combination chemotherapy in postmenopausal patients can also be found in the results reported by other investigators who have never observed that menopausal status affected treatment outcome .
More recently ,  the Guy's Hospital and Manchester study groups reported the actuarial 5-yr RFS of a randomized study comparing radical mastectomy alone versus melphalan versus CMF and showed that the only group significantly improved by adjuvant CMF was that of postmenopausal women ,  while premenopausal patients had findings that were superimposable in all three treatment groups .
Patterns of first treatment failure were not different in the two series and ,  regardless of treatment instituted upon relapse ,  frequency of objective remissions were similar between the two groups followed by short-lived remissions in ER - tumors ,  while ER + tumors tended to show slow growing disease .
Based on our current findings ,  i.e. ,  therapeutic efficacy of adjuvant CMF regardless of ER status ,  there seems to be no clinical reason to withhold the administration of adjuvant combination chemotherapy in node positive women even in the presence of ER + tumors .
Through the analysis of our results in advanced breast cancer treated with CMF ,  Skipper came to the conclusion that in clinically metastatic disease the nadir in surviving tumor cells is probably reached in the majority of patients in less than 6 cycles .
In fact ,  although both frequency and intensity of acute toxicity from adjuvant therapy such as CMF are moderate ,  patients can be spared unnecessary side effects ,  including negative psychologic reactions ,  if treatment duration is rendered more tolerable .
