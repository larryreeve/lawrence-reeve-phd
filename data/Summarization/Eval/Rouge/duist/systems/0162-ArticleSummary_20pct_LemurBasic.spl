since june 1973 the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of cmf cyclophosphamide methotrexate and fluorouracil chemotherapy were evaluated at the istituto nazionale tumori of milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes 
the 7 yr results of this first program are now available 6 and they confirm the benefit of cmftreated patients rfs 49 2 as compared to women subjected to radical mastectomy alone rfs 35 8 p 0 002 
these results as well as those reported in similar studies suggest that the multimodality approach with cyclical combination chemotherapy is indeed an important advance in the strategy of primary management of resectable breast cancer and therefore it is worthy of more widespread consideration 
within 4 wk from surgery patients with ti 3a breast cancer histologically positive axillary nodes age 70 yr and living fairly close to the institute were allocated to receive either 12 or 6 cycles of cmf 
based on the 3 yr analysis of our first cmf study showing an apparent lack of therapeutic advantage following adjuvant chemotherapy in postmenopausal women randomization for this group of patients was discontinued at the end of november 1976 
the dose schedule of cmf was as follows cyclophosphamide ctx 100 mg sq m by mouth from day 1 to day 14 methotrexate mtx 40 mg sq m intravenously on days 1 and 8 and fluorouracil fu 600 mg sq m intravenously on days 1 and 8 
the dose of all three drugs was reduced by 50 when the leukocyte count ranged from 3900 to 2500 cu mm or the platelet count from 99 000 to 75 000 cu mm in the presence of more severe myelosuppression treatment was delayed until at least half of the dose could be administered 
the following systemic treatment was mainly utilized patients in whom estrogen receptors were positive were subjected to hormonal manipulations ovariectomy in premenopausal women and additive hormonal therapy particularly tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients combined sometimes with chemotherapy 
in fact the retrospective evaluation of roentgenograms revealed the presence of distant metastases prior to radical mastectomy in 3 patients cmf 12 1 cmf 6 2 while 4 additional women cmf 12 3 cmf 6 1 had fixation of the primary tumor to the underlying pectoral fascia or muscle t3b 
therefore a total of 459 patients were found evaluable for treatment comparison i e 243 women premenopausal 160 postmenopausal 83 allocated in the 12 cycle group and 216 premenopausal 164 postmenopausal 52 in the 6 cycle group respectively 
in postmenopausal women with more than 3 nodes the difference between cmf 12 34 4 and cmf 6 54 9 p 0 18 is only apparent since the confidence limits throughout the curve totally blurred the percent difference standard error or se at 5 yr 8 4 and 11 3 respectively 
the somewhat contrasting results observed in the 6 cycle group in pre and postmenopausal patients with 1 3 nodes 80 3 versus 66 1 again reflect only a fictitious difference se 4 1 and 8 1 respectively 
however in spite of the fact that frequency of objective remission was superimposable 30 in both er groups regardless of treatment administered and site s of first involvement the disease in er tumors had amore indolent course while er tumors showed further progression within a few months 
table 4 shows that also in this series there was evidence of a dose response effect regardless of menopausal and nodal status cmf 12 level i 68 9 versus level 11147 2 p 0 05 cmf 6 level i 66 6 versus level iii 51 5 p 0 10 
myelosuppression represented the dose limiting factor in the large majority of patients 70 80 but severe leukopenia and or thrombocytopenia were rare 10 and prolonged myelosuppression beyond the fourth week from drug discontinuation was never observed 
only a small subgroup of 22 patients 4 8 refused to complete the planned program and this was essentially due to negative psychologic reasons since these patients objected to being on a heavy and toxic treatment program drug injections and timing of follow up without having visible disease 
in one patient of the 6 cycle group endometrial carcinoma in situ was documented within 16 mo from mastectomy 3 patients in the 12 cycle group developed endometrial carcinoma thyroid cancer and myoblastoma respectively and in all patients second neoplasms were diagnosed between 46 and 49 mo from mastectomy 
the observation that in some patient subsets 6 cycles of cmf yielded apparently superior results to 12 cycles is probably related to the relative number of patients in each group and to the different median follow up in postmenopausal women whose accrual was discontinued in december 1976 
thus all above reported findings strongly support our preliminary 3 yr results and indicate that utilizing a single multidrug regimen it is possible to reduce the duration of adjuvant treatment in operable breast cancer without compromising the therapeutic results 
in this trial patients with 4 positive axillary nodes or with a positive node in the highest axillary zone were randomized to receive cyclophosphamide and adriamycin for 5 courses 15 wk or the same regimen given for 10 courses 30 wk 
it appears evident that a the two series given 12 cycles of cmf achieved the same results b the data reported in the three series treated with cmf are almost equivalent c adjuvant cmf whether administered for 12 or 6 cycles was able to alter the course of operable breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes compared to the group subjected to radical mastectomy alone 
the first and most important one is that there appears to be no real difference following adjuvant chemotherapy namely cmf between the rfs of pre versus postmenopausal women cmf 12 59 3 versus 57 6 cmf 6 66 5 versus 63 1 respectively 
more recently the guy s hospital and manchester study groups reported the actuarial 5 yr rfs of a randomized study comparing radical mastectomy alone versus melphalan versus cmf and showed that the only group significantly improved by adjuvant cmf was that of postmenopausal women while premenopausal patients had findings that were superimposable in all three treatment groups 
the results obtained in our series between er and er tumors coupled with the overall findings observed in the two menopausal groups further contribute to minimize the possible therapeutic role of chemotherapy induced adjuvant castration in premenopausal women 
patterns of first treatment failure were not different in the two series and regardless of treatment instituted upon relapse frequency of objective remissions were similar between the two groups followed by short lived remissions in er tumors while er tumors tended to show slow growing disease 
based on our current findings i e therapeutic efficacy of adjuvant cmf regardless of er status there seems to be no clinical reason to withhold the administration of adjuvant combination chemotherapy in node positive women even in the presence of er tumors 
through the analysis of our results in advanced breast cancer treated with cmf skipper came to the conclusion that in clinically metastatic disease the nadir in surviving tumor cells is probably reached in the majority of patients in less than 6 cycles 
in fact although both frequency and intensity of acute toxicity from adjuvant therapy such as cmf are moderate patients can be spared unnecessary side effects including negative psychologic reactions if treatment duration is rendered more tolerable 
the reason s why rfs was not improved by prolonging chemotherapy once pathologic complete remission has been achieved in our own trial and in other adjuvant trials for breast cancer as well as in a variety of neoplastic diseases can now be interpreted by considering the problem of specifically multidrug resistant phenotypes 
the 40 yr old mutation theory of luria and delbruck developed for bacterial cells was recently adapted to cancer i e neoplastic cells mutate spontaneously to a state of specific resistance to a wide variety of anticancer drugs 
in our optimal kinetic situation cyclic or sequential delivery of equally effective and non cross resistant drugs often will prevent or delay failures due to overgrowth of drug resistant sublines of neoplastic cells as recently demonstrated in advanced hodgkin s disease 
since our current results with adjuvant cmf are comparable to those utilizing a 5 drug combination or an adriamycin containing regimen clinical research efforts should now aim at improving the intrinsic limitation of a single multidrug regimen 
furthermore to insure full drug doses in the new protocols we have modified the cmf regimen and all three drugs are administered intravenously every 3 wk ctx and fu 600 mg sq m mtx 40 mg sq m 
only long term analysis will answer the questions of whether the addition of adjuvant hormone therapy to chemotherapy will improve the results in er tumors and whether the excellent results reported by the m d anderson hospital with fac fluorouracil adriamycin cyclophosphamide in women with 4 axillary nodes 7 will be reproducible 
at present tumor cell burden in the axilla appears to consistently represent an important prognostic factor even in the presence of full dose chemotherapy while new prospective trials should explore the potential efficacy of multiple non cross resistant drug combinations delivered for a relatively short time
