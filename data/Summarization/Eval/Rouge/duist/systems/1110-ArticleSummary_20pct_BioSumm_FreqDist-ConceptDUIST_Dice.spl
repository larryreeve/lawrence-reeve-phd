In the United States ,  cervical cancer disproportionately affects women who are members of minority groups and women of low socioeconomic status ,  partly because such women tend to have insufficient access to and knowledge of screening programs for cervical cancer .
In 1990 ,  the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) began a randomized clinical trial to compare the effects on survival of treatment with extended-field radiation and treatment with pelvic radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in patients with cervical cancer .
We enrolled women of all ages who had stages IIB through IVA squamous-cell carcinoma ,  adenocarcinoma ,  or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix according to the staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (Table 1) or stage IB or IIA of one of these cancers with a tumor diameter of at least 5 cm or biopsy-proved metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes .
Women with a Karnofsky performance score of at least 60 and blood counts and serum levels of blood urea nitrogen ,  creatinine ,  and bilirubin that were within normal ranges were eligible for the study .
Women were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria ,  disease outside the pelvic area or spread to para-aortic lymph nodes ,  a prior cancer other than cutaneous basal-cell carcinoma ,  medical contraindications to chemotherapy ,  a rare histologic subtype ,  and prior hysterectomy or transperitoneal staging procedure for cervical cancer ,  pelvic radiotherapy ,  or systemic chemotherapy .
Patients who completed the pretreatment evaluation and met all eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to receive extended field radiotherapy or radiotherapy to the pelvic region with concurrent treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil .
External-beam radiation was delivered with anteroposterior and posteroanterior opposed beams of at least 15-MV photons or the use of four fields (anteroposterior ,  posteroanterior ,  and two lateral fields) of at least 4-MV photons .
For patients who were assigned to receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy ,  the treatment field extended from the space between L4 and L5 to the midpubis or to a line 4 cm below the most distal vaginal or cervical site of disease .
Custom shielding was designed to treat the pelvic lymph nodes ,  with a margin of at least 1 to 1.5 cm. For patients who were assigned to receive radiotherapy alone ,  the pelvic and paraaortic areas were treated as a continuous area ,  with a superiorfield border at the space between L1 and L2 .
The suggested maximal doses to the bladder ,  the rectum ,  and the lateral surface of the vagina were 75 ,  70 ,  and 130 Gy ,  respectively .
To avoid treatment delays ,  intracavitary insertions were performed without chemotherapy if a patient had a granulocyte count of less than 1500 per cubic millimeter and a platelet count of less than 100,000 per cubic millimeter .
Before each cycle of chemotherapy ,  serum levels of creatinine ,  urea nitrogen ,  alanine aminotransferase ,  alkaline phosphatase ,  and bilirubin were measured .
Once treatment ended ,  patients were evaluated every three months for the first two years ,  every four months during the third year ,  every six months during the fourth and fifth years ,  and then annually .
Disease status and the degree of treatment-related toxic effects were assessed by history taking ,  physical examination ,  and appropriate laboratory and radiologic tests .
Radiotherapy records ,  including data concerning external-beam fields ,  intracavitary placement ,  doses of radiation to tumor and normal tissues ,  and other treatment variables ,  were reviewed by a radiation oncologist .
Disease- free survival was also compared in the two groups and was calculated from the date of study entry to the date of the first occurrence of disease progression ,  a second diagnosis of cancer ,  or death from any cause ,  or if none of these events occurred ,  to the date of the last follow-up visit .
Five-year rates of secondary end points such as locoregional recurrence ,  para-aortic recurrence ,  and distant metastasis were estimated with the use of cumulative-incidence methods , and treatment effects were tested with use of the Gray algorithm .
The nominal significance level required for early reporting was origioriginally set at P=0.005 ,  but we subsequently adopted a more conservative approach ,  because it allowed the number of deaths observed to determine the nominal level required for early reporting .
Fifteen patients (4 percent) — six in the combined-therapy group and nine in the radiotherapy group — were subsequently disqualified because of failure to undergo the required evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (eight patients) ,  the presence of extrapelvic cancer (two) ,  the presence of a rare histologic subtype (one) ,  the presence of a stage IB1 tumor with no involvement of pelvic nodes (one) ,  the absence of pretreatment data (two) ,  and receipt of chemotherapy before radiotherapy (one) .
Eleven patients (3 percent) did not undergo brachytherapy ,  three patients refused ,  and eight patients did not undergo it for other reasons .
Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that overall survival rates were significantly better among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy than among those treated with radiotherapy alone (73 percent vs. 58 percent ,  P=0.004) (Table 5 and Fig. 1) .
We found that the combination of pelvic radiation and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil was more effective for locally advanced cervical cancer than pelvic and para-aortic radiation alone .
Although chemotherapy  increased the hematologic toxicity ,  this effect was reversible and the incidence of late side effects was similar in the two treatment groups .
The Gynecologic Oncology Group has also studied the effect of radiotherapy in combination with either hydroxyurea or placebo in women with stage IIIB or IVA disease .
Although the group reported significant improvements in overall and disease-free survival with the addition of hydroxyurea therapy ,  the study has been criticized for the use of a low dose of radiation and the poor survival rates in both groups and because more than half of the 190 patients who were enrolled could not be evaluated .
Despite these criticisms ,  the resultsof that study and those of trials assessing concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy for other tumors stimulated studies of the effects of radiotherapy and various combinations of fluorouracil ,  cisplatin ,  mitomycin ,  carboplatin ,  and paclitaxel as treatments for locally advanced cervical cancer.The results of these trials have been encouraging ,  but mostclinicians have not found them sufficiently  convincing to justify the inclusion of chemotherapy in the routine treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer .
Reports by Rose et al. and Keys et al. in this issue of the Journal strengthen the body of evidence supporting the use of combined therapy in women with advanced cervical cancer .
Future studies will continue to evaluate cisplatin and fluorouracil as well as other drugs to determine the most effective doses and routes of administration .
We believe there is now sufficient evidence to recommend that women with locally advanced cervical cancer confined to the pelvis receive pelvic radiation concomitantly with treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil .
