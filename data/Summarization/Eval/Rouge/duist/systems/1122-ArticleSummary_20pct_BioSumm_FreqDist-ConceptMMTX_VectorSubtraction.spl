The preferred treatment of women with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO IA2–IIA) is radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy .
The overall prognosis for patients undergoing radical hysterectomy is good ,  with reported 5-year survival rates ranging from 75 to 90% .
The clinicopathologic factors which predict a poorer prognosis for patients with an early carcinoma of the cervix have been well established .
These factors have been shown to be associated with a high risk of recurrence in other studies ,  both from single institutions and from cooperative groups .
Data forms were maintained in a central location ,  also at MSKCC .
At the completion of treatment ,  patients were followed according to the individual surgeons’ preference .
The trial was closed to patient entry in June 1994 due to less than optimal accrual .
RESULTS .
All had 1 risk factor .
Five of 12 chemotherapy alone .
There skin reaction .
DISCUSSION .
Patterns for an early-stage cervical cancer has generally focused on of recurrence did not appear to be significantly different ,  as whether radiation therapy alone is beneficial in reducing presented in Table 2. recurrence rates .
Radiation therapy alone probably reduces .
The rate or recurrences among all the patients in the trial  validates the selection of the entry criteria as high-risk factors .
Twelve of the 19 recurrences were either local recurrences only or local plus distant metastases ,  with no difference in the number of local occurrences between the two treatment arms .
