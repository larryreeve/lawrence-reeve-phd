Cisplatin is said to be the most active anticancer drug in cervical cancer ,  although 100 mg/m did not significantly improve the complete response (CR) rate compared prospectively with 50 mg/m (12.7 v 10% ,  respectively) and there was no appreciable difference in response duration ,  progression-free interval (PFI) ,  or survival.Thus ,  there is no convincing reason to use a cisplatindose higher than 50 mg/m .
A phase II study of the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) demonstrated activity formitolactol as a single agent in cervical cancer using 180mg/m/d for 10 days by mouth in repeated 4-week cycles.There were 55 assessable patients ,  with one CR and 15 partial responses (PRs) (29% response rate) .
A pilot study used mitolactol plus cisplatin and established a tolerable dose schedule of 180 mg/m of mitolactoldaily for 5 days with cisplatin 50 mg/m .
Ifosfamide is a new agent closely related to cyclophosphamide ,  but with less marrow toxicity and more bladder toxicity that requires concomitant use of the uroprotectormesna .
If a measurable lesion monitored by CT scan was less than 3 cm , it must have been confirmed by biopsy or cytology .
However ,  shortly after activation ,  the study was amended so that the serum creatinine concentration was to be within the institution's normal limits and the serum albumin level was to be >= 3 g/dL .
Ineligible patients included those with cervical neoplasms other than squamous cell carcinoma or with nonmeasurable cervical cancer ,  WBC count less than 4,000/uL and/or platelet count less than 100,000/uL ,  abnormal liver function (bilirubin ,  AST ,  or alkaline phosphatase level > two times normal not related to the cancer) , bilateral hydronephrosis ,  GOG PS 3 or 4 ,  past or concomitant malignancy other than skin (excluding melanoma) ,  prior therapy with cytotoxic drugs except when used as a radiation sensitizer ,  radiationtherapy within 3 weeks of entry ,  lesions measurable only by ultrasound ,  or pregnancy or lactation .
Patients were prospectively stratified according to whether they had received prior radiation-sensitizer treatment (hydroxyurea ,  cisplatin , or fluorouracil) and by PS ,  and were then centrally randomized with equal probability to receive (1) cisplatin 50 mg/m with appropriate hydration every 3 weeks for a maximum of six courses ,  or (2) cisplatin 50 mg/m on day 1 plus mitolactol (180 mg/m orally for 5 days) on days 2 through 6 every 3 weeks ,  or (3) cisplatin 50mg/m plus ifosfamide 5.0 g/m over 24 hours plus mesna 6 g/m given concurrently with ifosfamide and for 12 hours after ,  every 3 weeks ,  again for a maximum of six courses .
The null hypothesis was rejected if the probability of the observed result ,  or a more extreme result ,  under the null hypothesis was less than 0.025 (one-tail test).A linear logistic model was used to adjust for age ,  PS ,  and whether cisplatin had been used as a radiosensitizer .
The adjusted relative risk of survival and progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed with a linear proportional hazards model .
Between June 1990 and January 1994 ,  454 women entered the study of whom 16 were ineligible (wrong stage ,  n = 2 ,  wrong cell type ,  n = 9 ,  wrong primary tumor ,  n = 2 ,  prior chemotherapy ,  n = 2 ,  second primary tumor ,  n = 1) ,  which left 438 eligible patients (including 10 who received no drug ,  all were included in the intent to-treat analysis) .
Also ,  more granulocytopenia ,  thrombocytopenia ,  and nausea and vomiting were associated with CIFX versus cisplatin alone (P < .025)(Table 2) .
One patient developed renal failure afterone course of CIFX and died after she had refused dialysis .
Subsequently ,  no fatal CNS toxicity was observed ,  but lesser degrees of encephalopathy continued to be observed more frequently on the CIFX arm .
There were 34 stage IVB patients ,  of whom 31 had no prior radiotherapy ,  seven of 31 (23%) had a response to protocol chemotherapy .
PFS (Fig 1) adjusted for age ,  PS ,  and prior cisplatinas a radiosensitizer was statistically significantly longer for CIFX (median ,  4.6 v 3.2 months) compared with cisplatin alone (P = .003) ,  however ,  there was no difference between C + M and cisplatin alone .
The results of this trial in cervix cancer reflect a common set of findings in combination chemotherapy of advanced solid tumors ,  namely ,  a higher response rate (but not a high CR rate) with a combination compared with single-agent therapy at the cost of more toxicity and no survival benefit .
Early experience in randomized phase II trials suggested that bleomycin and vincristine contributed importantly to combination regimens , but other randomized phase II trials have not supported a major role for these agents .
The pilot study on which the C +M arm of the present trial was based identified 180 mg/m for 5 days as the maximum-tolerated dose in combination with cisplatin .
Although we are not aware of such complications in the present trial ,  the possible risk of secondary malignancies plus the failure to show an improvement in outcome for C + M would suggest a limited future for mitolactol in the treatment of cervix cancer .
The methotrexate ,  vinblastine ,  doxorubicin , cisplatin (MVAC) regimen ,  popularized in the treatment of transitional cell bladder cancer ,  has recently been reported to be active in cervix cancer .
One of the earlier GOG trials showed an improved overall response rate (31.4% v 20.7% ,  P = .015) with double-dose cisplatin (100 mg/m2) ,  but no improvement in CR rate ,  PFI ,  or survival .
