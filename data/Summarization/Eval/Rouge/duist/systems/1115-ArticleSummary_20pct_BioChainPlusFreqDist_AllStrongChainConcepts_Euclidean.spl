Overall 5-year survival rates are reported for stage IIB cancers between 50 and 80% and from 25 to 50% for stage III .
No substantial improvements have beenmade in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer in the past two decades .
An analysis of the patterns of failure after radiation therapy in locally advanced cervical cancer reveals that of those who recur over 70% have some component of pelvic failure as the first site of relapse and two-thirds develop some component of distant disease .
As the bulk of pelvic diseaseincreases ,  the proportion of patients with disease recurrent or persistent in the pelvis as the only site of failure increases compared to the proportion developing distant metastases .
In addition to modifications of radiation therapy multiple studies have investigated ,  and are investigating ,  strategies that combine radiation with chemotherapy either as neoadjuvant or concurrent administration .
In vitro data suggested that the addition of infusional 5-FU to radiation therapy would enhance the radiation effect .
Stratification was based on a retrospective analyses which defined subgroups with different prognoses based on a combination of FIGO stage and pelvic disease volume .
The attenuator was used throughout the treatment course in those treated with a box technique and for half the fractions in those treated with a parallel pair .
Twice daily treatments on days 1 to 4 and 22 to 25 were delivered at least at 6 h apart .
If necessary to encompass disease ,  the volume could include the entire rectum .
It was loaded to extend at least 2 cm above the clinically identified superior extent of disease and inferiorly to 1 cm below the cervix or 1 cm below the lowest extent of vaginal disease identified after external therapy .
If a weekend break was necessary ,  the infusion was only given on radiotherapy treatment days .
The ‘‘Lifetest Procedure’’ in SAS UNIX was used to compare survival curves .
Where information was missing for some parameters ,  single models were fitted for these parameters .
The number excluded in each stratum were 6 in stratum 1 ,  3 in stratum 2 ,  and 4 in stratum 3 .
Ninety-nine patients were in stratum 1 ,  of which 46 were stage IB/IIA and 53 were stage IIB .
One hundred and five were in stratum 2 ,  of which 38 were stage IIB and 63 stage IIIB .
Compliance with the planned radiation schedules was good .
One hundred and eighty-seven of 221 patients had squamous cell carcinoma ,  17 adenocarcinoma ,  12 adenosquamous ,  and the remainder clear cell or unclassified .
Compliance with planned chemotherapy administration was good .
The Kaplan–Meier plots of overall disease-free survival ,  disease-free survival for each stratum ,  and disease free survival by treatment assigned are shown in Figs. 2 ,  3 ,  and4 ,  respectively .
Thereis a trend in favor of standard radiation and 5-FU .
The disease-free survival by treatment arm for the 99 patients in stratum 1 is shown in Fig. 5 .
There was a significant improvement in 5-year survival and disease-free survival for those treated with standard radiation and 5-FU compared to the other treatments (log rank test P 5 0.05) .
The actuarial 5-year disease-free survival was 76% compared to 65% for hyperfractionated irradiation plus 5-FU ,  58% for hyperfractionated irradiation alone ,  and 39% for standard radiation .
A factorial analysis of the magnitude of the impact of differences in the radiation schedule or the addition of 5-FU on the improvements in pelvic control and disease-free survival in stratum 1 was performed .
The 5-year Kaplan–Meier disease-free survival for those irradiated without 5-FU was 48% versus 71% for those who received 5-FU (log rank P 5 0.02) (Fig. 6) .
It was hoped that the use of two treatments daily during the 5-FU infusion would increase any opportunity for 5-FU-radiation interaction by increasing the total amount of radiation given concurrently with 5-FU .
For those receiving standard RT ,  the pelvic control rate was 60% but the disease-free survival was only 39% .
The crude incidence of 5.9% (13 of 221) presents a good estimate of the overall risk for chronic bowel complications in survivors ,  since most occur in the first 3 years after radiation therapy .
It was anticipated that the magnitude of benefit might vary for each stratum .
Within stratum 2 there was an improvement in pelvic control with the use of 5-FU but the difference was not statistically significant .
However ,  in stratum 1 constituted of patients with stage IB/IIA and those IIB tumors with medial parametrial involvement ,  a significant improvement in both pelvic control and disease-free survival in favor of standard radiation with concurrent 5-FU was observed (Figs. 5 and 6) .
The disease-free survival with standard radiation alone ,  however ,  was surprisingly low at 39% .
The benefits observed occurred in relation to the use of concurrent 5-FU rather than to the change in radiation fractionation .
The only significant factor predicting for disease-free survival was the use of 5-FU .
The risk ratio for recurrence and death from disease was reduced to 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 0.97) .
Such a benefit was not observed in this study .
The mechanism by which 5-FU exerts benefit is unknown ,  but may be simply by additivity due to its independent cytotoxic effect rather than to an interaction with radiation .
An alternative explanation is that 5-FU contributed to pelvic control and better pelvic control decreased the frequency of distant metastases .
From the subset analysis of this trial we have generated the hypothesis that there may be a beneficial effect of adding concurrent infusional 5-FU to standard in patients with the disease characteristics of stratum 1 .
The number of patients is too few to recommend that concurrent infusional 5-FU with pelvic irradiation should become the standard therapy for these patients .
