Several phase 2 studies have reported that concomitant treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy results in faster and more complete responses and better survival than expected with radiotherapy alone .
We elected to test this combination in a phase 3 trial to determine whether concurrent weekly treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy would improve progression-free survival and survival in women with large “bulky , ” or barrel-shaped ,  stage IB cervical cancers .
Patients with histologic evidence of lymph-node involvementwere not eligible ,  nor were those who had previously received radiotherapy or chemotherapy or those with a history of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer .
All patients were required to have a Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status of 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  or 3 (equivalent to Karnofsky performance scores of 90 or 100 ,  70 or 80 ,  50 or 60 ,  and 30 or 40 ,  respectively) and adequate bone marrow ,  renal function ,  and hepatic function .
We estimated that 173 patients were needed in each treatment group in order to be able to detect a 40 percent decrease in the recurrence rate in the group given radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
At the time of this analysis ,  69 patients in the group receiving the control regimen had had a recurrence of disease and 49 had died — 88 percent of the number of deaths needed for a final analysis of survival .
The Cox model was used to evaluate the difference between treatment regimens ,  adjust for prognostic factors ,  and estimate the relative likelihood (and 95 percent confidence intervals) of survival and progression-free survival .
Three of these patients had been randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone ,  and two had been assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin .
Pretreatment surgical evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes was optional and was performed in 13 patients (7 percent) assigned to radiotherapy alone and 14 patients (8 percent) assigned to radiotherapy and cisplatin .
There was a slightly higher percentage of patients with grade 3 tumors in the combined-therapy group (38 percent ,  vs. 31 percent in the radiotherapy group) .
Four patients assigned to the cisplatin regimen (2 percent) received no cisplatin .
One patient assigned to receive radiotherapy alone and two patients assigned to receive radiotherapyand cisplatin refused to undergo radiotherapy .
The median total treatment time was 50 days in both groups (Table 2) .
Extrafascial hysterectomy was performed after radiotherapy in 168 patients (90 percent) in the group given radiotherapy alone and 175 patients (96 percent) in the group given radiotherapy and cisplatin .
More patients in the group given radiotherapy alone refused to undergo the operation (nine ,  vs. five in the combined-therapy group) ,  and more patients in this group also had an early recurrence (eight vs. two) .
There were significantly more hysterectomy specimens without detectable cancer in the combined-therapy group than in the group given radiotherapy alone (52 percent vs. 41 percent ,  P=0.04) .
There were no treatment-related deaths ,  but 64 patients (35 percent) in the combined-therapy group had grade 3 (moderate) or grade 4 (severe) adverse effects ,  as compared with 25 patients (13 percent) in the group given radiotherapy alone .
These reactions consisted almost exclusively of transient hematologic effects (39 and 3 patients in the respective groups) and gastrointestinal effects (26 and 9 patients) (Table 3) .
Very few patients required surgical intervention for obstruction or formation of a fistula ,  and these patients were equally divided between the two groups .
The disease recurred in 69 patients in the group given radiotherapy alone (37 percent) and 38 patients given radiotherapy and cisplatin (21 percent) (Table 4) .
Forty-nine of the patients in the group given radiotherapy alone died of cervical cancer (26 percent) ,  as compared with 27 of the patients in the group given radiotherapy and cisplatin (15 percent) (Table 4) .
The threeyear survival rates were 74 percent in the group given radiotherapy alone and 83 percent in the combined-therapy group (P=0.008 by the log-rank test) (Fig. 2) .
In that study ,  the combination of concurrent radiotherapy and cisplatin-containing chemotherapy was superior to treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy .
They compared treatment with radiation and hydroxyurea ,  treatment with radiation and weekly cisplatin ,  and treatment with radiation and hydroxyurea ,  cisplatin ,  and fluorouracil and found that the rate of relapse-free survival was significantly higher in both regimens containing cisplatin .
In addition to these three trials ,  two other randomized trials have also found that combining radiotherapy and cisplatin-containing chemotherapy improves survival and disease-free survival .
In the earlier Gynecologic Oncology Group study that assessed the value of extrafascial hysterectomy after radiotherapy ,  surgery was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of relapses in the pelvic region ,  but the overall risk of recurrence was not significantly reduced (relative risk ,  0.76 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.52 to 1.12) and there was no significant difference in survival (relative risk of death ,  0.91) .
The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment ,  but they share a common result ,  all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin .
This remarkable consistency offers a compelling reason to consider cisplatin therapy in combination with radiotherapy as a new standard of care for patients with bulky stage IB ,  stage IIB through IVA ,  and high-risk cervical cancers .
