The first UK Medical Research Council (MRC) trial of preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer was a three-arm randomised trial with 824 patients comparing a control (surgery alone) group with a group treated with 20 Gy given in 10 equal fractions and another treated with a single exposure of 5 Gy .
These doses of radiation were chosen after trials by the Veterans Administration Surgical Adjuvant Group and the Princess Margaret Hospital ,  Toronto ,  suggested survival advantage with radiotherapy for patients with tumours of Dukes stage C .
Despite the suggestion of a real biological effect of the radiotherapy in the first MRC trial ,  with significant changes in tumour stage ,  no advantage was found for either radiotherapy group over the control group in terms of disease recurrence or survival .
Eligible patients were men or women younger than 80 years who ,  had histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum partially or totally fixed within the pelvis with the lower margin of the tumour within 15 cm of the anal verge ,  were deemed suitable and fit for the proposed treatment and available for regular follow-up ,  were free of disseminated disease (confirmed by clinical and radiological examination) ,  and had had no previous malignant disease .
Eligibility was confirmed and treatment allocated by minimisation on three factors ,  treatment centre ,  extension of tumour (fixed or partially fixed) ,  and intended operation (abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection) .
Two parallel opposed fields 18 cm by 15 cm were positioned to cover the tumour with an adequate proximal margin (normally 5 cm). 20 daily fractions of 2 Gy at the mid-plane central axis of the volume of the tumour were given over 4 weeks .
Patients who completed 5 years follow-up and those who were lost to follow-up were flagged on the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) register so that we would be notified of date and cause of death .
Criteria for suspicion of local recurrence were pain ,  increasing in severity and requiring medication ,  or disturbance of bladder function ,  induration in the perineum or pelvis on examination ,  or palpation of a mass in the pelvis or at the anastomosis .
For all these endpoints ,  event-free times were censored at 5 years from randomisation ,  because at this point a large proportion of surviving patients had been discharged from hospital follow-up ,  and accurate continuing data on disease recurrence were no longer available .
The surviving patients were followed-up for a minimum of 5 years with the exception of seven patients ,  lost to follow-up within 5 years of randomisation ,  who could not be traced through the OPCS and were censored at the date last known to be alive .
Pretreatment characteristics of the patients were well balanced (table 1). 69 (49%) of 140 patients allocated surgery only had partially fixed tumours and 71 (51%) had fixed tumours .
Nine patients received less than the prescribed dose of radiation ,  two received no radiotherapy because they were judged too ill ,  three failed to complete the full treatment because of their deteriorating condition ,  and treatment was stopped early in four patients (ischiorectal abscess and perineal breakdown ,  bowel obstruction ,  a prearranged time for surgery ,  and refusal to continue by the patient) .
The proportion of tumours graded as Dukes C was significantly lower in the radiotherapy group than in the surgery alone group (29 vs 59% ,  p.0.0002) and the number of involved lymph nodes was also smaller .
At follow-up ,  surgeons were asked to report on the status of the patients' abdominal and (if applicable) perineal wounds ,  and to describe ,  in broad terms ,  any late complications .
Complications associated with the colostomy were reported in ten surgery alone patients and eight radiotherapy patients ,  and five patients in each group had anastomosis-related complications after anterior restorative resection .
The hazard ratio is 0¡¤68 (95% CI of 0.47-0.98) ,  which suggests that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by a third .
However ,  cause-specific survival analysis suggests a larger benefit for radiotherapy .
Fewer deaths were reported to have been from colorectal cancer or complications of the disease or its treatment among patients allocated preoperative radiotherapy than among those allocated surgery alone (85 vs 103 ,  hazard ratio 0.71 [0.54-0.97] ,  p=0.02) .
Failure to recruit the planned number of patients is reflected in the wide 95% CI seen for each of the main endpoints .
The reasons for investigating preoperative radiation therapy were ,  reduction in size of the primary tumour and frequency of regional node metastases before resection ,  a reduction in the frequency of local pelvic recurrence and of distant metastasis from cancer cells released during resection (preoperative treatment can inhibit the proliferation of malignant cells whether they remain local or spread outside the pelvis after radiation) ,  radiation responsiveness of cancer cells may be greater before surgery when they are normally oxygenated than afterwards when they may be hypoxic because of surgical effects on the vasculature ,  and a lower frequency of late radiation enteritis because the small bowel is less likely to be adherent in the pelvis .
Patients in the preoperative radiotherapy treatment group ,  in which a moderately high dose of radiation was to be used ,  had their surgery delayed by 2 months (1 month to cover the radiotherapy fractionation and a further month for tumour regression to occur and for the normal tissues to recover from the radiation) .
Several Swedish studies have advanced the case for the use of preoperative rather than postoperative radiation in terms of better patient compliance ,  greater reduction in local recurrence rates ,  and lower morbidity .
Moreover ,  current practice is to give a short course of high-dose radiation (25 Gy over 5.7 days) and to proceed to immediate surgery ,  thus avoiding the long delay before surgery .
The combined evidence from all these trials should yield sufficient numbers to answer precisely the questions of the effect of preoperative radiotherapy on local and distant recurrence ,  and above all the effect on survival .
