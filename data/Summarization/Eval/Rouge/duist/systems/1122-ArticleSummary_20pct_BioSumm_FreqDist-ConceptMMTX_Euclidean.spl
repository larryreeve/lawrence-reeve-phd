The preferred treatment of women with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO IA2–IIA) is radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy .
The procedure is well tolerated ,  with minimal associated morbidity and rare mortality .
The clinicopathologic factors which predict a poorer prognosis for patients with an early carcinoma of the cervix have been well established .
These factors have been shown to be associated with a high risk of recurrence in other studies ,  both from single institutions and from cooperative groups .
Randomization was performed at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center by the Department of Biostatistics using an envelope system .
Data forms were maintained in a central location ,  also at MSKCC .
The alternative hypothesis considered that chemotherapy alone would result in a 5-year disease-free survival of 20% less or 50% (significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80) .
The trial was closed to patient entry in June 1994 due to less than optimal accrual .
Five of 12 chemotherapy alone .
There skin reaction .
DISCUSSION .
group of patients treated with chemotherapy alone .
Patterns for an early-stage cervical cancer has generally focused on of recurrence did not appear to be significantly different ,  as whether radiation therapy alone is beneficial in reducing presented in Table 2. recurrence rates .
Radiation therapy alone probably reduces .
Twelve of the 19 recurrences were either local recurrences only or local plus distant metastases ,  with no difference in the number of local occurrences between the two treatment arms .
The closure of this clinical trial prior to completion of the accrual goal was disappointing .
