Loco-regional and distant relapses contribute to impair theoutcome of rectal cancer patients) As to the former ,  eitherpre- or post-operative radiation therapy (RT) significantlyreduce loco-regional recurrence ,  post-operative chemotherapy(CT) ,  alone or in different combinations with RT , is effective in improving both disease-free survival andsurvival .
The primary endpoint is overall survival ,  secondaryendpoints are disease-free survival ,  rate of loco-regionalrecurrence ,  and treatment-related toxicity/morbidity .
Patients randomized in Arm II begin with the first cycle of 5-FU (450 mg/sqm/d iv bolus on days 1-5) plus ievamisole (150 mg/d orally on days 1-3) .
The other five cycles of CT (5-FU every 28 days ,  and levamisole every 15 days for the whole length of 5-FU administration) continue at the end of RT ,  provided that all clinical and haemato-biochemical parameters are within the normal range .
The primary end-point of the study is overall survival and the expected 5-year survival in RT-treated patients is 50% ,  hence ,  175 patients will be enrolled in each arm to obtain 80% power of the study related to 15% increase of 5-year survival in RT+CT treated patients .
The median randomization time occurred on the 19th post-operative day (range ,  6-24 days) ,  on average ,  patients began RT 43 days from surgery (range ,  27-98 days) .
