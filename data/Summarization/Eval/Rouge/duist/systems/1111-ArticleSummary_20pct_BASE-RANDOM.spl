However ,  sufficient data have been reported in the literature to categorize LTD ,  DSI ,  and CLS as independent risk factors because of their frequent association with increased cancer recurrence and mortality .
In 1988 the GOG initiated a prospective randomized study (GOG #92) ,  reported here ,  to investigate the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy for Stage I cervical cancer patients treated by conventional radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who were at high risk for recurrence ,  because of LTD ,  DSI ,  CLS ,  but excluding patients with lymph node metastases .
Eligibility .
Radical hysterectomy required removal of the uterus and contiguous parametrial tissue to its most lateral extent along with paravaginal tissue and upper quarter of the vagina along the proximal uterosacral ligaments .
The pelvic irradiation was given with a fourfield technique with a megavoltage beam ,  although cobalt-60 was allowed if the SSD was greater than 80 cm. Radiation dose was from 46 Gy in 23 fractions to 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions ,  5 fractions per week .
Each patient was to be given daily fractions of 1.80 –2.00 Gy over 41/2 to 6 weeks .
The Radiotherapy Committee examined therapy forms ,  diagrams of irradiated fields ,  dosimetry curves ,  and portal fields for each external field .
Life tables were computed using the method of Kaplan and Meier .
Twenty-two patients were excluded ,  14 because of lack of documentation of high risk criteria ,  4 for wrong stage ,  1 for inadequate surgery ,  2 for inadequate pathology material for review ,  and 1 for not having an intravenous pyelogram or CT scan .
The tumor cell type was squamous in 218 (79%) women ,  adenosquamous in 32 (12%) ,  and adenocarcinoma in 27 (10%) .
There were 128 (46%) patients with the risk factors of positive CLS and deep one-third stromal invasion ,  65 (23%) had positive CLS ,  middle third stromal invasion and tumor size $2 cm ,  82 (30%) had negative CLS ,  middle or deep third stromal invasion and a $4-cm tumor ,  and 2 (0.7%) had positive CLS ,  superficial stromal invasion ,  and tumor size $5 cm (Table 3) .
Notably ,  there were only 2 isolated vaginal vault recurrences in the irradiated group versus 8 among the NFT patients .
Eighty-six percent of patients have either died or have been followed at least 3 years .
Within 2 years on study ,  there are eight and three patients in the RT group and NFT group ,  respectively .
The difference between treatment groups remained statistically significant .
Of the 3 patients with grade 4 toxicities ,  1 patient had a complication involving the urogenital tract ,  1 gastrointestinal ,  and 1 both hematologic and urogenital toxicity .
The risk factors used to select patients for this study have been investigated and reported in the literature .
Both large tumor diameter and deep stromal invasion are indices of large tumor volume ,  conceivably affecting cancer progression and its metastatic spread .
Chung et al. reported that cervical cancer larger than 4 cm in diameter determined by preoperative palpation was associated with a 5-fold increase in pelvic lymph node metastases ,  a 10-fold increase in recurrences ,  and a 50% decrease in survival .
Sedlis et al. ,  in a GOG study of microinvasive cervical carcinoma ,  reported two deaths among the 23% patients with vascular spread .
Boyce et al. emphasized that a combination of risk factors correlated better with the survival than one factor alone .
Of the three risk factors ,  depth of invasion seems the most objective and accurate method—a direct measurement on the histological slide .
Significant interobserver variability was reported by Zaino et al. in a recent study on reproducibility of pathologists assessment of vascular invasion and other histological predictors .
The formula combining the three risk factors that we used to determine patient eligibility may appear complicated .
A detailed GOG clinical pathologic study had established that certain patients with poor prognostic factors related to the primary tumor (i.e. ,  large tumor size ,  deep stromal invasion ,  and capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement) but without lymph node involvement had a risk of recurrence of 31% after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy .
The use of adjuvant radiotherapy to improve the outcome in the Stage I cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter ,  deep invasion ,  and CLS has been previously proposed .
However ,  no such evidence from randomized trials is available about effective treatment of positive lymph nodes .
Our present study confirms both predicted and reported benefits from postoperative radiation.It should be noted that the 27% recurrence rate at 3 years in our study population is lower than the anticipated one-third .
This difference can be explained by an overestimation of risk by the regression model which commonly occurs ,  this phenomena is sometimes referred to as regression to the mean .
Especially vulnerable to adverse radiation effects are the bladder and the ureters due to compromised circulation from surgical dissection and the intestines because of adhesions and reduced motility .
