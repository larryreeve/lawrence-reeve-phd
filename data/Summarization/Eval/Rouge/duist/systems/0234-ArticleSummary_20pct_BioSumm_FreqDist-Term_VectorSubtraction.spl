Its use ,  however ,  is limited by cumulative ,  dose-dependent ,  chronic cardiotoxicity .
Epirubicin (4'-epi-doxorubicin ,  EPI) is one such compound .
It is a stereoisomer of DOX in which the hydroxyl group at the 4' position of the aminosugar side chain is epimerized (Fig 1) .
The antitumor activity of EPI in animal models is similar to that of DOX ,  but EPI is a less toxic compound with regard to both cytotoxicity and cardiac injury .
The acute toxicity was qualitatively similar to that seen with DOX .
Biochemical profiles were repeated every six weeks .
Study DesignAfter determining eligibility ,  informed consent was obtained .
All patients were then randomly assigned to receive either EPI or DOX .
DOX was prepared in accordance with the package insert .
It was anticipated that these doses would produce equivalent degrees of myelosuppression .
Neither patients nor physicians were blinded with respect to treatment .
Cardiac toxicity was assessed in all patients by both clinical evaluation and RNCA .
Clinical examination was performed prior to each dose of anthracycline .
LVEF was determined by computer-assisted analysis of left ventricular time-activity curves .
Imaging was obtained for three minutes at the point of maximal tolerable exercise .
All hypothesis tests were two-sided .
The characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1 .
Although all patients had received prior chemotherapy which included cyclophosphamide or other alkylating agent ,  no patient had been previously treated with mitomycin C .
No patient was being treated with digitalis glycosides or antiarrhythmics .
Complete responses were not observed in either arm .
One patient receiving EPI died of nadir sepsis .
This patient had been extensively treated with radiation and chemotherapy before treatment on this protocol .
Other common toxicities included nausea ,  vomiting ,  and alopecia .
Nausea or vomiting was documented in 58% of patients who received EPI and 67% of the patients who were treated with DOX .
In general ,  the nausea and vomiting in patients on the EPI arm was less severe .
All patients are included in the analysis of cardiotoxicity .
Thus ,  all EPI doses were multiplied by 52/85 to compare the two drugs in equivalent units ,  and Kaplan-Meier estimates plotted (Fig 2B) .
The difference remains statistically significant with a P value of .04 .
Of the ten remaining patients on the EPI arm and elevenpatients on the DOX arm who are not evaluable for laboratory cardiac toxicity because they did not have a second RNCA study ,  the total cumulative doses of EPI and DOX were not significantly different ,  whether or not myelosuppressiveequivalent doses were taken into consideration .
This sometimes ,  but not always ,  occurred  before the development of symptomatic congestive cardiomyopathy .
Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the cardiotoxic effects of DOX .
Modification of the traditional schedule of DOX administration has been advocated as a method to reduce cardiac injury .
This suggests that EPI might have a better therapeutic index in patients with cancer .
The optimal method for monitoring the cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines is controversial .
However ,  RNCA alone has also been useful in studying anthracycline cardiotoxicity .
Although endomyocardial biopsy is probably the definitive measure of cardiac injury ,  RNCA has the advantage of being noninvasive and ,  therefore ,  acceptable to virtually all patients in a randomized study of antineoplastic agents .
It was also similar to the combined experience in the literature with DOX as a single agent in previously treated women with breast cancer .
The design of these studies differed ,  however .
In the other single agent study ,  in which there was an empiric dose limitation of 600 mg/m2 ,  none of the seven EPItreated patients who had RNCA experienced a decline in LVEF of > 10% .
In the multidrug study ,  no clinical cardiac dysfunction was seen in the EPI-containing (FEC) arm .
