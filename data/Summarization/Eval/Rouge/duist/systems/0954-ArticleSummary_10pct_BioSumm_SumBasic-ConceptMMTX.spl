Nevertheless ,  there are reasons to reconsider radiotherapy ,  including the limited value of adjuvant chemotherapy for bulky disease ,  a synergistic effect of chemotherapy plus radiation on residual locoregional tumor ,  and the possibility that eliminating bulky disease with radiation may improve the effect of chemotherapy ,  because chemotherapy may be more effective when the overall disease burden is low .
From 1979 through 1986 ,  318 premenopausal women with newly diagnosed stage I or II breast cancer were enrolled in the study after undergoing modified radical mastectomy if ,  after axillary-node dissection ,  one or more level I or II lymph nodes were found to be positive on pathological examination .
Also ,  as part of a second randomization ,  68 patients with estrogen-positive tumors were treated with radiationinduced ovarian ablation that included 20 Gy over a period of five days plus prednisone (7.5 mg per day) for two years ,  as described by Meakin et al. Among these 68 patients ,  33 were assigned to chemotherapy and 35 were assigned to chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
In the various analyses ,  we studied the following end points ,  any relapse of breast cancer (or death without a known relapse of breast cancer) ,  for the analysis of disease-free survival ,  locoregional recurrence as a first event ,  before a systemic recurrence (in the ipsilateral chest wall or an axillary ,  internal mammary ,  or supraclavicular node) ,  for the analysis of survival free of locoregional disease ,  any systemic relapse ,  with or without a locoregional relapse (or death without a known systemic relapse) ,  for the analysis of survival free of systemic disease ,  death from breast cancer ,  for the analysis of breast-cancer–specific survival ,  and any death ,  for the analysis of overall survival .
There was an overall reduction of 34 percent in the rate of systemic recurrence (relative risk ,  0.66 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.49 to 0.89 ,  P 0.006) in the group treated with combined therapy (75 of 164 patients vs. 94 of 154 patients in the group treated only with chemotherapy) ,  and a 17-percentage-point improvement in systemic disease-free survival (Fig. 2) .
The incidence of second cancers and the associated mortality were distributed evenly between the two groups (Table 4) .
Our trial did not stratify the patients according to nodal status ,  but a test for interaction showed no significant difference in the magnitude of the benefit from radiotherapy between the subgroup with three or fewer positive nodes and the subgroup with four or more positive nodes .
The patients in that study were similar to those in our cohort ,  there was a large and homogeneous group of premenopausal ,  node-positive patients treated with chemotherapy and five-field radiotherapy .
The other eight studies were notsimilar to ours or the Danish trial ,  either because the number of randomized premenopausal patients was small or because the radiotherapy techniques or the chemotherapy schedules were heterogeneous .
Four randomized trials comparing breast irradiation with no irradiation in patients who underwent conservative surgery showed significant reductions in the rate of relapse in the breast but no effect on systemic recurrences or overall survival .
