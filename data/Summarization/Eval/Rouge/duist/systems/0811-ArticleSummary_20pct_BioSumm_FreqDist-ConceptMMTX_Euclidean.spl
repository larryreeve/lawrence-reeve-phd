ADVANCED colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common oncologic challenges encountered in the Western world .
These effects presumably occur through the action of thymidine in blocking oxidative metabolism of 5-FU and increasing 5-FU incorporation into RNA .
They also observed one additional response among patients who had failed 5-FU .
PALA is a potent inhibitor of aspartate transcarbamylase and has a broad spectrum of activity in animal model tumor screens .
Two randomized ,  controlled studies have raised the possibility that it may have some role in the treatment of colorectal carcinoma .
Patient Selection .
5-FU alone. 5-FU was administered in undiluted form by rapid intravenous (IV) injection at a dose of 500 mg/m2 daily for 5 consecutive days .
On day I. 5-FU was administered 4 hours after PALA .
On days 2 through 5 ,  5-FU was administered after PALA. but no delay was required .
This corresponded to the method used by the New York Memorial group .
For all regimens .
WBC count and platelet counts were obtained weekly .
For the comparison of any one of our drug combinations with 5-FU. this would permit our test for treatment effect to have .90 probability of detecting a true doubling in survival time (eg. from 6 to 12 months). while having only a .05 probability of obtaining a false-positive result when there were no true differences in survival .
The log rank statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with equality of survival curves ,  while the Cox partial likelihood score statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with the hypothesis that any one of the combinations would yield at least a 50% improvement in survival over 5-FU alone .
P values were two-sided .
Early termination did not occur .
A total of 347 patients were randomized on this study .
A total of 335 eligible patients were properly started on therapy and are included in the analysis below .
These represent 97% of all patients randomized .
The pretreatment characteristics of our patients are displayed according to the treatment arm in Table 1 .
It is noteworthy that most of these patients were in excellent general condition .
One patient died in irreversible coma .
There were three treatment-related deaths ,  one each on 5-FU alone ,  5-FU plus thymidine ,  and MOF-Strept .
Therapeutic Results .
The intervals to disease progression are shown in Fig 1 .
There was no suggestion that any of the combination regimens performed in a superior fashion to 5-FU used alone ,  and it is unlikely that any could produce as much as a 50% increase in time to progression (P < .05) for each regimen v 5-FU alone .
DISCUSSION .
In each of the regimens we tested ,  drug dosages and scheduling were admittedly largely arbitrary .
It is entirely possible that different proportionate representation of drug dosages or different scheduling could produce more favorable or less favorable results than we observed .
Unfortunately ,  there is little in the way of reliably predictable animal model experimentation to serve as a foundation for rational dosage regimens in humans .
This allowed for 60% of the full dose of both 5-FU and PALA to be administered .
The total dose of 5-FU in this combination was only 12% of the dosage of 5-FU used alone that would produce a comparable degree of hematologic toxicity .
