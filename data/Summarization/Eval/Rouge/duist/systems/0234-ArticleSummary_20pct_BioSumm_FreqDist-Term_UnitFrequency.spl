In retrospective studies ,  the incidence of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) was estimated to be approximately 3% to 4% after a cumulative DOX dose of 450 mg/m2 and 6% to 10% after 550 mg/m2 ,  the incidence of CHF rises steeply after higher cumulative doses.On the basis of these retrospective studies ,  an empiric dose limitation of 450 to 550 mg/m2 has been recommended when DOX is used on a standard every three week schedule .
We used multigated radionuclide cineangiocardiography (RNCA) to assess cardiac toxicity in this prospective ,  randomized study comparing the efficacy ,  acute ,  and chronic toxicities of EPI with DOX in patients with advanced breast cancer .
Evaluation of ToxicityThe percent of projected dose received was calculated for each patient as the average of all doses the patient received (mg/m 2) - 85 if the patient was randomized to EPI and - 60 if the patient was randomized to DOX .
No such dose limitation was imposed for patients on the EPI arm ,  as the toxic cumulative dose of EPI was not established at the onset of this study .
Eight patients on the EPI arm and 14 on the DOX arm had received prior radiotherapy to the chest ,  mediastinum ,  or thoracic spine that may have exposed the myocardium to ionizing radiation .
In addition ,  four patients who received EPI and six who received DOX had a history of wellcontrolled systemic arterial hypertension .
The median actual dose administered was 100% of the projected dose of EPI and 86% of the planned dose of DOX (Wilcoxon test ,  P = .01) .
Response Rates and DurationsTwenty-four patients on the EPI arm and 28 patients on the DOX arm are evaluable for therapeutic response (Table 2) .
Six (25%) of the 24 evaluable patients treated with EPI and seven (25%) of the 28 evaluable patients on the DOX arm achieved PRs .
There was no difference (log rank test ,  P = .90) in the median time to progression between the patients on the EPI arm (3.9 months) and those on the DOX arm (5.1 months) .
The median WBC nadir was 2.0 x 103/gL (range ,  0.1 to 8.6) and the median platelet nadir was 132 x 103//pL (range ,  20.0 to 279.0) in patients receiving EPI ,  the median WBC nadir was 1.8 x 10'/3tL (range ,  0.3 to .9) and median platelet nadir was 130 x 103/pL (range 24.0 to 253.0) in patients on the DOX arm .
Nausea or vomiting was documented in 58% of patients who received EPI and 67% of the patients who were treated with DOX .
Because all patients had been treated previously with chemotherapy ,  the degree and incidence of alopecia is difficult to assess ,  however ,  hair loss was noted in 50% of patients treated with EPI and 35% of those treated with DOX .
Mucositis was observed in only 4% of patients on the EPI arm ,  and in 6% of patients receiving DOX .
Fifteen patients on the EPI arm and 18 patients on the DOX arm had at least one followup RNCA and were evaluable for laboratory cardiotoxicity .
Eight patients treated with EPI and nine patients treated with DOX had laboratory evidence of cardiotoxicity .
The median cumulative dose to laboratory cardiotoxicity in these patients was 892 mg/m2 of EPI and 360 mg/m 2 of DOX .
The median dose to development of cardiotoxicity for all evaluable patients was 935 mg/m2 for EPI and 468 mg/m2 for DOX (Fig 2A) .
Overall ,  100% of the planned dose of EPI (85 mg/m2) was administered ,  however ,  only 86% (52 mg/m2) of the planned dose of DOX was given .
Of the ten remaining patients on the EPI arm and elevenpatients on the DOX arm who are not evaluable for laboratory cardiac toxicity because they did not have a second RNCA study ,  the total cumulative doses of EPI and DOX were not significantly different ,  whether or not myelosuppressiveequivalent doses were taken into consideration .
Four patients treated with EPI and five patients treated with DOX developed clinical congestive heart failure (CHF) .
The cumulative doses of EPI at which clinical CHF was observed (1,035 ,  1,105 ,  1,162 ,  and 1,234 mg/m 2) were approximately twice the cumulative doses of DOX at which CHF was seen (456 ,  480 ,  492 ,  560 ,  and 600 mg/m2) .
One of the patients who developed CHF on the DOX arm is the patient who had the initial resting LVEF of 48% ,  this patient also had a history of pulmonary emboli and it was unclear whether this contributed to her cardiac decompensation .
On the DOX arm ,  one of the patients who developed CHF had prior radiation exposure to the heart ,  one had hypertension ,  and one had prior radiotherapy as well as hypertension .
There was a statistically significant greater cumulative dose to CHF for patients receiving EPI (log rank test ,  P - .008) with and without adjustment for the difference in myelosuppressive potency .
Since only five patients treated with DOX and four treated with EPI actually developed clinical heart failure ,  this result should not be overinterpreted .
Among patients who experienced clinical CHF ,  however ,  the median cumulative doses to CHF were 1,134 mg/m2 of EPI and 492 mg/m 2 of DOX .
In a prospective adjuvant chemotherapy trial for patients with soft-tissue sarcomas ,  14% of patients who received 430 to 600 mg/m2 of DOX developed clinical CHF .
Thirteen percent of patients in another recent study developed CHF at a median dose of 405 mg/m 2 when DOX was given on an every three week schedule. 22 With optimal monitoring ,  one might be able to detect subclinical cardiac injury and prevent CHF by stopping the drug ,  this implies ,  however ,  the interruption of effective antineoplastic therapy .
The difference in cardiac toxicity was manifested by the difference in total cumulative dose at which changes in LVEF occurred (Fig 2A) ,  as well as by the difference in dose at which clinical CHF was seen (EPI ,  1,035 to 1,234 mg/m 2 v DOX ,  456 to 600 mg/m2) .
Although these results could have been affected by the greater incidence of cardiac irradiation inpatients treated with DOX ,  only three patients who had received such radiotherapy actually developed CHF ,  one on the EPI arm and two on the DOX arm .
A third study34 compared two multidrug combinations in which 5-fluorouracil (F) 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide (C) 500 mg/m2 were combined with an equal dosage (50 mg/m2) of either EPI (FEC [5-fluorouracil ,  EPI ,  cyclophosphamidel) or DOX (FAC) and administered every three weeks ,  the total dose of EPI was limited to 750 mg/m2 and of DOX to 550 mg/m2 .
Since the present study did not use a fixed limitation for dose of EPI ,  patients who did not have progression of tumor were treated to the point of laboratory cardiotoxicity or clinical CHF ,  therefore ,  this study provides cumulative cardiotoxicity data that are not available in the other two studies .
At cumulative EPI doses of 600 to 700 mg/m2 ,  two (13%) of the 15 evaluable patients at risk for RNCA changes developed a decrease in LVEF of > 10% .
Although the numbers are small ,  in the Milan study three of five patients treated with DOX in whom RNCA was performed showed a decrease in LVEF of more than 10% (375 ,  450 ,  and 525 mg/m2) .
Most patients in our trials received less than 550 mg/m2 of EPI ,  however ,  in 11 patients receiving cumulative EPI doses from 550 to 1,465 mg/m2 ,  RNCA abnormalities were observed in only four patients at 970 ,  1,180,1,190 ,  and 1,465 mg/m2 ,  respectively (C.W .
Assuming equal therapeutic potency ,  this analysis indicated that every three week EPI is less cardiotoxic than every three week DOX (P = .0005) and borderline less toxic than weekly DOX (P = .06) .
Although at times a decrease in LVEF was observed immediately before the development of CHF ,  we were unable to confirm the previously described pattern of predictable progressive decline in LVEF over time for all patients.6 Many patients maintained their left ventricular function at the baseline value until it worsened abruptly shortly before or at the time that clinical CHF was observed .
Our results show that EPI has therapeutic activity that is similar to that of DOX in patients with advanced breast cancer ,  and that EPI is a less cardiotoxic drug than DOX ,  even accounting for the difference in myelosuppressive potency .
In this study ,  worsening cardiac function forced the premature discontinuation of DOX therapy in three patients experiencing partial responses ,  whereas effective treatment with EPI was never discontinued because of cardiac toxicity .
