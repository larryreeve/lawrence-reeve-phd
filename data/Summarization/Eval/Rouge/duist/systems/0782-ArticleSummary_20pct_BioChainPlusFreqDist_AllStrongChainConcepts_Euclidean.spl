More evidence has emerged lately ,  however ,  that adjuvant chemotherapy of colon cancer may be beneficial .
Overt liver metastases seem to be the first site of relapse for 40-50%of patients with operable disease .
Based on these results ,  several prospective randomised comparisons of intraportal infusion of various regimens after surgery and surgery alone were initiated .
Between July ,  1981 ,  and March ,  1987 ,  we enrolled 533 patients with adenocarcinoma of colon or rectum who were about to undergo curative resection and were younger than 75 years .
Postoperatively ,  blood counts and liver function tests were done on days 1 ,  3 ,  5 ,  7 ,  10 ,  14 ,  28 ,  and 42.Resected tissue was examined by histology and classified (Dukes' classification ,  Astler-Coller modification) .
To be eligible ,  patients had to have no evidence of metastatic disease in preoperative investigations. 29 patients had liver metastases diagnosed at resection and 8 had incomplete resection .
The 37 patients who had metastases diagnosed at surgery or had incomplete resection were regarded as having relapsed on the day of surgery. 5 patients were lost to follow-up .
All probability values were two-sided .
The distribution of site of first relapse is given in terms of simple proportions since the two treatment groups had equal lengths of follow-up .
These were essentially descriptive in nature ,  therefore we did not attempt to use multivariate methods of evaluation ,  and the reported p values should be interpreted with caution .
Results .
Treatment outcome was similar in all subgroups ,  and was best in that with positive nodes .
These abnormalities had resolved at the first follow-up examination .
This trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase survival in patients with colorectal cancer .
Adjuvant chemotherapy reduced the risk of recurrence by 21 % and the risk of death by 26% .
This effect was observed in all subgroups ,  but was greatest in patients with tumour-involved lymph nodes (33%) and in those with colon cancer (22%) .
Most were multicentre trials and some excluded patients with rectal cancer .
For further studies ,  we recommend that patients with insulin-dependent diabetes ,  a high risk of postoperative complications (obesity ,  cardiac ,  and/or pulmonary disease) ,  or any evidence of intra-abdominal sepsis at laparotomy or during the early postoperative period ,  should be excluded from participation .
This low incidence of surgical complications suggests advances in surgical technique and in patient management before and after elective cancer surgery ,  that allow safe use of adjuvant chemotherapy soon after surgical intervention .
