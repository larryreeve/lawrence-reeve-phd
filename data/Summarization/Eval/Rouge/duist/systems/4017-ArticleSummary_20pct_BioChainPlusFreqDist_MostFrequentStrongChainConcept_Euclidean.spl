Survival time in these patients is typically short .
The secondary endpoints for efficacy were time to progression ,  duration of response ,  time to treatment failure ,  and overall survival .
Time to progression was the time from randomisation to progression .
The duration of response was the time from first infusion to progression in responding patients .
The duration of response and stabilisation was the time from first infusion to progression in responding and stable patients .
The time to treatment failure was the time from randomisation to treatment discontinuation or progression of disease ,  whichever came first .
We estimated survival curves by the Kaplan-Meier method ,  and compared the two groups by the log-rank test .
We tested the nine following variables ,  sex ,  WHO performance status (<2 and <=2) ,  weight loss (<=5% and >5%) ,  number of organs involved (<3 and <=3) ,  primary tumour site (colon or rectum) ,  organ involvement (liver only or other sites) ,  time from first diagnosis to first metastasis (0.3 ,  >3-12 ,  >12 months) ,  previous surgery ,  and previous adjuvant therapy .
For time to progression ,  Cox's proportional hazards modelling was used ,  with the following variables ,  sex ,  age (<58 and <=58 years) ,  WHO performance status (<2 and >= 2) ,  weight loss (<=5% and >5%) ,  number of organs involved (<3 and >=3) ,  primary tumour site (colon or rectum) ,  liver involvement ,  lymph-node involvement ,  time from first diagnosis to first metastasis (0-3 ,  >3.12 ,  >12 months) ,  previous surgery ,  previous adjuvant therapy ,  time from first diagnosis and first infusion (<9 and <=9 months) .
The time to definitive deterioration from baseline by 5% ,  10% ,  20% ,  and 30% was analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method .
We used log-rank tests to compare the two groups .
The median duration of treatment was longer in the irinotecan than in the no-irinotecan group ,  irrespective of regimen (24.0 vs 21.0 weeks for the weekly regimen ,  24.6 vs 18.0 for the 2-weekly regimen) .
In the did not enable provision of an accurate estimation of the intention-to-treat population ,  response rate was also significantly higher in the irinotecan group than in the noirinotecan group (34.8 [28.2-41.9] vs 21.9% [16.2-28.5] ,  p=0.005 ,  table 2) .
The median time to onset of response was 8.9 (range 4.7-25.4) weeks in the irinotecan group medians.21 The probability of survival in the irinotecan group was 84.9% at 9 months and 75.5% at 12 months ,  and in the no-irinotecan group was 77.3% and 62.7% ,  respectively .
In the intention-to-treat analysis of the 2weekly regimen ,  the response rate was ,  for the irinotecan and 11.4 (5.3-29.6) weeks in the no-irinotecan group .
The median duration of response was 9.3 (2.8-13.1) months in the irinotecan group and 8.8 (3.7-11.8) months in the no-irinotecan group (p=0.08) .
Time to progression was longer in the irinotecan than in the noirinotecan group (median 6.7 [0+.13.8+] vs 4.4 group and the no-irinotecan group ,  33.1% (95% CI 25.5-41.4) and 21.0% (14.6-28.6 ,  p=0.021) ,  median time to progression was 6.5 (range 0+.13.2) months and 3.7 (0+.13.1+) months (p=0.001) ,  and median survival was 17.4 (0.4-28.3+) months and 13.0 (0.5-27.6+) months .
Median followirinotecan group was 69.8% and 54.8% ,  respectively .
In the stepwise multivariate logistic regression (table 3) ,  weight loss of 5% or less at baseline and time between first diagnosis and first metastasis were predictive of response. up was 23.3 (20.0-29.7) months .
There was insufficient power to compare the efficacy risk of progression for a patient in the no-irinotecan group was increased by about 69% compared with that for a patient in the irinotecan group when all other variables were equal .
The median time to treatment failure was 5.3 (0.4-15.7+) months in the irinotecan group and 3.8 (0.4-11.5+) months in the no-irinotecan group (p=0.0014) .
The time to definitive deterioration in performance status was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group (median 11.2 [0.1+.15.7+]) vs 9.9 [0+.13¡¤6+] months ,  p=0.046 ,  figure 4 ) .
In the irinotecan group ,  diarrhoea and neutropenia were the most common toxic effects in each regimen ,  and were significantly more frequent and severe than in the noirinotecan group .
With the 2-weekly regimen ,  diarrhoea was more frequent in the irinotecan group than in the noirinotecan group ,  and the difference was close to siginificance in the weekly regimen .
Grade 3 or 4 infection without grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was significantly more frequent in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group .
Doses were reduced because of toxic effects more frequently for the weekly regimen than for the 2-weekly regimen ,  and more in the irinotecan than in the noirinotecan group .
Doses were reduced in 29.6% of patients on the weekly regimen and 18.6% on the 2 weekly regimen in the irinotecan and no-irinotecan groups ,  respectively ,  and in 20.9% and 4.9% on the 2 weekly regimen .
The rate of return was similar in the two treatment groups.62% in the irinotecan group and 59% in the no-irinotecan group .
The two groups did not differ significantly at baseline ,  except for cognitive function (mean 89.9 [SE 1.1] vs 86.1 [1.5] ,  p=0.05) .
When missing data for death ,  progressive disease ,  or grade 3.4 adverse events were taken into account with the two imputation methods ,  results were biased in favour of the no-irinotecan group .
Another phase III study that compared irinotecan combined with bolus fluorouracil and fluorouracil alone consistently provided significantly higher response rates (33 vs 18% ,  p<0.001) and median time to treatment failure (5.0 vs 3.8 months ,  p<0.05) in the irinotecan group .
