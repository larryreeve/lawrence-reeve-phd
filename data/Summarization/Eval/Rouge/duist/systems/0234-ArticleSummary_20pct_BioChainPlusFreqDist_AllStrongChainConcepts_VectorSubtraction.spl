It possesses a broad spectrum of clinical antitumor efficacy and is the most active nonhormonal drug for the treatment of breast cancer .
Its use ,  however ,  is limited by cumulative ,  dose-dependent ,  chronic cardiotoxicity .
More recently ,  however ,  subclinical cardiac injury has been documented at considerably lower doses .
Discontinuation of therapy in these patients may prevent cardiac failure ,  but also results in curtailment of the antineoplastic effect of DOX .
One approach to solving this problem is the development of DOX analogues that retain antineoplastic activity but possess reduced potential for cardiac damage .
Epirubicin (4'-epi-doxorubicin ,  EPI) is one such compound .
The antitumor activity of EPI in animal models is similar to that of DOX ,  but EPI is a less toxic compound with regard to both cytotoxicity and cardiac injury .
The acute toxicity was qualitatively similar to that seen with DOX .
Before an analogue of an active drug is accepted for clinical use ,  its toxicity and efficacy should be compared with that of the established compound .
Blood counts were initially monitored weekly ,  and then less frequently after the pattern of myelosuppression was established .
Biochemical profiles were repeated every six weeks .
All evaluable or measurable parameters of disease were reevaluated at least every six weeks .
Treatment ProtocolEPI was supplied by Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Milan ,  Italy) in a powdered form that was reconstituted with sterile water for injection United States Pharmacopeia .
It was anticipated that these doses would produce equivalent degrees of myelosuppression .
Both resting and ,  when the patient's condition permitted ,  stress RNCA were repeated after the first three doses ,  and after every other dose thereafter .
Therefore ,  for this study laboratory cardiac toxicity was defined as decrease in resting LVEF of > 10% from pretreatment baseline or a decrease in LVEF with stress of > 5% from the resting baseline obtained on the same day .
Several other comparisons ,  such as percent of projected dose ,  used the two-sample Wilcoxon test .
RESULTSPatient CharacteristicsA total of 54 women were randomized ,  25 to the EPI arm and 29 to the DOX arm .
Although all patients had received prior chemotherapy which included cyclophosphamide or other alkylating agent ,  no patient had been previously treated with mitomycin C .
There were seven MRs on the DOX arm and seven patients with stable disease for at least three months .
Noncardiac ToxicityHematologic toxicity was similar in the two arms (Table 3) .
Nausea or vomiting was documented in 58% of patients who received EPI and 67% of the patients who were treated with DOX .
In general ,  the nausea and vomiting in patients on the EPI arm was less severe .
Thus ,  all EPI doses were multiplied by 52/85 to compare the two drugs in equivalent units ,  and Kaplan-Meier estimates plotted (Fig 2B) .
The difference remains statistically significant with a P value of .04 .
Of the ten remaining patients on the EPI arm and elevenpatients on the DOX arm who are not evaluable for laboratory cardiac toxicity because they did not have a second RNCA study ,  the total cumulative doses of EPI and DOX were not significantly different ,  whether or not myelosuppressiveequivalent doses were taken into consideration .
Thus ,  even accounting for the difference in myelosuppressive potency ,  EPI is less cardiotoxic than DOX .
A decrease in LVEF of > 5% with stress was not observed in the absence of a > 10% decrease in resting LVEF from baseline .
DISCUSSIONIn this study ,  EPI had therapeutic activity in breast cancer similar to DOX ,  but produced less cardiotoxicity than the parent compound .
In a prospective adjuvant chemotherapy trial for patients with soft-tissue sarcomas ,  14% of patients who received 430 to 600 mg/m2 of DOX developed clinical CHF .
Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the cardiotoxic effects of DOX .
Although endomyocardial biopsy is probably the definitive measure of cardiac injury ,  RNCA has the advantage of being noninvasive and ,  therefore ,  acceptable to virtually all patients in a randomized study of antineoplastic agents .
Potential selection factors that might bias the comparison of cardiac effects are thereby avoided .
The therapeutic index of an agent is defined by the relationship between the dosage required to produce therapeutic and toxic effects and by the magnitude of the favorable or unfavorable effects observed .
There are three prospective randomized comparison studies that address this issue in patients with breast cancer .
At cumulative EPI doses of 600 to 700 mg/m2 ,  two (13%) of the 15 evaluable patients at risk for RNCA changes developed a decrease in LVEF of > 10% .
In the other single agent study ,  in which there was an empiric dose limitation of 600 mg/m2 ,  none of the seven EPItreated patients who had RNCA experienced a decline in LVEF of > 10% .
In the multidrug study ,  no clinical cardiac dysfunction was seen in the EPI-containing (FEC) arm .
The relatively good cardiac tolerance of EPI observed in the present breast cancer study has been confirmed in our extended phase II experience in other disorders .
This patient had shown a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction and was included in the analysis of laboratory cardiac toxicity .
