INTRODUCTION .
The results of that GOG study were subsequently published in 1990 .
Traditionally ,  women with lymph node metastases have been treated with postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy .
One of them reported favorable results from an uncontrolled trial of adjuvant radiotherapy .
PATIENTS AND METHODS .
Study Design .
In 1993 ,  the sample size goal was increased because of the lower than expected recurrence rate ,  a better estimate of the change in the recurrence rate over time ,  and a small ,  but significant ,  frequency of noncompliance in the radiation therapy (RT) regimen .
Eligibility .
Tumor diameter was estimated by palpation .
Radiation Therapy .
Patients received external beam irradiation and no brachytherapy .
Follow-up Observation .
Quality Control .
Statistical Methods .
Life tables were computed using the method of Kaplan and Meier .
When the characteristic was continuous (e.g. ,  age) the Kruskal–Wallis test was used .
RESULTS .
The distribution of individual risk factors between the treatment regimen was somewhat imbalanced .
There was a disproportionately larger number of patients with positive CLS among the NFT regimen (24% versus 35%) and more patients with .4 cm diameter tumors in the RT regimen (62% versus 54%) .
The site of recurrence was unknown for 2 patients .
Of those who are alive ,  six patients are lost-to-follow-up within the first year in the RT group while one is lost in the NFT group .
The difference between treatment groups remained statistically significant .
DISCUSSION .
Boyce et al. emphasized that a combination of risk factors correlated better with the survival than one factor alone .
Of the three risk factors ,  depth of invasion seems the most objective and accurate method—a direct measurement on the histological slide .
The evaluation of capillary lymphatic space involvement is also subjective .
However ,  the combination of factors proved more accurate than any of the factors alone .
However ,  no such evidence from randomized trials is available about effective treatment of positive lymph nodes .
A significant number of women with Stage IB cervical cancer should benefit from adjuvant pelvic irradiation because 25% of the lymph-node negative patients have high risk factors according to the 1990 GOG data .
The rate of postradiation complications in our study was similar to those reported in the literature .
