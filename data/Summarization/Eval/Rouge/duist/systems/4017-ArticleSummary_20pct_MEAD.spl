Standard therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer is fluorouracil commonly modulated by calcium folinate which typically yields a median survival time of 10-14 months .
Fluorouracil can be used as first-line or second-line therapy and a different regimen of fluorouracil can be administered as second-line treatment if first-line treatment fails .
Quality of life in patients receiving this treatment is generally poor .
Phase III studies of patients whose disease had not responded to first-line fluorouracil or patients whose disease had progressed after first-line fluorouracil treatment showed increased survival times in patients given irinotecan compared with those receiving best supportive care or high-dose fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone by continuous infusion .
Data suggest that the development of well-tolerated regimens that combine irinotecan and high-dose fluorouracil and calcium folinate may be beneficial in the first-line treatment of colorectal cancer .
Phase I dose-escalation studies were done to test combined irinotecan with fluorouracil and calcium folinate weekly or every 2 weeks .
The irinotecan combination and fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone were expected to differ by similar magnitudes in each regimen .
We did a phase III multicentre randomised trial that was designed to assess whether the addition of irinotecan to fluorouracil and calcium folinate would benefit patients previously untreated with chemotherapy other than adjuvant for metastatic colorectal cancer .
We randomly assigned patients irinotecan combined with fluorouracil and calcium folinate irinotecan group or fluorouracil and calcium folinate only no-irinotecan group figure 1. For the noirinotecan group the regimens were: once-weekly fluorouracil 2600 mg/m by 24 h infusion plus calcium folinate 500 mg/m2 n43 or every 2 weeks fluorouracil and calcium folinate at the same doses and administration as in the irinotecan-group 2weekly regimen n143. We needed to include 338 evaluable patients to show a significant difference in response rate between treatment groups assuming response rates of 35 in the no-irinotecan group and 50 in the irinotecan group by use of two-tailed X tests a0.05 power 0.80. Based on the assumption that time to progression would be 6 months in the no-irinotecan group and 9 months in the irinotecan group we calculated that 286 patients were needed to show a significant difference for this variable .
Of the 385 patients treated in the study only 97 25 received treatment by the weekly regimen 54 in the irinotecan group and 43 in the no-irinotecan group .
The other 288 patients received treatment every 2 weeks 145 in the irinotecan group and 143 in the no-irinotecan group .
A higher proportion of women were assigned fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone than the irinotecan regimen and the rectum was the primary tumour site in a higher proportion of patients in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group .
The median duration of treatment was longer in the irinotecan than in the no-irinotecan group irrespective of regimen 24.0 vs 21.0 weeks for the weekly regimen 24.6 vs 18.0 for the 2-weekly regimen .
In the irinotecan group the relative dose intensity was 0.82 for irinotecan and 0.81 for fluorouracil in the weekly regimen and 0.93 and 0.92 respectively in the 2-weekly regimen .
In the no-irinotecan group the relative dose intensity was 0.90 in the weekly regimen and 0.96 in the 2-weekly regimen .
39.4 of patients in the irinotecan group and 58.3 in the no-irinotecan group received further chemotherapy 31.0 of the no-irinotecan group subseqently received irinotecan .
In the did not enable provision of an accurate estimation of the intention-to-treat population response rate was also significantly higher in the irinotecan group than in the noirinotecan group 34.8 28.2-41.9 vs 21.9 16.2-28.5 p0.005 table 2. The median time to onset of response was 8.9 range 4.7-25.4 weeks in the irinotecan group medians.21 The probability of survival in the irinotecan group was 84.9 at 9 months and 75.5 at 12 months and in the no-irinotecan group was 77.3 and 62.7 respectively .
The median duration of response was 9.3 2.8-13.1 months in the irinotecan group and 8.8 3.7-11.8 months in the no-irinotecan group p0.08. The median time to treatment failure was 5.3 0.4-15.7 months in the irinotecan group and 3.8 0.4-11.5 months in the no-irinotecan group p0.0014. The time to definitive deterioration in performance status was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group median 11.2 0.1.15.7 vs 9.9 0.136 months p0.046 figure 4 .
With the 2-weekly regimen diarrhoea was more frequent in the irinotecan group than in the noirinotecan group and the difference was close to siginificance in the weekly regimen .
Among patients receiving the weekly regimen diarrhoea led to hospital admission for 17 31.5 in the irinotecan group and five 11.6 in the no-irinotecan group .
For the 2-weekly regimen 16 11.0 patients in the irinotecan group and two 1.4 in the no-irinotecan group were admitted for diarrhoea .
Asthenia was the second most frequent nonhaematological toxic effect in the irinotecan group and grade 3 or 4 asthenia was significantly more frequent in this group than in the no-irinotecan group for the 2-weekly regimen .
Doses were reduced in 29.6 of patients on the weekly regimen and 18.6 on the 2 weekly regimen in the irinotecan and no-irinotecan groups respectively and in 20.9 and 4.9 on the 2 weekly regimen .
Another phase III study that compared irinotecan combined with bolus fluorouracil and fluorouracil alone consistently provided significantly higher response rates 33 vs 18 p 0.001 and median time to treatment failure 5.0 vs 3.8 months p 0.05 in the irinotecan group .
