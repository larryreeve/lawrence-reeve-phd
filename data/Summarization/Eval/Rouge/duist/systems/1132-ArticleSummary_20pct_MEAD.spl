The incidence is even more pronounced in developing countries where carcinoma of the cervix is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in females with the majority of the patients presenting with advanced disease .
The role of chemotherapy CT either as a single agent or in combination has been extensively evaluated in advanced or recurrent disease .
Response rates ranging from 0 to 90 have been reported but are usually of short duration .
Vogl et al and Alberts et al using a combination of bleomycin vincristine mitomycin and cisplatin BOMP in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent disease reported high response rates 20 of the patients with a complete response CR with acceptable toxicity .
Because of the high remission rate these authors felt this combination should be used as a front-line treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer .
The use of upfront CT as initial treatment before pelvic RT would be theoretically advantageous as the vascular supply to the tumor is not compromised allowing a higher local tissue concentration of drugs thereby improving the effectiveness of CT .
To test this hypothesis we began in 1984 at the Instituto Nacional de Cancer Rio de Janeiro Brazil a prospective randomized trial comparing neoadjuvant BOMP CT followed by pelvic RT CT RT versus pelvic RT alone in patients with stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix .
Between April 1984 and August 1986 107 previously untreated patients with stage III B carcinoma of the cervix were entered on the study .
Eligibility criteria consisted of a histopathologic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma age younger than 70 years with no past history of malignancy the lower third of the vagina free of disease and a performance status greater than 50 in the Karnofsky scale .
Fifty-two patients were randomized to the CT RT arm and 55 to the RT arm .
In the CT RT group 11 refused further therapy including pelvic RT after only one cycle of CT and two others were found to have abnormal renal function after randomization and before commencement of treatment .
Thus there were 39 assessable patients in the CT RT arm and 52 in the RT arm .
Patients in the combined modality group were also assessed for local response at the completion of CT and before the start of RT .
Only supportive palliative treatment was given to relapsing patients and CT was not used as a salvage treatment for the patients in the RT-only arm .
All patients were observed to determine the efficiency of the combined therapy by comparing overall survival rate of local control incidence of distant metastases and toxicity between treatment regimens .
We planned to accrue 60 patients into each treatment arm which would produce a power of 80 and detect an improvement of 25 in survival with the combined modality treatment at the a 0.05 level two-sided test .
The median follow-up time for the RT arm is 51 months range 34 to 67 and is 44 months range 35 to 65 for the CT RT .
For the partial responders 57 in the RT arm and 37.5 in the CT RT are alive with no evidence of disease progression at a minimum follow-up time of 3 years .
These numbers are similar to those patients who were felt to have obtained a CR: only 59 10 of 17 and 40 six of 15 are still alive in the RT and CT RT groups respectively .
As of December 1989 31 of the 52 patients in the RT group and 30 of 39 in the CT RT had died .
It was 39 and 23 for patients randomized to RT and CT RT respectively P .02 by the log-rank test .
Median survivals were 25 months in the RT arm and 10.5 months in the CT RT .
The 5-year survival rates for the complete responders were 57 and 36 for the RT and CT RT groups respectively .
There was also no difference in the incidence of distant disease between RT and CT RT 20 v18.5. Diarrhea was the main complication of pelvic irradiation seen in eight patients 15.5 on RT and 11 34 on CT RT .
Except for two patients all others had received previous treatment CT in two pelvic RT in 11 and major surgery in three .
Since repopulation by surviving tumor clonogens is not a specific response to RT but rather results from killing of tumor cells these authors have suggested that CT which is effective in killing cells could also lead to an accelerated regrowth of surviving clonogens lessening the effect of subsequent RT .
Similarly in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck upfront CT has produced impressive response rates but again this has not led to an improvement in survival rates over those achieved with RT alone .
The lung toxicity experienced by patients in the CT RT group is unacceptable .
Recently Chambers et al also reported a high incidence of pulmonary toxicity in patients receiving BOMP CT for gynecologic squamous cell carcinoma .
These authors treated 23 patients 20 cervical cancer two vulvar one ovarian and observed the development of pulmonary toxicity in eight patients 34.5 with five of them dying a respiratory death while free of disease .
