In 1985 ,  the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG ,  study GI 7175) reported that postoperative radiation and chemotherapy reduced the tumor recurrence rate for patients who had undergone a curative resection for rectal adenocarcinoma .
The same postradiation regimen of 5-FU and MeCCNU as that used in GI 7175 was chosen for one arm ,  with the exception that the duration of treatment with postradiation 5-FU and MeCCNU was reduced from 18 months to 12 months in an attempt to reduce the leukemogenic potential of the MeCCNU .
Patients must have recovered from the acute effects of surgery ,  been capable of starting treatment within 60 days after resection ,  had no evidence of active infection ,  had adequate performance and nutritional status to tolerate protocol treatment ,  and had no preexisting or concurrent malignant tumors except basal cell or superficial squamous cell carcinomas of the skin .
Presence of ascites ,  peritoneal seeding ,  residual pelvic tumor ,  positive paraaortic lymph node biopsy ,  or distant metastases excluded patients from study ,  as did previous chemotherapy or pelvic irradiation or any active and significant coexistent disease that ,  in the judgment of the investigator ,  would make the risks of chemotherapy or radiation therapy prohibitive .
Normal hepatic ,  renal ,  and bone marrow function (ie ,  bilirubin level < 2.5 mg/dL ,  BUN level< 25 mg/dL ,  or creatinine level < 1.5 mg/dL ,  leukocyte and platelet counts > 4,500/uL and 125,000/uL ,  respectively) must have been documented before study entry .
The inferior margin included the perineumin all patients who underwent an abdominal-perineal resection and whose tumor was <= 5 cm from the dentate line .
Second and subsequent courses were to be given on the same schedule but with the dose of 5-FU increased to 325 mg/m intravenously ,  days 1 to 5,375 mg/m2 ,  days 36 to 40 ,  and MeCCNU to 130 mg/m orally on day 1 .
During postradiotherapy chemotherapy ,  moderate or severe nausea or vomiting required a 50% dose reduction of all chemotherapy for one course ,  mild stomatitis or diarrhea ,  continued but not escalated therapy ,  and moderate or worse stomatitis ,  reduction of the next course of chemotherapy by 25% .
Dose reduction criteria for the 5-FU escalating arm included no escalation if leukocyte count nadir was below 2,000/UL but at least 1,000/UL and platelet count nadir between 75,000/UL and 99,999/UL and a 25% reduction in the next course for leukocyte nadir below 1,000/UL and platelet count nadir below 75,000/UL .
Central review of radiotherapy treatment records including contour and isodose curves ,  dosimetry calculations ,  simulation films ,  verification films for each port displaying treatment fields ,  and dose prescription was conducted by Dr P.R.M .
Disease recurrence required histologic or cytologic documentation with the exception that radiographic techniques could be used to establish the presence of metastases to the lung ,  liver ,  bony structures ,  or brain .
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an adjuvant treatment with radiation therapy and escalating 5-FU and to compare it with a combination of 5-FU and MeCCNU .
The contribution of variables and treatment effect was tested using the proportional hazards procedures of Cox and the log-rank test .
Reasons for ineligibility were as follows ,  colon cancer rather than rectal cancer (five patients) ,  prior history of cancer (two) ,  and incomplete resection (four) .
Selected patient characteristics show that 58% had disease extension involving the perirectal fat with at least one positive lymph node ,  60% of patients are male ,  and 59% underwent an abdominal-perineal resection (Table 1) .
The median follow-up time for the 108 surviving patients is 5.8 years with 3 years of follow-up available for all but five surviving patients .
As planned in the protocol design ,  patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm were treated for a longer duration than patients who received escalating 5-FU (median ,  11.3 months v 7.5 months ,  respectively) .
Leukocyte depression below 1,000/UL accounted for a majority of these episodes (eight patients on the escalating 5-FU arm and three on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm) .
Toxicity resulted in either a temporary or permanent decrease in dose ,  interruption of part of therapy ,  or interruption of all therapy in 62% of 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 53% of escalating 5-FU patients .
Two treatment-related deaths were reported ,  one on each treatment arm .
Twelve days after treatment initiation and after receiving the initial 3 days of 5-FU and 4 days of radiation therapy ,  he experienced life-threatening episodes of myelosuppression ,  stomatitis ,  and seizures .
The prognostic importance of Dukes stage ,  resection type ,  distance to the nearest margin ,  age ,  sex ,  and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score on disease-free survival was examined in the cohort of eligible patients .
As in the disease-free analysis ,  secondary analyses of survival considering either all patients randomized or only patients who received treatment after the completion of radiation therapy ,  resulted in no meaningful change in direction or magnitude of the RR attributed to treatment with the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen (RR = 1.10 ,  95% CI ,  .72 to 1.67 ,  and RR = 1.04 ,  95% CI ,  .65 to 1.67 ,  respectively) .
Both survival and disease-free survival results favor the escalating 5-FU arm ,  although these differences did not reach statistical significance .
Fewer recurrences involving distant sites occurred on the escalating 5-FU arm compared with the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm ,  further suggesting that MeCCNU is not an essential component of the postradiation chemotherapy treatment .
The results of the present study confirm the expected survival and disease-free survival probabilities observed in the combination therapy arm of the previous GITSG study ,  while the recent report by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) further demonstrates the advantage of combination radiation therapy and chemotherapy compared with radiation therapy alone in reducing recurrence rates and improving survival .
Although data from the initial rectal cancer adjuvant trial conducted by the National Surgical Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP RO1) suggested improved survival and disease-free survival in patients treated with chemotherapy alone compared with surgery alone ,  that study did not include a combined modality treatment arm .
A recent National Institutes of Health consensus conference on adjuvant therapy for patients with colon and rectal cancer concluded that combined postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy improved local control and survival in stage B2 and C patients with rectal cancer and that treatment with combined modality therapy in these patients is recommended .
