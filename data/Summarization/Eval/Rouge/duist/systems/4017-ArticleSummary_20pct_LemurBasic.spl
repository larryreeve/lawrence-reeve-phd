phase iii studies of patients whose disease had not responded to first line fluorouracil or patients whose disease had progressed after first line fluorouracil treatment showed increased survival times in patients given irinotecan compared with those receiving best supportive care or high dose fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone by continuous infusion 
we did a phase iii multicentre randomised trial that was designed to assess whether the addition of irinotecan to fluorouracil and calcium folinate would benefit patients previously untreated with chemotherapy other than adjuvant for metastatic colorectal cancer 
from may 1997 to february 1998 we enrolled patients who met the following eligibility criteria histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum age 18 75 years who performance status of 2 or less and life expectancy of more than 3 months haemoglobin 100 g l or more absolute neutrophil count 2 0 10 l platelets 150 10 l or more creatinine 1 25 or less times the upper limit of normal total bilirubin 1 25 or less times the upper limit of normal aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 3 0 or less times the upper limit of normal if liver metastases present 1 5 or less times for bilirubin and 5 0 or less times for aspartate and alanine aminotransferases and no previous other than adjuvant chemotherapy finished more than 6 months before randomisation 
patients with the following criteria were not eligible central nervous system metastasis unresolved bowel obstruction or diarrhoea and known contraindications to fluorouracil angina pectoris myocardial infarction in the past 6 months 
before the start of the study each investigator chose one of two proposed regimens for fluorouracil and calcium folinate according to local clinical practice or preference de gramont every 2 weeks or arbeitsgemeinschaft internische onkologie cooperative german group for oncology once weekly 
for the irinotecan group the regimens were once weekly irinotecan 80 mg m with fluorouracil 2300 mg m by 24 h infusion plus calcium folinate 500 mg m n 54 or every 2 weeks irinotecan 180 mg m on day 1 with fluorouracil 400 mg m bolus and 600 mg m by 22 h infusion plus calcium folinate 200 mg m on days 1 and 2 n 145 
for the noirinotecan group the regimens were once weekly fluorouracil 2600 mg m by 24 h infusion plus calcium folinate 500 mg m2 n 43 or every 2 weeks fluorouracil and calcium folinate at the same doses and administration as in the irinotecan group 2weekly regimen n 143 
we needed to include 338 evaluable patients to show a significant difference in response rate between treatment groups assuming response rates of 35 in the no irinotecan group and 50 in the irinotecan group by use of two tailed x tests a 0 05 power 0 80 
based on the assumption that time to progression would be 6 months in the no irinotecan group and 9 months in the irinotecan group we calculated that 286 patients were needed to show a significant difference for this variable 
for analysis by two tailed log rank test a 0 05 power of 0 80 with the assumption that accrual and minimum follow up would last for 6 months and 9 months respectively we had to include 143 patients in each treatment group 
the first group included countries that had recruited more than 30 patients uk spain france czech republic germany and austria the second countries that had recruited 10 30 patients belgium israel south africa switzerland and italy and the third countries that had recruited fewer than ten patients greece portugal and the netherlands 
we tested the nine following variables sex who performance status 2 and 2 weight loss 5 and 5 number of organs involved 3 and 3 primary tumour site colon or rectum organ involvement liver only or other sites time from first diagnosis to first metastasis 0 3 3 12 12 months previous surgery and previous adjuvant therapy 
for time to progression cox s proportional hazards modelling was used with the following variables sex age 58 and 58 years who performance status 2 and 2 weight loss 5 and 5 number of organs involved 3 and 3 primary tumour site colon or rectum liver involvement lymph node involvement time from first diagnosis to first metastasis 0 3 3 12 12 months previous surgery previous adjuvant therapy time from first diagnosis and first infusion 9 and 9 months 
a higher proportion of women were assigned fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone than the irinotecan regimen and the rectum was the primary tumour site in a higher proportion of patients in the irinotecan group than in the no irinotecan group 
the median duration of treatment was longer in the irinotecan than in the no irinotecan group irrespective of regimen 24 0 vs 21 0 weeks for the weekly regimen 24 6 vs 18 0 for the 2 weekly regimen 
in the irinotecan group the relative dose intensity was 0 82 for irinotecan and 0 81 for fluorouracil in the weekly regimen and 0 93 and 0 92 respectively in the 2 weekly regimen

the median time to onset of response was 8 9 range 4 7 25 4 weeks in the irinotecan group medians 21 the probability of survival in the irinotecan group was 84 9 at 9 months and 75 5 at 12 months and in the no irinotecan group was 77 3 and 62 7 respectively

there was insufficient power to compare the efficacy risk of progression for a patient in the no irinotecan group was increased by about 69 compared with that for a patient in the irinotecan group when all other variables were equal 
the time to definitive deterioration in performance status was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the no irinotecan group median 11 2 0 1 15 7 vs 9 9 0 13 6 months p 0 046 figure 4 
in the irinotecan group admission was required for fever in the absence of infection with concomitant grade 3 or 4 neutropenia for five 9 3 patients on the weekly regimen and one 0 7 on the 2 weekly regimen for the no irinotecan group admission was required for one 2 3 patient on the weekly regimen and none on the 2 weekly regimen 
asthenia was the second most frequent nonhaematological toxic effect in the irinotecan group and grade 3 or 4 asthenia was significantly more frequent in this group than in the no irinotecan group for the 2 weekly regimen 
doses were reduced in 29 6 of patients on the weekly regimen and 18 6 on the 2 weekly regimen in the irinotecan and no irinotecan groups respectively and in 20 9 and 4 9 on the 2 weekly regimen 
one patient treated with the irinotecan combination on the 2 weekly regimen did not receive appropriate therapy for the management of diarrhoea and died early in the first cycle probably because of septic shock concomitant with grade 4 neutropenia 
definitive deterioration in quality of life occurred consistently later in the irinotecan group for a deterioration from baseline by 5 p 0 03 10 p 0 06 20 p 0 04 and 30 p 0 06 
this study population was large 385 patients treated and the patients were representative of candidates for first line chemotherapy in clinical practice except that an unexpectedly high proportion of them had synchronous metastases at baseline and consequently a relatively low proportion of them had had previous adjuvant chemotherapy 
another phase iii study that compared irinotecan combined with bolus fluorouracil and fluorouracil alone consistently provided significantly higher response rates 33 vs 18 p 0 001 and median time to treatment failure 5 0 vs 3 8 months p 0 05 in the irinotecan group 
the results we achieved with the irinotecan combination treatment show that the addition of irinotecan to weekly or 2 weekly regimens of fluorouracil and calcium folinate by infusion brings clear clinical benefit and should be considered as a first line reference treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer as well as for advanced disease
