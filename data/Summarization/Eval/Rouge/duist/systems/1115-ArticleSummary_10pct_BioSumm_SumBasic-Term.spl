An analysis of the patterns of failure after radiation therapy in locally advanced cervical cancer reveals that of those who recur over 70% have some component of pelvic failure as the first site of relapse and two-thirds develop some component of distant disease .
These advantages include no delay in the start of definitive irradiation ,  no prolongation of overall treatment time (thus minimizing the theoretical risk of accelerated clonogen proliferation during the antineoplastic course) ,  and possible interaction of the concurrently administered chemotherapy with radiation through such mechanisms as inhibition of repair of radiation damage ,  cell synchronization ,  recruitment of nonproliferating cells into cell cycle ,  and reduction of the hypoxic fraction .
The optimal dosing schedule for maximizing cell kill with infusional 5-FU and radiation remains undefined ,  but laboratory data suggested greater effects with increasing dose and prolonged exposure to 5-FU and when drug was present for intervals in excess of 48 h after radiation .
A screening chest X-ray was to be negative for metastases and if lymphography or abdominal CT scanning was performed ,  there should be no apparent evidence of involvement of the para-aortic nodes .
Patients were randomized to receive either (a) standard external beam pelvic irradiation (EBRT) in a dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions defined at 100% versus ,  (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional intravenous 5-FU in a dose of 1 g/m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  (c) partially hyperfractionated RT ,  5280 cGy in 33 fractions ,  2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  or (d) arm (c) with the same infusional 5-FU .
The superior border of the radiation treatment volume was the L5/S1 junction ,  the inferior ,  the bottom of the obdurator foramina ,  or 2 cm below the lowest identified extent of vaginal disease .
For rare patients with disease extension to the lower one-third of vagina ,  the first application to the cervix and uterus was modified to deliver 30 Gy at 2 cm from the center of the sources and a second application as a line source in the vagina ,  was used to deliver a further 20 Gy at 0.5 cm depth from the surface of the vagina. 5-FU was given as an infusion from days 1 to 4 inclusive and on treatment days 22 to 25 inclusive .
The outcomes of interest in this study were pelvic control ,  survival ,  and disease-free survival ,  as well as the serious late complication rate .
Assuming that the magnitude and direction of the 5-FU effects were similar in arms (b) and (d) then the effect of the addition of 5-FU could be tested by comparing arms (b) and (d) with arms (a) and (c) .
Additionally ,  the changed fractionation scheme with delivery of two fractions daily at the beginning and end of therapy was designed to maximize the potential for interaction between 5-FU and radiation and to potentially reduce complication rates .
In order to detect a 20% improvement in pelvic control rate from an expected 50% for arm (a) to 70% for arm (d) assuming an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.20 ,  73 patients in each of four treatment arms would be required for a total of 292 patients .
The median tumor size in stratum 1 of 6 cm was large despite the relatively earlier FIGO stage compared to stratum 2 .
One hundred and ninety of 221 patients received external beam radiation using the box technique ,  while 31 were treated with a parallel pair .
However ,  in evaluating the importance of the contribution of the change in fractionation to the differences observed ,  there was no significant difference in the 5-year survival of those treated on standard radiation versus those treated with hyperfractionated irradiation whether or not 5-FU was used .
Since significant differences in pelvic control and survival were observed in stratum 1 which contained only 99 patients ,  it is important to examine whether there was an uneven distribution of other possible patient or tumor-related prognostic factors across the treatment arms to account for the differences observed .
The crude incidence of 5.9% (13 of 221) presents a good estimate of the overall risk for chronic bowel complications in survivors ,  since most occur in the first 3 years after radiation therapy .
To reach the conclusion that concurrent chemotherapy truly adds benefit to results achievable with radiation alone ,  it is important that the radiation be delivered in an optimal manner with adequate doses at ‘‘Point A’’ (80 to 90 Gy) and limited overall treatment times .
The specific strata selected were based on previous retrospective data indicating significantly different prognoses for these specific clinical groupings of bulk of pelvic disease .
However ,  in stratum 1 constituted of patients with stage IB/IIA and those IIB tumors with medial parametrial involvement ,  a significant improvement in both pelvic control and disease-free survival in favor of standard radiation with concurrent 5-FU was observed (Figs. 5 and 6) .
The tumor- and patient-related factors examined were FIGO stage (IB versus IIA versus IIB) ,  size of tumor (greater or less than 6 cm and greater or less than 7 cm) ,  grade of tumor the presence or absence of capillary-like space involvement ,  nodal involvement ,  and patient age as a continuous variable .
The changed fractionation scheme ,  using smaller than conventional fraction sizes and a 6% increase in total dose was designed to be approximately biologically equivalent for tumor control to that of standard radiation yet lead to reduced complications .
