A two-arm study was designed using the initial radiation/chemotherapy program of the previous study (GI 7175) for both arms of the new study (GI 7180) but to offering MeCCNU to only half the patients during the postradiation period .
Patients must have recovered from the acute effects of surgery ,  been capable of starting treatment within 60 days after resection ,  had no evidence of active infection ,  had adequate performance and nutritional status to tolerate protocol treatment ,  and had no preexisting or concurrent malignant tumors except basal cell or superficial squamous cell carcinomas of the skin .
Presence of ascites ,  peritoneal seeding ,  residual pelvic tumor ,  positive paraaortic lymph node biopsy ,  or distant metastases excluded patients from study ,  as did previous chemotherapy or pelvic irradiation or any active and significant coexistent disease that ,  in the judgment of the investigator ,  would make the risks of chemotherapy or radiation therapy prohibitive .
Only patients with Dukes pathologic stage B2 (negative nodes ,  disease extension into the perirectal fat) ,  C1 (positive nodes ,  no disease extension into the perirectal fat) ,  and C2 ,  (positive nodes ,  disease extension into the perirectal fat) were eligible ,  and slides must have been available for review .
The inferior margin included the perineumin all patients who underwent an abdominal-perineal resection and whose tumor was <= 5 cm from the dentate line .
During postradiotherapy chemotherapy ,  moderate or severe nausea or vomiting required a 50% dose reduction of all chemotherapy for one course ,  mild stomatitis or diarrhea ,  continued but not escalated therapy ,  and moderate or worse stomatitis ,  reduction of the next course of chemotherapy by 25% .
Dose reductions of 5-FU by 25% were required for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU treatment arm who experienced a leukocyte count nadir of below 2,000/UL during the first 3 weeks .
Reasons for ineligibility were as follows ,  colon cancer rather than rectal cancer (five patients) ,  prior history of cancer (two) ,  and incomplete resection (four) .
The remaining 199 patients (95% of the registered population) are included for survival analysis in the study group to which they were randomized regardless of whether or not protocol treatment was administered .
Four patients received no protocol treatment and are excluded from the toxicity analyses but are included in the survival and disease-free survival analyses .
Although the protocol required treatment to begin within 60 days of surgery ,  20 patients evenly distributed between the two treatment arms began treatment more than 60 days postsurgery ,  16 of the 20 individuals received their initial therapy within 64 days .
Two patients on each treatment arm received no adjuvant therapy ,  and 16 patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and 18 patients assigned to the escalating 5-FU regimen received no postradiation chemotherapy .
An additional three patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm received no MeCCNU after radiation therapy but continued to receive 5-FU .
As planned in the protocol design ,  patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm were treated for a longer duration than patients who received escalating 5-FU (median ,  11.3 months v 7.5 months ,  respectively) .
Also as planned ,  among patients who received chemotherapy ,  dose intensity of 5-FU was greater on the escalating 5-FU arm versus the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm .
Although patients received a median total dose of 12.4 g/m of 5-FU on the escalating 5-FU arm (25% < the planned level of 16.5g/m) and 13.1 g/m of 5-FU on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm (23% < the planned level of 16.9 g/m) ,  the median monthly dose of 5-FU on the escalating arm was 1.74g/m ,  compared with 1.40 g/m on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm (P < .001) .
Patients randomized to 5-FU and MeCCNU received a median total dose of MeCCNU of.37 g/m2 (25% < the planned level of .49 g/m) ,  and a median of .08 g/m of MeCCNU per 10-week course .
Life-threatening toxicities were reported in six (6%) 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 11 (10%) escalating 5-FU patients .
Leukocyte depression below 1,000/UL accounted for a majority of these episodes (eight patients on the escalating 5-FU arm and three on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm) .
Toxicity resulted in either a temporary or permanent decrease in dose ,  interruption of part of therapy ,  or interruption of all therapy in 62% of 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 53% of escalating 5-FU patients .
One patient on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm is reported to have died of complications of intestinal obstruction ,  although confirming evidence documenting this event is not available .
Six patients are reported to have experienced severe (three) or life-threatening (three) treatment-related intestinal obstructions ,  two receiving the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen and four on escalating 5-FU (Table 2) .
Recurrences involving local sites occurred in 17% of 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 16% of escalating 5-FU patients .
The probability of 3-year disease-free survival on the two arms is 54% and 68% for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and the escalating 5-FU arm ,  respectively ,  median time to recurrenceis estimated to be 4 years and greater than 4 years ,  respectively (Fig 1) .
Similarly ,  when only eligible patients who received post-radiation therapy drug treatment were considered (84 escalating 5-FU and 72 5-FU and MeCCNU patients) ,  no difference in direction or magnitude of the RR estimate was observed (RR = 1.17 ,  95% CI ,  .74 to 1.85) .
Eighty-one of the deaths were attributed to progressive disease ,  and one death was reported without documented cause ,  the causes of death for the remaining nine patients were attributed to treatment (two patients ,  discussed above) ,  myocardial infarctions (five , three of whom had a suspected recurrence) ,  stroke (one) ,  and metastatic disease resulting from a new primary tumor arising in the bile duct (one) .
Median survival has not been reached in either treatment arm .
Figure 3 compares the survival prognosis of patients undergoing abdominal-perineal resections and patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to margin of resection (as determined by the pathologist on fresh specimen) of <= 3 cm and greater than 3 cm. Patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to the margin greater than 3 cm experienced improved survival compared with patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to the nearest margin <= 3 cm ,  suggesting that abdominal-perineal resection should be considered when the distal margin for resection with the low anterior route would be <= 3 cm .
As in the disease-free analysis ,  secondary analyses of survival considering either all patients randomized or only patients who received treatment after the completion of radiation therapy ,  resulted in no meaningful change in direction or magnitude of the RR attributed to treatment with the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen (RR = 1.10 ,  95% CI ,  .72 to 1.67 ,  and RR = 1.04 ,  95% CI ,  .65 to 1.67 ,  respectively) .
There were no differences between the radiation and escalating 5-FU arm of GI7180 and the radiation and 5-FU and MeCCNU arm of GI 7175 with respect to survival within any stage (Fig 4) .
The results of this study indicate that treatment after surgical resection of Dukes B2 and C rectal cancer with escalating 5-FU postradiation therapy provides similar survival and recurrence outcomes as a postradiation chemotherapeutic regimen including the leukemogen MeCCNU .
Both survival and disease-free survival results favor the escalating 5-FU arm ,  although these differences did not reach statistical significance .
Fewer recurrences involving distant sites occurred on the escalating 5-FU arm compared with the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm ,  further suggesting that MeCCNU is not an essential component of the postradiation chemotherapy treatment .
Because of toxicity ,  patients often received no therapy beyond the initial radiation treatment .
The results of the present study confirm the expected survival and disease-free survival probabilities observed in the combination therapy arm of the previous GITSG study ,  while the recent report by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) further demonstrates the advantage of combination radiation therapy and chemotherapy compared with radiation therapy alone in reducing recurrence rates and improving survival .
Although data from the initial rectal cancer adjuvant trial conducted by the National Surgical Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP RO1) suggested improved survival and disease-free survival in patients treated with chemotherapy alone compared with surgery alone ,  that study did not include a combined modality treatment arm .
A recent National Institutes of Health consensus conference on adjuvant therapy for patients with colon and rectal cancer concluded that combined postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy improved local control and survival in stage B2 and C patients with rectal cancer and that treatment with combined modality therapy in these patients is recommended .
