More evidence has emerged lately ,  however ,  that adjuvant chemotherapy of colon cancer may be beneficial .
Based on these results ,  several prospective randomised comparisons of intraportal infusion of various regimens after surgery and surgery alone were initiated .
Between July ,  1981 ,  and March ,  1987 ,  we enrolled 533 patients with adenocarcinoma of colon or rectum who were about to undergo curative resection and were younger than 75 years .
To be eligible ,  patients had to have no evidence of metastatic disease in preoperative investigations. 29 patients had liver metastases diagnosed at resection and 8 had incomplete resection .
The 37 patients who had metastases diagnosed at surgery or had incomplete resection were regarded as having relapsed on the day of surgery. 5 patients were lost to follow-up .
All probability values were two-sided .
Among the patients assigned chemotherapy ,  69.4% received at least 80% of the prescribed dose of fluorouracil ,  75-1% received at least 50% ,  and 78-4% at least 25% .
In 41 patients (17-4%) treatment was assigned but not given because of surgery-related problems (7) ,  difficulties with catheter placement (7) ,  other technical problems (14) ,  patient refusal (2) ,  and various other reasons (11) .
Results .
Treatment outcome was similar in all subgroups ,  and was best in that with positive nodes .
The infusion group had a higher rate of repeat laparotomy and haemorrhage than the control group ,  especially after abdominoperineal resection of rectal cancer .
These abnormalities had resolved at the first follow-up examination .
This trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase survival in patients with colorectal cancer .
Adjuvant chemotherapy reduced the risk of recurrence by 21 % and the risk of death by 26% .
This effect was observed in all subgroups ,  but was greatest in patients with tumour-involved lymph nodes (33%) and in those with colon cancer (22%) .
The adjuvant treatment was given as a continuous infusion for 5-7 days immediately after operation .
For further studies ,  we recommend that patients with insulin-dependent diabetes ,  a high risk of postoperative complications (obesity ,  cardiac ,  and/or pulmonary disease) ,  or any evidence of intra-abdominal sepsis at laparotomy or during the early postoperative period ,  should be excluded from participation .
This low incidence of surgical complications suggests advances in surgical technique and in patient management before and after elective cancer surgery ,  that allow safe use of adjuvant chemotherapy soon after surgical intervention .
Based on previous results and our own findings ,  the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research decided to accept perioperative adjuvant chemotherapy as the standard treatment for further clinical trials in colorectal cancer .
