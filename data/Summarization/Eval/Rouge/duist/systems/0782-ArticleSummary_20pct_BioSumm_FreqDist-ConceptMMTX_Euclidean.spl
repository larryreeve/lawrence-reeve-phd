Introduction .
Adjuvant chemotherapy of colorectal cancer has been tested in several randomised trials .
Liver metastases are observed at diagnosis of primary colorectal cancer in 25-30% of patients .
Overt liver metastases seem to be the first site of relapse for 40-50%of patients with operable disease .
Intraportal injection of cytotoxic agents at the time of surgery for colorectal cancer was advocated in 1957 to prevent liver metastases .
Interest in this treatment was stimulated by the promising findings of a 1979 randomised study .
The initial response rate was 83% .
We report long-term results here .
Access to the portal vein was through any side branch of the mesenteric venous system .
All probability values were two-sided .
Later the curves come closer together .
Treatment outcome was similar in all subgroups ,  and was best in that with positive nodes .
These abnormalities had resolved at the first follow-up examination .
Discussion .
This trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase survival in patients with colorectal cancer .
We know of at least twelve prospective controlled studies with a similar design .
In two trials intraportal treatment was compared with systemic cytotoxic drugs .
We have investigated this hypothesis in a second clinical trial .
This low incidence of surgical complications suggests advances in surgical technique and in patient management before and after elective cancer surgery ,  that allow safe use of adjuvant chemotherapy soon after surgical intervention .
