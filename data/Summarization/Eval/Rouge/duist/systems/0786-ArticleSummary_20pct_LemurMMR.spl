furthermore studies in metastatic colorectal disease demonstrating enhanced efficacy of 5 fu when administered with leucovorin as well as a recent report indicating a reduction in the rate of recurrence in colon cancer when levamisole was added to adjuvant 5 fu have led to an intergroup trial assessing the value of such combinations as adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer intergroup rectal adjuvant protocol int 0114 activated august 1990 
the results of the present study confirm the expected survival and disease free survival probabilities observed in the combination therapy arm of the previous gitsg study while the recent report by the north central cancer treatment group ncctg further demonstrates the advantage of combination radiation therapy and chemotherapy compared with radiation therapy alone in reducing recurrence rates and improving survival 
although patients received a median total dose of 12 4 g m of 5 fu on the escalating 5 fu arm 25 the planned level of 16 5g m and 13 1 g m of 5 fu on the 5 fu and meccnu arm 23 the planned level of 16 9 g m the median monthly dose of 5 fu on the escalating arm was 1 74g m compared with 1 40 g m on the 5 fu and meccnu arm p 001 
recurrence of rectal cancer in the pelvis after a complete resection represents a major contributor to morbidity and subsequent mortality 
as in the disease free analysis secondary analyses of survival considering either all patients randomized or only patients who received treatment after the completion of radiation therapy resulted in no meaningful change in direction or magnitude of the rr attributed to treatment with the 5 fu and meccnu regimen rr 1 10 95 ci 72 to 1 67 and rr 1 04 95 ci 65 to 1 67 respectively 
the superior border of the field was to be the top of the fifth lumbar vertebral body the lateral border 2 cm lateral to the true pelvic side wall and the inferior margin of the field was to be determined clinically 
eighty one of the deaths were attributed to progressive disease and one death was reported without documented cause the causes of death for the remaining nine patients were attributed to treatment two patients discussed above myocardial infarctions five three of whom had a suspected recurrence stroke one and metastatic disease resulting from a new primary tumor arising in the bile duct one 
a stage wise comparison of the results of this study with gi 7175 in which the same staging criteria of gi 7175 were applied to gi 7180 shows that reducing the chemotherapeutic regimen of 5 fu and meccnu from 18 months to 12 months did not significantly alter the survival outcome for patients 
the same postradiation regimen of 5 fu and meccnu as that used in gi 7175 was chosen for one arm with the exception that the duration of treatment with postradiation 5 fu and meccnu was reduced from 18 months to 12 months in an attempt to reduce the leukemogenic potential of the meccnu 
although the superiority of combination radiotherapy and chemotherapy with fluorouracil 5 fu and semustine meccnu was clearly shown in terms of both disease free survival and subsequently overall survival the clinical impact of such treatment was tempered by the inclusion of meccnu in an adjuvant setting 
the results of this study indicate that treatment after surgical resection of dukes b2 and c rectal cancer with escalating 5 fu postradiation therapy provides similar survival and recurrence outcomes as a postradiation chemotherapeutic regimen including the leukemogen meccnu 
figure 3 compares the survival prognosis of patients undergoing abdominal perineal resections and patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to margin of resection as determined by the pathologist on fresh specimen of 3 cm and greater than 3 cm patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to the margin greater than 3 cm experienced improved survival compared with patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to the nearest margin 3 cm suggesting that abdominal perineal resection should be considered when the distal margin for resection with the low anterior route would be 3 cm 
the original design called for the enrollment of 134 patients per arm and the primary end point was to detect a difference in the 30 month disease free survival rate from 65 for the meccnu containing arm to 80 for the escalating 5 fu arm 
toxicity resulted in either a temporary or permanent decrease in dose interruption of part of therapy or interruption of all therapy in 62 of 5 fu and meccnu patients and 53 of escalating 5 fu patients 
patients considered eligible received a full explanation of the purpose procedures and risks of the study signed a statement of informed consent approved by the local institutional review board and were then randomized by telephoning a central coordinating center 
toxicities experienced by patients on the two arms are comparable 53 of patients on the 5 fu and meccnuarm 52 of 99 and 50 of those assigned to the escalating 5 fu arm 54 of 107 experienced at least one episode of severe or worse toxicity as defined by the gitsg toxicity scale 
a two arm study was designed using the initial radiation chemotherapy program of the previous study gi 7175 for both arms of the new study gi 7180 but to offering meccnu to only half the patients during the postradiation period 
patients randomized to 5 fu and meccnu received a median total dose of meccnu of 37 g m2 25 the planned level of 49 g m and a median of 08 g m of meccnu per 10 week course 
despite early termination of accrual due to loss of funding the results of this study provide important information regarding the potential effectiveness of the escalating 5 fu regimen compared with a meccnu containing regimen 
in cases of perineal exclusion the inferior margin of the field must have included the lower margin of the ischial tuberosity 
using the techniques of makuch and simon it can be shown that a sample size of 100 patients per arm has an 80 power to exclude differences in treatments as great as 19 assuming a 05 and a 30 month rate of 65 
a recent national institutes of health consensus conference on adjuvant therapy for patients with colon and rectal cancer concluded that combined postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy improved local control and survival in stage b2 and c patients with rectal cancer and that treatment with combined modality therapy in these patients is recommended 
for all other patients inclusion of the perineum in the radiation field was at the discretion of the investigator 
perineal pain if preceded by a pain free interval was considered indicative of recurrence and time of recurrence was listed as the time of pain onset 
the distal edge of the primary tumor must have been 12 cm from the anal verge as measured by sigmoidoscopy with the patient in the knee chest position 
patients must have recovered from the acute effects of surgery been capable of starting treatment within 60 days after resection had no evidence of active infection had adequate performance and nutritional status to tolerate protocol treatment and had no preexisting or concurrent malignant tumors except basal cell or superficial squamous cell carcinomas of the skin 
presence of ascites peritoneal seeding residual pelvic tumor positive paraaortic lymph node biopsy or distant metastases excluded patients from study as did previous chemotherapy or pelvic irradiation or any active and significant coexistent disease that in the judgment of the investigator would make the risks of chemotherapy or radiation therapy prohibitive 
results from the previous gitsg study gi 7175 of adjuvant therapy after surgical resection of dukes b2 or c rectal cancer demonstrated improved survival and disease free survival in patients treated with combination radiation therapy and post radiation therapy using 5 fu and meccnu when compared with surgery alone and improved disease free survival for patients treated with this combined modality therapy compared with radiation therapy alone 
the potential for meccnu to contribute to a result superior to that obtained with escalating 5 fu can be assessed by examining the lower bound of the 95 confidence intervals of relative risk 
the remaining 199 patients 95 of the registered population are included for survival analysis in the study group to which they were randomized regardless of whether or not protocol treatment was administered 
twelve days after treatment initiation and after receiving the initial 3 days of 5 fu and 4 days of radiation therapy he experienced life threatening episodes of myelosuppression stomatitis and seizures 
patients were considered eligible for entry onto the study provided they had histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum and had undergone a surgical procedure at which time all gross tumor had been removed and no evidence of tumor had been present at the resection margins 
an escalating single agent 5 fu regimen incorporating a theoretical maximum tolerated dose was chosen as the alternative treatment option based on clinical evidence suggesting a dose response curve for 5 fu and pilot data from the dana farber cancer institute suggesting added efficacy of 5 fu when given at higher dose levels 
the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an adjuvant treatment with radiation therapy and escalating 5 fu and to compare it with a combination of 5 fu and meccnu 
in 1985 the gastrointestinal tumor study group gitsg study gi 7175 reported that postoperative radiation and chemotherapy reduced the tumor recurrence rate for patients who had undergone a curative resection for rectal adenocarcinoma 
when included in the cox model dukes stage resection type distance to the nearest margin 3 cm v other and the interaction between resection type and distance to the nearest margin were found to be significant without adjustment for multiple comparisons in predicting disease free survival p 05 
although data from the initial rectal cancer adjuvant trial conducted by the national surgical breast and bowel project nsabp ro1 suggested improved survival and disease free survival in patients treated with chemotherapy alone compared with surgery alone that study did not include a combined modality treatment arm
