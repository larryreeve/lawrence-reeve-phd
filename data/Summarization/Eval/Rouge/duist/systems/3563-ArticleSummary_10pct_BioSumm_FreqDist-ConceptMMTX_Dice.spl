Of these ,  the method that has proven successful in most situations and in the hands of most surgeons has been the two-layer anastomosis using interrupted silk sutures for an outer inverted seromuscular layer and a running absorbable suture for a transmural inner layer .
Recently ,  several reports have appeared advocating a single-layer continuous anastomosis using monofilament plastic suture .
All single-layer anastomoses were constructed using a continuous 3.0 polypropylene double-needle suture that began at the mesenteric border (Fig. 1) .
The two-layer interrupted anastomosis has its origins in the early 19th century through the experimental work of Travers and of Lembert ,  who advocated careful approximation of the serosal surfaces of the bowel and devised a method of suturing to accomplish this .
Other traditional risk factors such as diabetes ,  steroids ,  anastomotic method ,  blood loss ,  and nutritional factors have not clearly been predictive of anastomotic failure .
Numerous studies in the literature comparing techniques (e.g. ,  one-layer vs. two-layer ,  hand-sewn vs. stapled ,  and end-to-end vs. end-to-side) have failed to demonstrate a clear superiority of one over another .
The senior authors of this paper (J.M.B. ,  E.E.M.) have used the single-layer technique exclusively for many years and can routinely perform an anastomosis in 8 to 10 minutes .
Although it did not quite reach statistical significance ,  it may be related to an intrinsic difference between the two methods ,  the single-layer anastomosis always has a larger lumen .
Although it is certainly possible to create an ischemic continuous anastomosis by applying too much tension while following the suture ,  Hautefeuille has argued that this is easier to avoid with a continuous suture because there is no point in the anastomosis where the bowel is completely devoid of its blood supply .
Bailey et al have speculated that the continuous single-layer suture ,  which resembles a circular coiled spring ,  may be able to expand and contract depending on intraluminal forces .
