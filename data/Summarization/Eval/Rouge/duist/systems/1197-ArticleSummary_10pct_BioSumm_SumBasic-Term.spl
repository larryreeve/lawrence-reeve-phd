Stratification was by primary versus recurrent tumors and by tumor diameter greater than or equal to 10 cm versus less than 10 cm. One hundred four patients were randomized ,  51 to the control group and 53 to the treatment group (five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin 60 mg/m2 days 1 and 2 and ifosfamide 1.8 g/m2 days 1 through 5 ,  with hydration ,  mesna ,  and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) .
Not one new study has been already reported ,  whereas the present Italian co-operative study closed patient accrual in November 1996 because of the results of the planned interim analysis .
Inclusion criteria were as follows ,  age ,  18 to 65 years ,  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2 ,  primary tumors subfascially localized with diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm ,  high-grade spindle-cell or polymorphous sarcomas (fibrosarcoma ,  malignant fibrous histiocytoma ,  polymorphous liposarcoma ,  leiomyosarcoma ,  synovial sarcoma ,  malignant schwannoma ,  angiosarcoma ,  and polymorphous rhabdomyosarcoma) ,  local relapse of any size ,  no previous radio/chemotherapy ,  adequate bone marrow (WBC count of >= 4,000/fiL ,  platelets = 120.000/mL ,  and hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL) ,  renal (creatinine <= 1.3 mg/dL) ,  hepatic (SGOT <= 2.5 X normal value and bilirubin <= 1.2 mg/dL) ,  and pulmonary functions .
Preoperative radiation therapy (44.8 Gy in 28 fractions in 2.5 weeks ,  160 cGy/ fraction ,  2 fractions per day) followed by resection with or without a post-or intraoperative boost (16 to 18 Gy for positive or close surgical margins) was used for tumors extending to critical structures for which conservative surgical resection was expected to be inadequate and amputation would usually have to be performed to obtain negative margins .
Chemotherapy ,  repeated every 3 weeks ,  consisted of five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin (EPI) 60 mg/m2/die ,  in a short intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1 and 2 (total dose per cycle ,  120 mg/m2) ,  IFO 1.8 g/m2/die diluted in 500 mL of normal saline and administered over 1 hour on days 1 through 5 (total dose per cycle ,  9 g/m2) ,  and 6-mercapto-ethansulfonate in a bolus IV injection at 20% of the IFO dose ,  given before and 4 and 8 hours after the IFO infusions .
In the case of incomplete hematologic recovery (defined as WBC < 4,000/mL and platelets [PLTS] < 100.000/mL) ,  treatment was postponed by one or more weeks ,  furthermore ,  on complete hematologic recovery ,  a dose reduction of EPI was applied depending on the observed nadirs (WBC > 1,000/mL and PLTS > 75.000/mL ,  IFO and EPI doses both 100% ,  WBC > 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL ,  IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 75% ,  WBC < 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL ,  IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 50%) .
The same procedures were repeated every 3 months during the third year and every 6 months during the fourth and fifth year of follow-up ,  with a CT scan of the thorax and/or primary site performed at every other visit .
The study period was calculated from randomization to the first occurrence of the considered events (local recurrence alone ,  metastasis with or without local recurrence ,  death due to disease ,  toxic death) .
The present article deals with a minimum observation time of 36 months calculated from the date of randomization of the last patient (11 of 96) .
Because none of the patient characteristics was associated with the end point at the time of univariate analysis ,  unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed by means of the Cox proportional hazards model .
Overall ,  13 patients had a local recurrence of disease as the first relapse without simultaneous distant metastases (four patients in the treatment arm and nine patients in the control arm ,  Table 4) .
The distribution between the different local treatment modalities (radical surgery ,  surgery and postoperative radiation therapy ,  and preoperative radiation therapy and surgery) was respectively ,  two of 16 patients ,  seven of 20 ,  and two of 15 for the control group and three of 20 patients ,  six of 24 ,  and zero of nine for the treatment group .
The median survival time was higher among patients who underwent adjuvant therapy (75 months) ,  compared with untreated patients (46 months) (Fig 4) .
The preliminary data of previous studies were sometimes positive for DFS and OS , 15-19 but further analyses ,  made after an adequate follow-up time ,  indicated a disappearance of the positive effect of chemotherapy on 20,21 and ,  in some cases ,  worse results.22 However ,  the recently published meta-analysis , 7 involving 1,568 patients ,  showed a statistically significant benefit for treated patients of 6% ,  10% ,  and 10% for local ,  metastatic ,  and overall DFS ,  respectively ,  and a favorable (but not statistically significant) trend in OS (4%) ,  after a median of 9.4 years of follow-up .
In fact ,  disease stages ,  tumor sizes ,  and grading varied greatly.23 Second ,  eight studies made use of a polychemotherapy including an anthracycline ,  vincristine ,  cyclophosphamide ,  and dacarbazine ,  but only the first is active in soft tissue sarcomas ,  the others probably increased toxicity .
The early 1990s saw the activation of a number of second-generation protocols throughout the world ,  which ,  although they were planned independently ,  were extraordinarily similar in terms of their selection criteria ,  chemotherapeutic regimens ,  and use of growth factors .
It is directly derived from consecutive phase I-II dose-intensification trials carried out at the Centro di Riferimento Oncologico of Aviano.27,31 The epirubicin dose level of 60 mg/m2 X 2 days represents the step before the maximum-tolerated dose established in those trials (70 mg/m2 epirubicin X 2 days) when given in combination with fixed full doses of ifosfamide (1.8 g/m2/d X 5 days) in advanced cases of soft tissue sarcoma .
In fact ,  despite the routine use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ,  grade 4 leukopenia was observed in 28% of the administered cycles ,  neutropenic fever in 13% of the patients (16 episodes out of 223 cycles ,  7.2%) ,  and anemia requiring multiple transfusions occurred in 24% of the patients .
The main finding of the intention-to-treat analysis in this study is the beneficial impact of chemotherapy on the DFS (P = .04) and OS (P = .03) for patients affected by high-risk extremity soft tissue sarcomas and treated with chemotherapy .
However ,  because our study was designed in 1991 and activated in June 1992 and included only 104 patients ,  it is possible that an imbalance of other prognostic factors not included in Table 1 could have led to the difference in outcome between the two groups .
