Introduction .
Adjuvant chemotherapy of colorectal cancer has been tested in several randomised trials .
Most studies have shown no significant treatment effects ,  and a meta-analysis to test the hypothesis of no effect was unable to dismiss this possibility .
More evidence has emerged lately ,  however ,  that adjuvant chemotherapy of colon cancer may be beneficial .
The route of administration ,  the treatment duration ,  and the drugs to be used are under investigation .
Liver metastases are observed at diagnosis of primary colorectal cancer in 25-30% of patients .
Overt liver metastases seem to be the first site of relapse for 40-50%of patients with operable disease .
Although liver (and other) metastases may originate from circulating cancer cells ,  it is also possible that micrometastases occur early in the disease .
It is generally accepted that adjuvant therapy should be started as soon as possible after surgery ,  when the tumour burden is least .
Surgical stress ,  anaesthetics and other drugs ,  hypercoagulability ,  blood transfusions ,  and surgery-induced impairment of immune function are all reasons why the perioperative period is considered a vulnerable phase in which tumour progression is likely .
Intraportal injection of cytotoxic agents at the time of surgery for colorectal cancer was advocated in 1957 to prevent liver metastases .
Interest in this treatment was stimulated by the promising findings of a 1979 randomised study .
Based on these results ,  several prospective randomised comparisons of intraportal infusion of various regimens after surgery and surgery alone were initiated .
The Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research(SAKK) started one of these trials in 1981 to investigate the effectiveness of a perioperative intraportal cytotoxic regimen with fluorouracil and mitomycin .
The initial response rate was 83% .
We report long-term results here .
Patients and methods .
Between July ,  1981 ,  and March ,  1987 ,  we enrolled 533 patients with adenocarcinoma of colon or rectum who were about to undergo curative resection and were younger than 75 years .
Patients were randomly assigned no adjuvant treatment (control group) or an immediate postoperative intraportal infusion of 500mg/m fluorouracil plus 5000 units heparin in 1 L 5% glucose per 24 h for 7 consecutive days (days 1-7) plus 10 mg/m mitomycin in a single dose on day 1 .
