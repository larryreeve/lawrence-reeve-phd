The incidence is even more pronounced in developing countries  where carcinoma of the cervix is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in females ,   with the majority of the patients  presenting with advanced disease .
While surgery and radiotherapy (RT) are equally effective in early-stage disease ,  radiation  therapy has been the primary treatment modality for stage III disease ,  with 5-year survival rates between 30% to 45% being  reported.4-8 Attempts to improve these results ,  including the use of hypoxic cell sensitizers ,  hyperbaric oxygen therapy , '0  and neutron therapy" have met with limited or no success .
Vogl et al and Alberts et al using a combination of bleomycin ,  vincristine ,   mitomycin ,  and cisplatin (BOMP) in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent disease reported high response rates (> 20% of  the patients with a complete response [CR]) with acceptable toxicity .
To test this  hypothesis ,  we began in 1984 at the Instituto Nacional de Cancer (Rio de Janeiro ,  Brazil) a prospective randomized trial  comparing neoadjuvant BOMP CT followed by pelvic RT (CT + RT) versus pelvic RT alone in patients with stage IIIB carcinoma of  the cervix .
Patients also needed to have adequate medullary reserve (WBC Å½ 4,000/IpL ,  platelet count >  100,000/p.L) and normal renal (BUN < 8.9 mmol/L ,  creatinine < 130 Rimol/L ,  creatinine clearance > 1.17 mL/s) and liver  (alkaline phosphatase < 110 U/L ,  bilirubin < 21 pimol/L) function .
Staging evaluation included a complete medical history and  physical examination ,  cystoscopy ,  chest x-ray ,  bipedal lymphangiogram ,  intravenous (IV) pyelogram ,  complete blood counts ,  and  biochemistries .
In  the CT + RT group ,  11 refused further therapy ,  including pelvic RT ,  after only one cycle of CT ,  and two others were found to  have abnormal renal function after randomization and before commencement of treatment .
The groups were balanced for age ,  extension of parametrial disease ,  lymph node involvement ,   hemoglobin level ,  bulkiness of the cervical disease ,  and the presence of hydronephrosis .
The radiation therapy was administered using an  isocentric technique via a pair of parallel opposed anterior and posterior ports .
The superior limit of the radiation field  was the L5-S1 junction ,  the lower limit wasthe caudal pole of obturator foramen ,  and the lateral boundaries were 1.5 cm  beyond the lymph nodes as demonstrated on lymphangiography .
Chemotherapy consisted of bleomycin 15 U intramuscularly (IM) every 12 hours from days 1 to 4 (total dose ,  120 U) ,   vincristine 1 mg/m2 IV on day 1 ,  mitomycin 10 mg/im 2 IV on day 1 ,  and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1 ,  given on an outpatient  basis every 3 weeks for three cycles .
Six months after activation of the study ,  after nine patients had been treated with CT ,  the bleomycin dose was reduced to 15  U IM every 12 hours from day 1 to day 3 (total dose ,  90 U) ,  and after the first year ,  cisplatin administration was changed  from day 1 to day 4 .
Except for one patient ,  all others received three cycles of CT and were able to tolerate full protocol  doses of vincristine ,  mitomycin ,  and cisplatin .
A CR was defined as the complete resolution of all  measurable disease and symptoms ,  a partial response (PR) was defined as a 50% or more decrease in the sum of the products of  perpendicular diameters of measurable disease ,  and stable disease (SD) was defined as less than a 50% decrease in the sum of  the products of perpendicular diameters of the measurable lesions .
All patients were observed to determine the efficiency of the combined therapy by comparing overall survival ,  rate of local  control ,  incidence of distant metastases ,  and toxicity between treatment regimens .
Patients were stratified by  age (< 50 years v > 50 years) ,  extensiveness of parametrial involvement (unilateral v bilateral) ,  and lymphangiogram nodal  findings (negative v positive) .
We planned to accrue 60 patients into each treatment arm ,  which would produce a power of 80%  and detect an improvement of 25 % in survival with the combined modality treatment at the a = 0.05 level (two-sided test) .
The study was closed earlier because an interim analysis showed that ,  apart from increased serious toxicity ,  survival was  significantly worse in the combined approach group ,  and we did not feel that a positive result could be obtained with a  larger sample .
Seven patients were not included in response assessment in the combined modality group ,  four patients who died  of CT complications ,  two who died of metastatic disease ,  all of them before commencement of RT ,  and one other patient whosepelvic disease progressed during CT and who received palliative irradiation only because of poor general condition .
Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were not a problem ,  with only 7.5% of the patients experiencing a leucocyte nadir of  less than 1,000/ IiL .
Late complications are shown in Table 7 and consisted of proctitis ,  cystitis ,  fistula ,  and vaginal stenosis .
Except for two patients ,  all others had received previous treatment (CT in two ,  pelvic RT in 11 ,  and major  surgery in three) .
Alberts et a119 studied the use of BOMP chemotherapy in 14 previously  treated patients with advanced (stage IVB) and/or recurrent disease and reported a 29% CR rate .
Because of the high CR rate and low toxicity ,  both groups felt that  this combination should be used as a front-line treatment of advanced carcinoma of the cervix .
The rationale for the use of neoadjuvant CT23 is that (1) the blood supply to the tumor is not compromised by previous  radiotherapy or surgery allowing for better drug distribution into the tumor ,  (2) patients' tolerance to CT may be enhanced  as performance status and marrow reserve are unaltered by previous treatment ,  (3) decreasing the bulkiness of the primary  disease would improve the effectiveness of the local RT ,  (4) there is the possibility of eradication of subclinical  metastases ,  and (5) theoretically a tumor may be more chemosensitive before surgery or RT .
Although 25.5% of the patients achieved a CR following three cycles of BOMP and 47% of the CT + RT group obtained a CR at the  end of RT ,  the 5-year overall survival was significantly inferior in the CT + RT group than in the control arm (39% v 21% ,  P  = .02) .
It cannot be accounted for by patient  selection as both groups were well balanced for the wellknown prognostic factors in stage III carcinoma of the cervix.4'24-27  More importantly ,  all patients in the CT + RT arm completed pelvic RT ,  as defined by the protocol guidelines ,  and therefore ,   inadequate irradiation dosage cannot explain the poorer results .
Since repopulation by surviving tumor clonogens is not  a specific response to RT but rather results from killing of tumor cells ,  these authors have suggested that CT ,  which is  effective in killing cells ,  could also lead to an accelerated regrowth of surviving clonogens ,  lessening the effect of  subsequent RT .
Withers et a1 have suggested  that the accelerated repopulationlate in the treatment involves only a small number of surviving cells ,  and rapid  repopulation would not be detectable as a change in volume of the total tumor mass .
Thus ,  a PR or even a CR could therefore  be of questionable value in determining therapeutic effectiveness ,  as tumor masses would be still regressing while the  subclinical clonogenic cell repopulation is accelerating .
The mechanisms responsible for such cross-resistance  remain to be determined ,  but recent studies have shown significant similarity between the cytotoxicity of irradiation and  alkylating agents and that tumor cells may develop mechanisms of resistance capable of decreasing the cytotoxic effects of  some antineoplastic drugs as well as radiation .
Recently ,  Chambers et al also reported a high incidence of pulmonary toxicity in patients receiving BOMP CT for gynecologic  squamous cell carcinoma .
These authors treated 23 patients (20 cervical cancer ,  two vulvar ,  one ovarian) and observed the  development of pulmonary toxicity in eight patients (34.5%) ,  with five of them dying a respiratory death while free of  disease .
