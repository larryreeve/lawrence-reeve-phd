The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 48 months in the treatment group and 16 months in the control group (P = .04) ,  and the median overall survival (OS) was 75 months for treated and 46 months for untreated patients (P = .03) .
Therefore ,  our data favor an intensified treatment in similar cases .
Their main differences ,  compared with the previous studies ,  are the introduction of ifosfamide (IFO) and the intensification of doses in combination with hematopoietic growth factors ,  and more restricted selection criteria .
The time of the analysis (November ,  1999) was 36 months after the last randomization .
Treatment started after the completion of any local treatment and/or as soon as the wound had healed (Fig 1) .
Local Treatment .
Adjuvant Treatment .
Chemotherapy ,  repeated every 3 weeks ,  consisted of five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin (EPI) 60 mg/m2/die ,  in a short intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1 and 2 (total dose per cycle ,  120 mg/m2) ,  IFO 1.8 g/m2/die diluted in 500 mL of normal saline and administered over 1 hour on days 1 through 5 (total dose per cycle ,  9 g/m2) ,  and 6-mercapto-ethansulfonate in a bolus IV injection at 20% of the IFO dose ,  given before and 4 and 8 hours after the IFO infusions .
In the case of incomplete hematologic recovery (defined as WBC < 4,000/mL and platelets [PLTS] < 100.000/mL) ,  treatment was postponed by one or more weeks ,  furthermore ,  on complete hematologic recovery ,  a dose reduction of EPI was applied depending on the observed nadirs (WBC > 1,000/mL and PLTS > 75.000/mL ,  IFO and EPI doses both 100% ,  WBC > 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL ,  IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 75% ,  WBC < 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL ,  IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 50%) .
Physical examinations ,  routine chemistry ,  and x-ray of the thorax and bones underlying the primary site were performed every 2 months and a CT scan of the thorax was performed every 6 months for the first 2 years .
A difference of P <= .001 (two sided) in DFS between the two groups was considered sufficient to stop patient accrual .
In November ,  1996 ,  the per protocol interim analysis of disease-free survival revealed a significant difference in favor of chemotherapy (P = .001) ,  therefore the accrual was stopped and the data reported .
Overall ,  there were no statistically significant differences in the considered parameters between the two groups .
However ,  the median diameter is the same in the two groups ,  and the difference in range is caused by a small number (three patients) of large tumors in the control group .
Local Treatment .
Seven patients (13%) did not start adjuvant treatment .
The median time between surgery and the start of chemotherapy was 62 days (range ,  8 to 187 days) ,  in the three cases with early metastases ,  the time intervals between surgery and relapse were 42 ,  74 ,  and 89 days .
Of the 46 patients that started chemotherapy ,  four did not complete the treatment .
The mean administered doses of the fifth cycle (94 mg of EPI and 8,156 mg of IFO) were slightly lower than those of the fourth cycle (95.5 mg of EPI and 8,257 mg of IFO) .
The average median relative dose-intensity (DI) of the program was 83.3% (Table 2) ,  63% of the cycles were given at a DI of >= 80% and 48% at a DI of >= 90% .
At the time of statistical analysis (November 1999) ,  the median follow-up for the 104 patients included in the study was 59 months ,  61 months in the treatment arm and 55 months in the control arm .
In four patients ,  the first event was a synchronous local relapse with metastases (one patient in the control arm and three patients in the treatment arm) .
Furthermore ,  nine patients developed metachronous relapse at a different site (three were local relapse after a metastasis and six were distant relapses after a previous local relapse) .
The median overall DFS was 48 months among treated patients and 16 months in the control group .
Local DFS .
As the first event ,  a total of 47 distant relapses were observed (22 single distant events in the control group and 21 in the treatment group ,  one synchronous distant and local event in the control group and three in the treatment group Table 4) .
Overall ,  the difference in distant relapses as the first event between the two arms was not significant (P = .48 ,  Fig 3) .
The median survival time was higher among patients who underwent adjuvant therapy (75 months) ,  compared with untreated patients (46 months) (Fig 4) .
Adjuvant treatment of localized soft tissue sarcomas is controversial because no sufficient and convincing data are available .
The preliminary data of previous studies were sometimes positive for DFS and OS , 15-19 but further analyses ,  made after an adequate follow-up time ,  indicated a disappearance of the positive effect of chemotherapy on 20,21 and ,  in some cases ,  worse results.22 However ,  the recently published meta-analysis , 7 involving 1,568 patients ,  showed a statistically significant benefit for treated patients of 6% ,  10% ,  and 10% for local ,  metastatic ,  and overall DFS ,  respectively ,  and a favorable (but not statistically significant) trend in OS (4%) ,  after a median of 9.4 years of follow-up .
Furthermore ,  in the subgroup of 886 patients  affected by extremity sarcomas ,  the difference in OS between treated and untreated patients was significant (P = .029) ,  and the absolute benefit after 10 years increased to 7% .
Furthermore ,  the univariate analysis performed at interim analysis and repeated yearly thereafter for all characteristics reported in Table 1 did not reveal any statistically significant differences between the two patient groups ,  except for chemotherapy .
A difference of P = .001 (two sided) in DFS between the two groups was considered sufficient to stop patient accrual .
This unfavorable local behaviour is mainly because of the dimension of local disease ,  in our opinion .
In fact ,  the median diameter of the primary tumors and relapses was 10 and 9 cm ,  respectively ,  with no differences between treatment and control groups (Table 1) .
However ,  between the three different local approaches there was a trend in favor of preoperative radiation therapy (two local relapse of 24 patients in the control arm ,  8.3%) .
Additionally ,  the difference between the treated and untreated groups is further evidence of the positive impact of chemotherapy on local control ,  as already reported by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer adjuvant trial .
The present trial deals with data obtained at a median follow-up time of 59 months and 36 months after last randomization .
Adjuvant treatment of soft tissue sarcomas is still strongly debated35,36 ,  despite 14 published trials and one meta-analysis performed on 1,568 randomized patients .
