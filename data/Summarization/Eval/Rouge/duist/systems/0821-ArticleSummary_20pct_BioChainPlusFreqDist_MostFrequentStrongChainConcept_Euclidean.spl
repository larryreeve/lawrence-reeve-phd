The inclusion of some patients with previously untreated stage II head and neck cancer reflected the opinion of the combined head and neck clinic that they were unsuitable for cure by surgery or radiotherapy .
Subsequent treatment was dependent on the primary site and on prior treatment ,  but was defined by the protocol to be radiotherapy after completion of protocol chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer .
Statistical analysis used BMDP statistical software to prepare and compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves (program BMDPIL) for the group as a whole and for subgroups by primary site ,  treatment sequence ,  performance status ,  sex ,  age group ,  and response to therapy .
Variables included in the Cox models for all patients with head and neck cancer were treatment group ,  prior radiotherapy ,  performance status ,  sex ,  and prior surgery .
Altogether ,  108 patients were entered ,  including 70 with head and neck cancer of whom 49 had received no prior chemotherapy ,  no radiotherapy ,  and no surgical treatment beyond diagnostic biopsy .
No significant differences in toxicity according to the treatment sequence were observed (Table 2) .
Response categories and median survival durations are summarized in Table 3 .
Differences in response rates between treatment sequences were not statistically significant (Table 3) ,  but there was a consistent trend toward higher response rates in the groups receiving MF .
Even if the most extreme case is assumed and all four nonevaluable patients regarded as nonresponders ,  the difference was still not significant (P = .06 ,  Fisher's exact test ,  with no allowance for multiple comparisons) .
Because most responding patients with head and neck cancer received radiotherapy while still in response ,  no meaningful response duration could be determined ,  instead survival times are presented (Table 3) ,  with a median survival of at least 13 months in all groups .
Survival duration was not significantly different by treatment sequence in univariate analyses ,  though the trend favored the sequence of 5-FU before MTX ,  in which the median survival had not been reached at 23 months ,  compared to a median survival of 13.3 months in the group receiving MTX before 5-FU .
Other factors including stage ,  sex ,  prior radiotherapy ,  and prior surgery were not significant .
The median survival of colorectal cancer patients from start of treatment was only 4.6 months .
No significant sequence-dependent differences in response rate or survival duration were observed among the patients with colorectal cancer .
The median survival from the start of chemotherapy was short (4.6 months) with no significant difference between the two treatment sequences in response rate or survival duration (Table 3) .
Such a differential effect was conceivable in view of the widely differing purine concentrations in bone marrow and peripheral blood .
In fact ,  no significant difference was observed between the toxicities of the two drug sequences (Table 2) ,  suggesting that neither synergy nor antagonism was displayed in the effects of either sequence on normal tissues .
