Intestinal anastomosis has been successfully performed for more than 150 years using a variety of techniques ,  materials ,  and devices .
Of these ,  the method that has proven successful in most situations and in the hands of most surgeons has been the two-layer anastomosis using interrupted silk sutures for an outer inverted seromuscular layer and a running absorbable suture for a transmural inner layer .
Recently ,  several reports have appeared advocating a single-layer continuous anastomosis using monofilament plastic suture .
METHODS .
All two-layer anastomoses were constructed using interrupted 3.0 silk Lembert sutures for the outer layer and a running 3.0 polyglycolic acid suture for the transmural inner layer .
For two-layer anastomoses ,  three packets of 3.0 silk sutures ,  each containing five needled sutures ,  and two packets of 3.0 polyglycolic acid sutures were used .
Each packet of silk sutures cost $9.41 ,  and each packet of polyglycolic acid suture cost $1.88. For single-layer anastomoses ,  one package of double-needled 3.0 polypropylene suture was used .
Each packet of polypropylene suture cost $4.61. RESULTS .
Fifty-nine patients were randomized to single-layer anastomoses and 66 to two-layer anastomoses .
For six patients who required more than one anastomosis ,  the same method was used for each anastomosis .
This resulted in 65 single-layer continuous and 67 two-layer interrupted anastomoses .
Anastomotic leaks ,  intraabdominal abscesses ,  length of time required for anastomosis ,  length of stay ,  and material costs are shown for both groups in Table 2. In 1836 ,  Dieffenbach performed the fist successful anastomosis of the small intestine using Lemberts method .
The single-layer interrupted anastomosis was never entirely abandoned and has periodically attracted renewed interest .
The single-layer continuous anastomosis is a contemporary innovation first described by Hautefeuille in 1976. The present study demonstrates that a single-layer continuous anastomosis is similar in terms of safety to the two-layer technique ,  but that it can be constructed in a significantly shorter time and at a lower cost .
Table 3 shows a collected series of single-layer continuous anastomoses ,  and a leakage rate of 1.7% in 3,027 patients fulfills this criterion .
The mean time saved by creating the single-layer anastomosis ,  10 minutes ,  may seem relatively insignificant .
However ,  our study design did not include the time required to prepare the bowel for anastomosis ,  which is considerably less for the one-layer technique .
This time has been documented by other surgeons using the single-layer continuous method .
The apparent success of the single-layer continuous anastomosis may be attributed to several factors .
We conclude that the single-layer continuous anastomosis requires less time to construct and has a similar risk of leakage compared with the two-layer technique .
