In 1985 ,  the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG ,  study GI 7175) reported that postoperative radiation and chemotherapy reduced the tumor recurrence rate for patients who had undergone a curative resection for rectal adenocarcinoma .
The inferior margin included the perineumin all patients who underwent an abdominal-perineal resection and whose tumor was <= 5 cm from the dentate line .
Dose reduction criteria for the 5-FU escalating arm included no escalation if leukocyte count nadir was below 2,000/UL but at least 1,000/UL and platelet count nadir between 75,000/UL and 99,999/UL and a 25% reduction in the next course for leukocyte nadir below 1,000/UL and platelet count nadir below 75,000/UL .
Disease recurrence required histologic or cytologic documentation with the exception that radiographic techniques could be used to establish the presence of metastases to the lung ,  liver ,  bony structures ,  or brain .
As planned in the protocol design ,  patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm were treated for a longer duration than patients who received escalating 5-FU (median ,  11.3 months v 7.5 months ,  respectively) .
Toxicity resulted in either a temporary or permanent decrease in dose ,  interruption of part of therapy ,  or interruption of all therapy in 62% of 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 53% of escalating 5-FU patients .
Two treatment-related deaths were reported ,  one on each treatment arm .
As in the disease-free analysis ,  secondary analyses of survival considering either all patients randomized or only patients who received treatment after the completion of radiation therapy ,  resulted in no meaningful change in direction or magnitude of the RR attributed to treatment with the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen (RR = 1.10 ,  95% CI ,  .72 to 1.67 ,  and RR = 1.04 ,  95% CI ,  .65 to 1.67 ,  respectively) .
Both survival and disease-free survival results favor the escalating 5-FU arm ,  although these differences did not reach statistical significance .
A recent National Institutes of Health consensus conference on adjuvant therapy for patients with colon and rectal cancer concluded that combined postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy improved local control and survival in stage B2 and C patients with rectal cancer and that treatment with combined modality therapy in these patients is recommended .
