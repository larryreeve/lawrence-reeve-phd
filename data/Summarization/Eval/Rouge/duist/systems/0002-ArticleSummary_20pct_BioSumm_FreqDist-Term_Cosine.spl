Radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea has been compared in separate trials with radiotherapy alone ,  with radiotherapy and concomitant therapy with misonidazole ,  and with radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil (and Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) .
However ,  treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and radiotherapy resulted in greater improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival than did treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy (Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) .
Therefore ,  we undertook a randomized study in which all women with locally advanced cervical cancer received local radiation as well as weekly concomitant treatment with cisplatin alone ,  the combination of cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  or hydroxyurea alone .
Women with untreated invasive squamous-cell carcinoma ,  adenosquamous carcinoma ,  or adenocarcinoma of the cervix of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIB (localized disease with parametrial involvement) ,  stage III (extension of the tumor to the pelvic wall) ,  or stage IVB (involvement of the bladder or rectal mucosa) were enrolled in the study from April 1992 to April 1997 .
Patients were required to have a Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status of 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  or 3 (equivalent to Karnofsky performance scores of 90 or 100 ,  70 or 80 ,  50 or 60 ,  and 30 or 40 ,  respectively) and to have no history of other cancers .
The total dose delivered to point A (a reference location 2 cm lateral and 2 cm superior to the cervical os) was 80.8 Gy in patients with stage IIB and 81.0 Gy in patients with stage III or IVA disease ,  the total dose delivered to point B (the pelvic wall) was 55.0 Gy in patients with stage IIB disease and 60.0 Gy in patients with stage III or IVA disease .
We calculated the target sample size of 165 patients for each regimen on the basis of an ability to detect a 35 percent decrease in the rate of disease progression with the use of either radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin or radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea .
The design called for final analysis when disease progression (or death) had occurred in 104 patients receiving the control regimen (radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea) .
At the time of this analysis 104 patients had had progression of disease in the control group and 89 patients had died ,  with or without disease progression - 86 percent of the number of deaths needed for a final analysis of survival .
From April 1992 to April 1997 ,  575 patients were enrolled ,  192 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin ,  191 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 192 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with hydroxyurea .
Forty-nine of these patients (9 percent) were subsequently found to be ineligible for the following reasons ,  because of deviations from the surgical protocol for the evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (44 patients) ,  ineligible stage of disease (2) ,  metastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes (1) ,  incorrect primary diagnosis (1) ,  and incomplete pretreatment testing (1) .
Thus ,  a total of 526 patients were included in the analysis ,  176 in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  173 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 177 in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
The relative risk of progression of disease or death was 0.57 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.42 to 0.78) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0.55 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.40 to 0.75) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy ,  after adjustment for the clinical stage of disease .
After adjustment for these five factors ,  the relative risks of disease progression for the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea were extremely close (relative risks ,  0.58 and 0.55 ,  respectively) to the estimates obtained after adjustment for clinical stage of disease alone .
The rates of progression-free survival at 24 months were 67 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  64 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 47 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
A total of 205 patients have died (39 percent) ,  59 in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  57 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 89 in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
After adjustment for the clinical stage of disease ,  the relative risk of death was 0.61 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.44 to 0.85) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0.58 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.41 to 0.81) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
Survival rates were also significantly better in these two groups (P=0.004 and P=0.002 ,  respectively) than in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy (Fig. 2) .
Patients in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea had less local progression (19 percent and 20 percent ,  respectively) than those in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy (30 percent) .
The number of patients who received within 15 percent of the prescribed total dose to both point A (69 to 93 Gy) and point B (stage IIB ,  47 to 63 Gy ,  stage III or IVA ,  51 to 59 Gy) was 159 (90 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  147 (85 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 149 (84 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
The median duration of treatment was 9.0 weeks (10th and 90th percentiles ,  7.1 and 11.9 ,  respectively) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  9.3 weeks (10th and 90th percentiles ,  7.6 and 11.6) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 8.9 weeks (10th and 90th percentiles ,  7.2 and 11.2) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
The median delay was 8 days (the 10th percentile was a time 2 days ahead of schedule ,  and the 90th percentile was a delay of 22 days) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  10 days (10th and 90th percentiles ,  1 and 26) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 8 days (10th and 90th percentiles ,  1 day ahead of schedule and a delay of 23 days) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
The frequencies of both grade 3 and grade 4 leukopenia in the group given radio-therapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea were more than double the frequencies in the other two groups (P<0.001) .
The frequencies of other hematologic effects of both grade 3 and grade 4 - predominantly granulocytopenia - in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea therapy were approximately double those in the other two groups (P<0.001) .
We found higher rates of survival and progression-free survival among patients who were treated with radiotherapy and either cisplatin alone or cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea than among patients who were treated with radiotherapy and hydroxyurea alone .
However ,  in a small study of 45 patients with cervical cancer ,  radiotherapy and chemotherapy with cisplatin (25 mg per square meter per week) increased the rate of local control by 35 percent (P<0.025 for the comparison with radiotherapy alone) ,  but there was no long-term improvement in survival .
In a phase 3 trial conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group ,  388 patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy either with cisplatin and fluorouracil or with hydroxyurea (Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) ,  the two-drug regimen improved survival (relative risk of death ,  0.74 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.58 to 0.95) .
In the phase 3 study by Morris et al. ,  whose results are reported in this issue of the Journal ,  radiotherapy in combination with treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil significantly improved the rates of disease-free survival and overall survival among women with stage IB through IVA cervical cancer .
Our results demonstrate the superiority of radiotherapy and chemotherapy either with cisplatin alone or with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (stage IIB ,  III ,  or IVA without metastasis to the para-aortic lymph nodes) .
