In 1993 ,  the sample size goal was increased because of the lower than expected recurrence rate ,  a better estimate of the change in the recurrence rate over time ,  and a small ,  but significant ,  frequency of noncompliance in the radiation therapy (RT) regimen .
This goal would allow the detection of a 47% reduction in the risk of recurrence with complete compliance or 50% reduction with 8% noncompliance among those registeredto the RT regimen .
The ureter had to be unroofed from its entry into the broad ligament to its intramural portion in the bladder and dissected laterally from its attachments to the cardinal ligament .
Treatment breaks for clinical problems (vomiting or diarrhea) were allowed to total no more than 1 week .
Follow-up Observation .
Review of operative reports was conducted to evaluate the completeness of surgical procedures .
Statistical Methods .
Life tables were computed using the method of Kaplan and Meier .
The median age at study entry was 41 (range ,  20–80) and the 25th and 75th percentiles were 34 and 50 ,  respectively .
The distribution of these factors as well as the GOG performance scale were well balanced between the two treatment regimens (Table 2) .
There was a disproportionately larger number of patients with positive CLS among the NFT regimen (24% versus 35%) and more patients with .4 cm diameter tumors in the RT regimen (62% versus 54%) .
The crude estimate in the reduction in risk in patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy was 47% (i.e. ,  relative risk 5 0.53) with the recurrence-free rate of 88% in the radiotherapy group and 79% in the no-further-therapy group at 2 years (Fig. 1) .
Eighty-six percent of patients have either died or have been followed at least 3 years .
The median follow-up is 5 years for those who are alive with no evidence of disease .
Of those who are alive ,  six patients are lost-to-follow-up within the first year in the RT group while one is lost in the NFT group .
DISCUSSION .
Chung et al. reported that cervical cancer larger than 4 cm in diameter determined by preoperative palpation was associated with a 5-fold increase in pelvic lymph node metastases ,  a 10-fold increase in recurrences ,  and a 50% decrease in survival .
The invasion of lymphvascular spaces by tumor has been found to be an unfavorable prognostic factor by many investigators but its significance was denied by others .
Boyce reported that vascular invasion contributed prognostic information beyond the cervical size .
However ,  Roche and Norris questioned the validity of the CLS finding because ,  as they state ,  if enough sections are made ,  most cases might show vascular invasion .
Of the three risk factors ,  depth of invasion seems the most objective and accurate method—a direct measurement on the histological slide .
Nevertheless ,  the use of this formula by the participating institutions has been successful in achieving a high acceptance rate with only 22 patients (7%) found ineligible for the study .
How local therapy affects distal spread is not clearly understood ,  hypothetical mechanisms include eliminating the risk of subsequent spread from an uncontrolled primary .
This difference can be explained by an overestimation of risk by the regression model which commonly occurs ,  this phenomena is sometimes referred to as regression to the mean .
Partly due to this lower risk ,  the sample size was increased in August 1993 in order that the statistical power of the trial would be maintained .
A significant number of women with Stage IB cervical cancer should benefit from adjuvant pelvic irradiation because 25% of the lymph-node negative patients have high risk factors according to the 1990 GOG data .
Moreover ,  Thomas and Dembo have demonstrated that ,  in absolute terms ,  an equal number of deaths occur among the estimated 85% of Stage IB cervical cancer patients with negative nodes as among the 15% with positive nodes .
Especially vulnerable to adverse radiation effects are the bladder and the ureters due to compromised circulation from surgical dissection and the intestines because of adhesions and reduced motility .
One of these women died from complications of enteric fistula and another died from cancer after successful management of intestinal injury .
This conclusion is based on a significant reduction of cancer recurrences in patients in our study and acceptably low morbidity with a single treatment-related fatality .
