The primary endpoint is overall survival ,  secondaryendpoints are disease-free survival ,  rate of loco-regionalrecurrence ,  and treatment-related toxicity/morbidity .
Protocol entry criteria are ,  en-bloc resection of all known tumour ,  a surgical specimen which must be adequate for TNM staging ,  pT3-4 ,  pN0 ,  M0 and pT 1-4 ,  pNl-3 ,  M0 primary rectal adenocarcinoma ,  microscopically negative resection margins .
Patients randomized in Arm II begin with the first cycle of 5-FU (450 mg/sqm/d iv bolus on days 1-5) plus ievamisole (150 mg/d orally on days 1-3) .
The primary end-point of the study is overall survival and the expected 5-year survival in RT-treated patients is 50% ,  hence ,  175 patients will be enrolled in each arm to obtain 80% power of the study related to 15% increase of 5-year survival in RT+CT treated patients .
No significant differences as regards sex ,  age ,  performance states ,  type of operation (sphincter-saving resection or abdominoperineal excision of the rectum) ,  pT ,  pN stages of disease ,  number of sampled lymph-nodes ,  and grading were observed in 76 and 73 patients randomized in Arms I and II ,  respectively .
The median randomization time occurred on the 19th post-operative day (range ,  6-24 days) ,  on average ,  patients began RT 43 days from surgery (range ,  27-98 days) .
