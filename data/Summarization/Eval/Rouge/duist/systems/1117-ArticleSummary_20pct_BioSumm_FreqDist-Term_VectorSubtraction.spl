Introduction .
Methods .
Between September ,  1986 ,  and December ,  1991 ,  578 patients with primary invasive cervical cancer were referred to the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Radiation Oncology ,  at the Istituto di Scienze Biomediche S Gerardo ,  University of Milan ,  Monza .
The cervical diameter was assessed by alginate mould .
The codes were revealed after we had obtained the patient’s informed consent .
A boost of 5–10 Gy was given to the positive nodes .
The secondary outcome measure was recurrence of the disease .
We classified complications as ,  grade 1 ,  mild symptoms not affecting the patient’s health and easily cured ,  grade 2 ,  symptoms that can be resolved by long-term medical therapies ,  grade 3 ,  major symptoms that require surgery or invasive procedures and affect the performance status of the patient ,  or fatal complications .
Statistical analysis .
No interim analysis was done .
We compared quantitative data by one-way analysis of variance .
A significance level of 95% was chosen .
Survival and relapses were analysed by intention to treat .
Results .
We excluded these cases from the analysis .
Survival and recurrence .
Median follow-up was 87 (range 57–120) months .
Results of univariate and multivariate analysis are shown in table 4 .
Of these 86 patients ,  60 (70%) died of disease .
Complications .
Complications were classified according to the glossary of Chassagne and colleagues.10 In the surgery group ,  48 (28%) patients showed severe (grade 2–3) morbidity that required medical or surgical treatment ,  compared with 19 (12%) patients in the radiotherapy group ,  (p=0·0004 ,  table 3) .
This accounts for an overall mortality rate of 0·6% .
Discussion .
Newton5 reported that the 5-year survival rate for 119 patients with stage-I disease accrued over 10 years in a partly randomised study was 81% for radical surgery and 74% for radiotherapy ,  this difference was not significant .
Morley and Seski’s study ,  of 446 patients with stage-Ib disease recruited between 1945 and 1975 and treated with radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy or external irradiation and brachyradiotherapy ,  reported crude 5-year survival of 87% and 83% ,  respectively .
Most complications can be easily corrected .
These data are confirmed by other previous studies .
In Italy ,  a prospective randomised trial has been under way since 1993 to assess the best adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) for high-risk patients after radical surgery for FIGO stage Ib–IIa cancer .
This finding should resolve some of the conflicting approaches to this issue.14–16 Our results suggest that the optimum candidates for primary radical surgery are women with normal ovarian function and cervical diameters of 4 cm or smaller ,  whereas radiotherapy is preferable for postmenopausal women .
