ALTHOUGH much progress has been made in the early detection and control of carcinoma of the cervix since the introduction of  the Papanicolau test ,  it is estimated that about 13,500 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 1990 in  the United States with 6,000 patients dying from the disease .
The incidence is even more pronounced in developing countries  where carcinoma of the cervix is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in females ,   with the majority of the patients  presenting with advanced disease .
While surgery and radiotherapy (RT) are equally effective in early-stage disease ,  radiation  therapy has been the primary treatment modality for stage III disease ,  with 5-year survival rates between 30% to 45% being  reported.4-8 Attempts to improve these results ,  including the use of hypoxic cell sensitizers ,  hyperbaric oxygen therapy , '0  and neutron therapy" have met with limited or no success .
The role of chemotherapy (CT) ,  either as a single agent or in  combination ,  has been extensively evaluated in advanced or recurrent disease .
Response rates ranging from 0% to 90% have been  reported but are usually of short duration .
Vogl et al and Alberts et al using a combination of bleomycin ,  vincristine ,   mitomycin ,  and cisplatin (BOMP) in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent disease reported high response rates (> 20% of  the patients with a complete response [CR]) with acceptable toxicity .
Because of the high remission rate ,  these authors felt  this combination should be used as a front-line treatment for locally advanced cervical cancer .
The use of upfront CT as  initial treatment before pelvic RT would be theoretically advantageous as the vascular supply to the tumor is not  compromised ,  allowing a higher local tissue concentration of drugs ,  thereby improving the effectiveness of CT .
To test this  hypothesis ,  we began in 1984 at the Instituto Nacional de Cancer (Rio de Janeiro ,  Brazil) a prospective randomized trial  comparing neoadjuvant BOMP CT followed by pelvic RT (CT + RT) versus pelvic RT alone in patients with stage IIIB carcinoma of  the cervix .
Here we report the results of this study .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Patient Entry Criteria and Evaluation .
Between April 1984 and August 1986 ,  107 previously untreated patients with stage III B carcinoma of the cervix were entered  on the study .
Eligibility criteria consisted of a histopathologic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma ,  age younger than 70  years with no past history of malignancy ,  the lower third of the vagina free of disease ,  and a performance status greater  than 50% in the Karnofsky scale .
In  the CT + RT group ,  11 refused further therapy ,  including pelvic RT ,  after only one cycle of CT ,  and two others were found to  have abnormal renal function after randomization and before commencement of treatment .
Three in the RT arm refused further  treatment after only a few fractions of irradiation were delivered .
Treatment Regimens .
Late complications were graded as  per the morbidity grading system suggested by Pilepich et al , 2 which takes into consideration the impact of the complication  on the patient performance and/or life-style and the required treatment for such complications (Table 2) .
The study was closed earlier because an interim analysis showed that ,  apart from increased serious toxicity ,  survival was  significantly worse in the combined approach group ,  and we did not feel that a positive result could be obtained with a  larger sample .
Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method21 and was measured from day 1 of therapy until last  follow-up or death .
Actuarial survival curves were compared by the log-rank method .
Evaluation of tumor response by pelvic examination following therapy for advanced cervical cancer is a subjective and  imprecise method of assessment .
The overall 5-year actuarial  survival for the two groups is shown in Fig 1 .
Median survivals were 25 months in the RT arm and 10.5 months in the CT + RT .
The cisplatin treatment day was then changed from day 1 to  day 4 but yet another patient developed the same problem (one of 12 treated patients) .
At this time ,  an interim analysis that  was performed disclosed a survival advantage for the RT group ,  and it was then decided to close the study .
Except for two patients ,  all others had received previous treatment (CT in two ,  pelvic RT in 11 ,  and major  surgery in three) .
Treatments were well  tolerated ,  and some longterm remissions were observed .
Although 25.5% of the patients achieved a CR following three cycles of BOMP and 47% of the CT + RT group obtained a CR at the  end of RT ,  the 5-year overall survival was significantly inferior in the CT + RT group than in the control arm (39% v 21% ,  P  = .02) .
Furthermore ,  even if we exclude the patients who experienced  treatment-related death ,  the survival in the BOMP group remains significantly inferior (39% v 25%) .
This may explain why in spite of a satisfactory rate of response following neoadjuvant CT ,  there was no  improvement in local tumor control ,  and survival was adversely affected .
Some randomized studies have ,  in  fact ,  showed worse survival with the use of neoadjuvant CT .
It is a subjective evaluation that frequently depends on the ability of the investigator to differentiate  between residual local disease or treatment-induced parametrial fibrosis .
