Additional concern was raised by data suggesting that irradiated patients have reduced survival rates ,  due to either immune suppression or cardiac complications .
Nevertheless ,  there are reasons to reconsider radiotherapy ,  including the limited value of adjuvant chemotherapy for bulky disease ,  a synergistic effect of chemotherapy plus radiation on residual locoregional tumor ,  and the possibility that eliminating bulky disease with radiation may improve the effect of chemotherapy ,  because chemotherapy may be more effective when the overall disease burden is low .
From 1979 through 1986 ,  318 premenopausal women with newly diagnosed stage I or II breast cancer were enrolled in the study after undergoing modified radical mastectomy if ,  after axillary-node dissection ,  one or more level I or II lymph nodes were found to be positive on pathological examination .
After written informed consent was obtained ,  the patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups ,  those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy plus locoregional radiotherapy in five fields (the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group ,  with 164 patients) and those receiving chemotherapy alone (the chemotherapy group ,  with 154 patients) .
The surgery was performed by specialists who referred all the patients to the British Columbia Cancer Agency ,  the provincial cancer institute ,  for registration ,  randomization ,  and the planning of the chemotherapy and radiation treatments .
The chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (600 mg per square meter of body-surface area) ,  methotrexate (40 mg per square meter) ,  and fluorouracil (600 mg per square meter) (the CMF regimen) ,  given intravenously every 21 days as described by Bonadonna et al. ,  initially for 12 months (80 patients) ,  and in the case of patients randomized after 1981 ,  for 6 months .
In the various analyses ,  we studied the following end points ,  any relapse of breast cancer (or death without a known relapse of breast cancer) ,  for the analysis of disease-free survival ,  locoregional recurrence as a first event ,  before a systemic recurrence (in the ipsilateral chest wall or an axillary ,  internal mammary ,  or supraclavicular node) ,  for the analysis of survival free of locoregional disease ,  any systemic relapse ,  with or without a locoregional relapse (or death without a known systemic relapse) ,  for the analysis of survival free of systemic disease ,  death from breast cancer ,  for the analysis of breast-cancer–specific survival ,  and any death ,  for the analysis of overall survival .
The patients in that study were similar to those in our cohort ,  there was a large and homogeneous group of premenopausal ,  node-positive patients treated with chemotherapy and five-field radiotherapy .
The other eight studies were notsimilar to ours or the Danish trial ,  either because the number of randomized premenopausal patients was small or because the radiotherapy techniques or the chemotherapy schedules were heterogeneous .
Four randomized trials comparing breast irradiation with no irradiation in patients who underwent conservative surgery showed significant reductions in the rate of relapse in the breast but no effect on systemic recurrences or overall survival .
