All patients received standard pretreatment evaluation ,  which included complete blood analysis ,  intravenous pyelogram ,  lymphangiography ,  cystoscopy ,  chest radiography ,  and other tests when indicated .
We used the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) clinical staging system to classify the stage of cancer.7 If there was disagreement about the stage ,  the case was assigned to the earlier stage. 468 patients had FIGO stage Ib or IIa disease. 343 of these patients were enrolled after they had given their informed consent to take part .
Eligibility criteria were ,  age 30–70 years ,  newly diagnosed stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  no concurrent or previous malignant disease ,  WHO performance status of 1 or less ,  and feasibility of both radical surgery and radiotherapy .
Radiotherapy included ,  external pelvic irradiation with 18 MV photon beam by the multiportal technique ,  one dose of 1·8–2·0Gy at the isocentre ,  and two or more portals treated daily .
When lymphangiography showed common iliac or paraortic metastases ,  paraortic lymph nodes were treated with a dose of 45 Gy over 5 weeks and two shaped opposed fields (AP-PA) .
The pathologist provided us with histological subtypes ,  grade ,  depth of invasion ,  tumour size ,  presence of capillary-like-space involvement ,  paracervical-tissue involvement ,  and number ,  site ,  and type of lymph-node metastases .
We classified complications as ,  grade 1 ,  mild symptoms not affecting the patient’s health and easily cured ,  grade 2 ,  symptoms that can be resolved by long-term medical therapies ,  grade 3 ,  major symptoms that require surgery or invasive procedures and affect the performance status of the patient ,  or fatal complications .
We used multivariate Cox regression analysis to assess the effect of cervical size ,  age ,  FIGO state ,  histological type ,  grade of differentiation ,  radiological lymph-node status ,  and treatment group on overall survival .
Adjuvant radiotherapy was done in 62 (54%) of the 114 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter of 4 cm or smaller and in 46 (84%) of 55 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm. 19 patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or less and three patients whose cervical diameter was greater than 4 cm had lymph-vascular-space involvement as the only pathological risk factor ,  these patients did not receive postoperative irradiation .
For rates of adenocarcinoma there was a significant advantage for patients who had surgery compared with those who had radiotherapy in both overall survival (70% vs 59% ,  p=0·05) and disease-free survival (66% vs 47% ,  p=0·02) .
Overall survival for the 108 surgery-group patients who received adjuvant treatment (high-risk group) compared with the patients with surgery alone (low-risk group) or radiotherapy alone (unknown risk) is shown in figure 4 ,  .
In addition ,  among women with a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm ,  there was a significantly higher rate of pelvic relapse among those who had radiotherapy than among those who had surgery plus adjuvant irradiation (16 [70%] vs 9 [53%] ,  p=0·46) .
Three (1·7%) surgery-group patients had perioperative complications ,  one vascular lesion during lymphadenectomy ,  one postoperative ureterovaginal fistula ,  and one fatal pulmonary embolism .
Other vesical complications (severe actinic cystitis ,  stress incontinence ,  high-pressure bladder) were recorded in two (3%) patients after surgery ,  11 (10%) after surgery plus radiotherapy ,  and in eight (5%) after radiotherapy alone .
Morley and Seski’s study ,  of 446 patients with stage-Ib disease recruited between 1945 and 1975 and treated with radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy or external irradiation and brachyradiotherapy ,  reported crude 5-year survival of 87% and 83% ,  respectively .
Surgery also offers other advantages ,  pelvic relapses can be successfully cured by radiotherapy ,  whereas salvage surgery after primary irradiation carries a high rate of failures and severe morbidity .
Morbidity is associated with both treatment strategies ,  though the most severe complications ,  such as operative mortality ,  urological complications ,  and tissue damage from irradiation ,  have been reduced during the past 20 years .
In our experience ,  the combination of surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy carries the worst morbidity ,  especially long-term (delayed in onset) complications ,  that are difficult to record during the follow-up .
Hydroureteronephroses ,  oedema of the lower limbs ,  various vesical complications ,  and bowel morbidity are more common and compromising in women who undergo surgery plus radiotherapy .
In Italy ,  a prospective randomised trial has been under way since 1993 to assess the best adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) for high-risk patients after radical surgery for FIGO stage Ib–IIa cancer .
Most women with stage Ib–IIa cervical cancer can be treated successfully with radiotherapy ,  whereas a judicious selection of patients is necessary before planning primary radical surgery .
Women whose cervical diameters are larger than 4 cm should be identified before surgery so that they can benefit from tailored treatment ,  radical radiotherapy ,  with the option of concomitant radiosensitising chemotherapy to improve the local control of the disease ,  or cisplatinbased chemotherapy followed by radical surgery .
