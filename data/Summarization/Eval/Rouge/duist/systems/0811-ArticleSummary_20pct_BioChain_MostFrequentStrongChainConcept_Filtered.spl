ADVANCED colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common oncologic challenges encountered in the Western world .
Nevertheless ,  there is little evidence of effective therapy for such patients other than symptomatic and supportive care. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is considered by many as the standard of chemotherapy ,  but in larger experiences with this agent ,  response rates have only been in the 15% to 20% range .
The purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate ,  by such a randomized and controlled comparison ,  a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5-FU activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials .
Thymidine given at high doses in animal model systems has been shown to increase both therapeutic activity and toxicity of 5-FU and to improve the therapeutic index of this agent .
Pilot and phase 2 trials of this combination in humans showed the dose-limiting toxicity to be mucocutaneous effects .
The first was a small surgical adjuvant study reported by Verhaegen et al in which levamisole-treated patients had a significantly improved survival when compared with untreated controls .
If this result could be confirmed it would be the first time that any regimen has demonstrated such significant survival improvement for advanced colorectal cancer in randomized trials .
In a randomized trial ,  this group showed that this combination produced superior response rates and survival when compared with their own variant of the 5-FU ,  methyl CCNU ,  vincristine combination .
Again it would seem appropriate that the activity and toxicity of the MOF-Strept combination be placed in perspective by a randomized comparison with 5-FU alone .
We elected to use survival as our primary endpoint in patients with both measurable and nonmeasurable disease and also to evaluate objective response rates among those patients with measurable disease .
For the 5-FU plus thymidine regimen ,  patients were evaluated every 4 weeks ,  while for all other regimens ,  this evaluation occurred every 5 weeks .
If severe toxicity had been obtained with a previous treatment course ,  drug dosages were appropriately reduced with subsequent therapy .
The primary endpoint of our overall study was patient survival .
It was required that this result be observed at least 4 weeks after the onset of therapy ,  but there was no requirement for duration of response .
Each combination regimen was compared to treatment with 5- FU alone with respect to duration of survival following randomization ,  time to disease progression. objective regression rates among measurable patients ,  and toxic reactions .
Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method .
RESULTS .
Toxicity .
MOF-Strept was characterized by substantially more frequent and more severe nausea and vomiting ,  and this was the only regimen characterized by a substantive incidence of thrombocytopenia. 5-FU plus PALA had substantially more frequent mucocutaneous reactions and somewhat more frequent diarrhea ,  but less hematologic toxicity than 5-FU alone or any of the other regimens .
The most unique toxicity of this regimen was a substantially increased incidence of neurologic effects .
It is noteworthy that while the MOF-Strept regimen had the highest regression rate ,  it was also the regimen with the lowest proportion of patients whose disease remained stable and the highest proportion of patients in whom the best response observed was tumor regression .
Figure 2 displays the patient survival according to treatment regimen .
The median survival for all patients was 81/4 months .
The results of this study were singularly discouraging .
It is entirely possible that different proportionate representation of drug dosages or different scheduling could produce more favorable or less favorable results than we observed .
The dose-limiting mucocutaneous toxicity that we observed undoubtedly represented the additive effects of both agents .
Our results were disappointing .
With the 5-FU-thymidine combination ,  we observed a marked modulation of 5-FU effect with regard to both dose and toxicity .
Our experience with the 5-FU-levamisole combination was particularly discouraging in view of the early study of the University of Wisconsin ,  indicating that this combination could produce substantial survival improvement .
One cannot conclude that this regimen added to the quality of patient life ,  and since it did not add to duration of life ,  we must conclude that this regimen has little to recommend it .
Whereas the results of this study were negative ,  these should not discourage continued efforts to exploit the biochemical modulation approaches .
We would hope this could be done more successfully with increasing knowledge of how best to apply the results of experimental models in the clinical settings .
