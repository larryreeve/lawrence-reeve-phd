Adjuvant chemotherapy of colorectal cancer has been tested in several randomised trials .
Most studies have shown no significant treatment effects and a meta-analysis to test the hypothesis of no effect was unable to dismiss this possibility .
More evidence has emerged lately however that adjuvant chemotherapy of colon cancer may be beneficial .
Liver metastases are observed at diagnosis of primary colorectal cancer in 25-30 of patients .
Overt liver metastases seem to be the first site of relapse for 40-50of patients with operable disease .
Patients were randomly assigned no adjuvant treatment control group or an immediate postoperative intraportal infusion of 500mg/m fluorouracil plus 5000 units heparin in 1 L 5 glucose per 24 h for 7 consecutive days days 1-7 plus 10 mg/m mitomycin in a single dose on day 1. To be eligible patients had to have no evidence of metastatic disease in preoperative investigations .
29 patients had liver metastases diagnosed at resection and 8 had incomplete resection .
We excluded 28 patients 26 did not have adenocarcinoma lymphoma ovarian cancer urothelial cancer and others and in 2 the protocol was violated radiation therapy to the pelvis was added for rectal cancer .
The 37 patients who had metastases diagnosed at surgery or had incomplete resection were regarded as having relapsed on the day of surgery .
5 patients were lost to follow-up .
The group assigned perioperative portal chemotherapy had significantly higher 5-year disease-free survival than the control group table 2. At median follow-up of 96 months 235 patients had died 108 in the infusion group and 127 in the control group .
5-year overall survival was also higher in the infusion group table 2. Similarly liver recurrences were less frequent in infusion-treated patients within the node-positive and colon-cancer subgroups .
Transient leucopenia 3 X10 white blood cells per L developed in 6 patients during adjuvant chemotherapy and the white-blood-cell count was significantly lower on postoperative days 7 and 10 in the infusion group than in the control group .
This trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase survival in patients with colorectal cancer .
We did find however a consistent reduction of all kinds of tumour recurrences that resulted in a significant advantage in overall survival and disease-free survival for patients treated with adjuvant portal infusion confirming previous findings .
Previous investigations with the exception of one have shown improvements in overall and disease-free survival and a reduction in the frequency of liver recurrences especially in the subgroups of colon cancer patients and of those with tumour-involved regional lymph nodes Dukes C .
Two as yet unpublished meta-analyses of all randomised trials comparing portal adjuvant chemotherapy with a no-treatment control group have been conducted by the European Organization on Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Oxford Colorectal Cancer Cooperative Group .
Both analyses are based on data for more than 3000 patients the results show a statistically significant overall and disease-free survival advantage for patients who received portal adjuvant therapy .
It seems likely that the effect of adjuvant portal chemotherapy on overall and disease-free survival can be attributed to the systemic effects of intraportal fluorouracil which lead to a reduction in all tumour relapses ie local recurrences liver metastases and other distant metastases .
