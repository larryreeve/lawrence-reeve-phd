We therefore conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial in which sequential MTX followed by 5-FU was compared to the same drugs given in the opposite order .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Histopathologic confirmation of diagnosis .
Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the requirements of the institutional ethics committee .
SEQUENTIAL MTX/5-FU .
In either case ,  the dose of MTX was 250 mg/m2 ,  and the dose of 5-FU was 600 mg/m2 .
Patients who showed complete or partial response received a further four courses at two-week intervals ,  while those with stable or progressive disease discontinued chemotherapy .
Subsequent treatment was dependent on the primary site and on prior treatment ,  but was defined by the protocol to be radiotherapy after completion of protocol chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer .
Statistical analysis used BMDP statistical software to prepare and compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves (program BMDPIL) for the group as a whole and for subgroups by primary site ,  treatment sequence ,  performance status ,  sex ,  age group ,  and response to therapy .
Among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  disease stage expressed as TNM separately and as stage grouping ,  using standard definitions of the American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging and- End Result reporting were also examined as possible prognostic factors for response and survival .
Standard WHO definitions of response categories and toxicity grades were followed .
Although the pretreatment stratification was by primary site only ,  a reasonable balance of prognostic factors was achieved (Table 1) ,  but there was a trend to less favorable performance status in the group receiving 5-FU before MTX .
Two patients on each treatment sequence were withdrawn from treatment because of severe but nonlethal toxicity .
Other factors including stage ,  sex ,  prior radiotherapy ,  and prior surgery were not significant .
The median survival of colorectal cancer patients from start of treatment was only 4.6 months .
We therefore conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of sequential MTX followed one hour later by 5-FU versus the same drugs administered one hour apart but in the opposite order .
To our knowledge ,  these are the only prospective randomized clinical trials yet reported that test the importance of the sequence of administration of 5-FU and MTX .
