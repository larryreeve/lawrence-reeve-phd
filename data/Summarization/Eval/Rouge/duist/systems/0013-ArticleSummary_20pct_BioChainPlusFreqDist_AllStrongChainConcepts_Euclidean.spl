ALTHOUGH MANY PATIENTS with carcinoma of the uterine cervix are cured with local measures ,  a substantial minority recur or present with metastases and are potential candidates for systemic therapy .
DAG is probably an alkylating agent .
Since both drugs have activityin cervical cancer ,  it seemed reasonable to evaluate this combination .
Nevertheless ,  the possibility existed that the combination ,  with two CRs and five PRs (39% response rate) ,  produced improved results .
Measurements by computed tomography (CT) scan were accepted if the lesion was > 3 cm and sharply defined .
If a measurable lesion monitored by CT scan was less than 3 cm , it must have been confirmed by biopsy or cytology .
Originally ,  the protocol was less stringent about renal function and had no specification about serum albumin level .
The use of lorazepam was discouraged in such patients in order not to mask the possible neurotoxicity of ifosfamide .
The design for this study was based on the assumption that a 15% increase in the response rate due to the addition of either mitolactolor ifosfamide to cisplatin would be regarded as clinically meaningful .
Therefore ,  the primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients who responded to the cisplatin-only regimen versus each of the combination regimens .
The adjusted relative risk of survival and progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed with a linear proportional hazards model .
RESULTS .
There was more granulocytopenia ,  thrombocytopenia , and leukocytopenia associated with C + M compared with cisplatin alone (P < .025) .
There was a significantly greater frequency of response(31.1%) among patients treated with CIFX compared with cisplatin alone (17.8% ,  P = .004 ,  Table 4) .
The frequency of response among those treated with C + M (21.1%) was only slightly greater than cisplatin and not statistically significant .
Chemotherapy concurrently with definitive radiation therapy as a radiosensitizer has been used in some cases of cervix cancer in recent years .
It remains to be seen whether the addition of bleomycin will be helpful ,  that is the subject of a current randomized trial .
The pilot study on which the C +M arm of the present trial was based identified 180 mg/m for 5 days as the maximum-tolerated dose in combination with cisplatin .
Perhaps that dose of mitolactol is too low to provide an additional effect with cisplatin .
Cisplatin alone has limited value in advanced cervix cancer ,  we are not aware of a randomized trial of cisplatin versus supportive care .
Perhaps this is a step in the right direction ,  albeit with more toxicity .
In fact ,  this appears to be the first evidence of an impact of a chemotherapy regimen on PFS in advanced cervix cancer .
