The first UK Medical Research Council (MRC) trial of preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer was a three-arm randomised trial with 824 patients comparing a control (surgery alone) group with a group treated with 20 Gy given in 10 equal fractions and another treated with a single exposure of 5 Gy .
Eligible patients were men or women younger than 80 years who ,  had histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum partially or totally fixed within the pelvis with the lower margin of the tumour within 15 cm of the anal verge ,  were deemed suitable and fit for the proposed treatment and available for regular follow-up ,  were free of disseminated disease (confirmed by clinical and radiological examination) ,  and had had no previous malignant disease .
Two parallel opposed fields 18 cm by 15 cm were positioned to cover the tumour with an adequate proximal margin (normally 5 cm). 20 daily fractions of 2 Gy at the mid-plane central axis of the volume of the tumour were given over 4 weeks .
We intended to enrol 450 patients (with the anticipation of 251 deaths) ,  this sample size would have provided 90% power to detect a 15% increase in the 3-year survival rate (from 35% to 50%) ,  which was thought plausible at the time the trial was designed .
Nine patients received less than the prescribed dose of radiation ,  two received no radiotherapy because they were judged too ill ,  three failed to complete the full treatment because of their deteriorating condition ,  and treatment was stopped early in four patients (ischiorectal abscess and perineal breakdown ,  bowel obstruction ,  a prearranged time for surgery ,  and refusal to continue by the patient) .
The reasons for investigating preoperative radiation therapy were ,  reduction in size of the primary tumour and frequency of regional node metastases before resection ,  a reduction in the frequency of local pelvic recurrence and of distant metastasis from cancer cells released during resection (preoperative treatment can inhibit the proliferation of malignant cells whether they remain local or spread outside the pelvis after radiation) ,  radiation responsiveness of cancer cells may be greater before surgery when they are normally oxygenated than afterwards when they may be hypoxic because of surgical effects on the vasculature ,  and a lower frequency of late radiation enteritis because the small bowel is less likely to be adherent in the pelvis .
