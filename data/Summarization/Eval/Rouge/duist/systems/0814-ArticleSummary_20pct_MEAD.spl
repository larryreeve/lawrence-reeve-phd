Loco-regional and distant relapses contribute to impair the outcome of rectal cancer patients As to the former either pre- or post-operative radiation therapy RT significantly reduce loco-regional recurrence post-operative chemotherapy CT alone or in different combinations with RT is effective in improving both disease-free survival and survival .
The aim of this trial is to assess the effectiveness and toxicity of adjuvant post-operative RT vs combined RT and CT 5-FU plus levamisole in patients with TNM stage II-III resectable rectal cancer pT3-4 pN0 M0 pTl-4 pNl-3 M0. Eligible patients are enrolled within 40 days after surgery in a multicentre randomized clinical trial with two arms: Arm I post-operative RT Arm II post-operative RT and CT 5-FU plus levamisole with stratification by participating institutions .
Within 42 days from surgery patients randomized in Arm I receive RT 50 Gy in daily fractions of 2 Gy 5 days/wk for 5 wk to tumour bed and loco-regional lymph-nodes internal iliac and presacral nodes with four portals LL and AP .
The primary end-point of the study is overall survival and the expected 5-year survival in RT-treated patients is 50 hence 175 patients will be enrolled in each arm to obtain 80 power of the study related to 15 increase of 5-year survival in RTCT treated patients .
As regards toxicity radiodermatitis 8.3 Grade III and diarrhoea 8.3 Grade III were observed in Arm I while radiodermatitis 13.6 Grade III diarrhoea 27.3 Grade III 9.1 Grade IV and leukopaenia 8.3 Grade III occurred in Arm II .
