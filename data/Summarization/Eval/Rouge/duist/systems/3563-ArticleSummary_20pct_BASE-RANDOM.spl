Intestinal anastomosis has been successfully performed for more than 150 years using a variety of techniques ,  materials ,  and devices .
Of these ,  the method that has proven successful in most situations and in the hands of most surgeons has been the two-layer anastomosis using interrupted silk sutures for an outer inverted seromuscular layer and a running absorbable suture for a transmural inner layer .
The only appreciable shortcoming of the two-layer technique is that it is somewhat tedious and time-consuming to perform .
Recently ,  several reports have appeared advocating a single-layer continuous anastomosis using monofilament plastic suture .
All adult patients requiring intestinal anastomosis at Denver Health Medical Center from September 1996 to September 1999 were considered eligible .
Patients requiring anastomosis to the rectum or third or fourth portion of the duodenum were excluded because the single-layer continuous method is awkward when both ends of the bowel cannot be fully mobilized .
The study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board ,  which also granted a waiver of consent because both methods were in common use in our institution and had similar results .
All layers of the bowel wall except the mucosa were incorporated .
Each bite included 4 to 6 mm of the seromuscular wall ,  the larger bites were used at the mesenteric border to ensure an adequate seal .
Anastomotic failure was defined as a fistula documented radiographically or by the finding of a nonabsorbable material (charcoal) draining from the wound after oral administration ,  or a visible disruption of the suture line during reexploration .
The complication of abscess without fistula was also included in the analysis because it is potentially related to the anastomosis .
All data analysis was performed on an IBM-compatible PC using SPSS 10.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc. ,  Chicago) .
For six patients who required more than one anastomosis ,  the same method was used for each anastomosis .
Anastomotic leaks ,  intraabdominal abscesses ,  length of time required for anastomosis ,  length of stay ,  and material costs are shown for both groups in Table 2 .
The ultimate test of the suitability of a technique for intestinal anastomosis is its ability to heal without leakage .
It is not surprising ,  therefore ,  that both Feilding et al and Tuson and Everett found that leakage rates varied significantly between surgeons and tended to be lower with more experienced surgeons .
With the single-layer method ,  less circumferential clearing is required ,  and in many instances no clearance is necessary .
Another surprising finding was the 2-day difference in the mean length of stay .
We did not believe we could realistically enroll this many patients ,  instead ,  a multiinstitutional trial would be necessary .
For these reasons ,  we believe the single-layer continuous anastomosis is superior to the two-layer interrupted technique .
