The GOG #92 multicenter prospective randomized study was designed to determine whether postoperative pelvic radiotherapy following radical hysterectomy and pelvic node dissection would reduce the rate of recurrence and decrease the mortality in Stage IB cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter ,  deep stromal invasion by tumor ,  and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces found on microscopic examination .
Other eligibility criteria for enrollment into the study included normal blood counts ,  normal liver and kidney function ,  absence of genitourinary tract abnormality as determined by intravenous pyelogram ,  renal sonogram ,  or computerized tomography ,  and absence of intercurrent diseases or other conditions that might not permit completion of the study or the required follow-up .
There were 128 (46%) patients with the risk factors of positive CLS and deep one-third stromal invasion ,  65 (23%) had positive CLS ,  middle third stromal invasion and tumor size $2 cm ,  82 (30%) had negative CLS ,  middle or deep third stromal invasion and a $4-cm tumor ,  and 2 (0.7%) had positive CLS ,  superficial stromal invasion ,  and tumor size $5 cm (Table 3) .
However ,  the overall risk for recurrence was very similar in each regimen when all three risk factors were considered as a group (See Cox Model analyses) .
Deep tumor invasion into cervical stroma (measured either in millimeters or in thirds of the total cervical thickness) has been also shown in association withlymph node metastases ,  recurrence ,  and poorer survival .
A detailed GOG clinical pathologic study had established that certain patients with poor prognostic factors related to the primary tumor (i.e. ,  large tumor size ,  deep stromal invasion ,  and capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement) but without lymph node involvement had a risk of recurrence of 31% after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy .
The present prospective randomized study showed that adjunctive radiotherapy significantly reduced the number of cancer recurrences in women with the above risk factors by 44% and that the difference in recurrences between irradiated and nonirradiated patients was statistically significant at the P 5 0.019 level .
In our study ,  major lifethreatening adverse effects were encountered in 5 (4%) womenamong the 128 who received radiotherapy .
