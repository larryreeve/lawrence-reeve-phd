Here ,  we report on the 7-year follow-up study of this prospective randomized two-arm trial in minimal residual disease that used the murine 17-1A antibody ,  4 which recognizes a 34-kd glycoprotein of the cell membrane of epithelial cells.5 The 5-year analysis had shown that a short ,  albeit intensive ,  postoperative course of antibody treatment (900 mg total dose) significantly reduced the appearance of distant metastases ,  but did not affect the rate of local relapses .
When the analyses of recurrence-free interval and recurrence-free survival were performed including all randomized patients ,  ie ,  according to intention-to-treat ,  17-1A treatment again led to significant advantage over the untreated group (Cox multivanate ,  P = .02 ,  log-rank ,  P = .01 ,  respectively) .
