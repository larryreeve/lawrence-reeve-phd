Intestinal anastomosis has been successfully performed for more than 150 years using a variety of techniques ,  materials ,  and devices .
METHODS .
Patients were also excluded if the surgeon did not believe that either technique could be used because of technical concerns such as edema or scarring .
Randomization was performed using random permuted blocks of size 10 .
The study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board ,  which also granted a waiver of consent because both methods were in common use in our institution and had similar results .
All layers of the bowel wall except the mucosa were incorporated .
The time recorded for construction of the anastomosis began with the placement of the first stitch and ended with cutting the excess material from the last stitch .
The complication of abscess without fistula was also included in the analysis because it is potentially related to the anastomosis .
Data were analyzed based on the intention-to-treat principle .
The Fisher exact test and the Pearson chi-square test were used to analyze categorical data .
P < .05 was considered to indicate statistical significance .
All data analysis was performed on an IBM-compatible PC using SPSS 10.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc. ,  Chicago) .
RESULTS .
DISCUSSION .
In the United States ,  the first mention of this technique was by Allen et al , 18 who presented their results with its use before the Texas Surgical Society in 1979 .
In fact ,  the only technique that has been unequivocally demonstrated to be unacceptable is the everted anastomosis .
Further ,  most of the anastomoses in this study were performed by residents ,  who were often unfamiliar with the technique or were performing their first intestinal anastomosis .
The major weakness of the study is its relatively small sample size .
We did not believe we could realistically enroll this many patients ,  instead ,  a multiinstitutional trial would be necessary .
However ,  our results and those in the literature are consistent and reassuring .
