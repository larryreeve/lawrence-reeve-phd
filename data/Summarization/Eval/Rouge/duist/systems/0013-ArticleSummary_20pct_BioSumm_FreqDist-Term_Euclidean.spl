ALTHOUGH MANY PATIENTS with carcinoma of the uterine cervix are cured with local measures ,  a substantial minority recur or present with metastases and are potential candidates for systemic therapy .
DAG is probably an alkylating agent .
Since both drugs have activityin cervical cancer ,  it seemed reasonable to evaluate this combination .
Since there were only 18 assessable patients , the study was too small for definitive conclusions .
PATIENTS AND METHODS .
Written informed consent was obtained before study entry .
Lesions measurable by physical examination or chest x-ray were required .
Therapy was to be delayed week by week until these levels were exceeded .
Toxicity was graded according to standard cooperative group criteria .
Statistical Considerations .
RESULTS .
Toxicity .
In some patients ,  fatigue or weakness was reported and ascribed to chemotherapy .
In that case ,  which occurred early in the trial ,  the patient had a cardiorespiratory arrest while co-matose .
As a result ,  the eligibility criteria for the trial were revised .
There were 34 stage IVB patients ,  of whom 31 had no prior radiotherapy ,  seven of 31 (23%) had a response to protocol chemotherapy .
DISCUSSION .
The C + M regimen was well tolerated ,  but disappointing .
Perhaps that dose of mitolactol is too low to provide an additional effect with cisplatin .
Such a study would be of great interest .
Perhaps this is a step in the right direction ,  albeit with more toxicity .
Fortunately ,  curative local therapy is available when this disease is diagnosed at a much earlier stage .
