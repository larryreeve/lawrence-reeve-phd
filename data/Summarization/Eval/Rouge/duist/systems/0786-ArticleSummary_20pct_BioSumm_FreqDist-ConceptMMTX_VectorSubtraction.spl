RECURRENCE OF rectal cancer in the pelvis after a complete resection represents a major contributor to morbidity and subsequent mortality .
Consequently ,  the GITSG sought to assess the contribution of MeCCNU to the combined modality regimen in study GI 7180 .
An escalating single-agent 5-FU regimen incorporating a theoretical maximum-tolerated dose was chosen as the alternative treatment option based on clinical evidence suggesting a dose response curve for 5-FU and pilot data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggesting added efficacy of 5-FU when given at higher dose levels .
Patients considered eligible received a full explanation of the purpose ,  procedures ,  and risks of the study ,  signed a statement of informed consent approved by the local institutional review board ,  and were then randomized by telephoning a central coordinating center .
For all other patients ,  inclusion of the perineum in the radiation field was at the discretion of the investigator .
After the completion of radiation therapy and 5-FU ,  nochemotherapy was given for 5 weeks .
5-FU and MeCCNU .
Courses were to be repeated at 10-week intervals for a totalof 18 months of treatment .
Escalating 5-FU .
Assessment of Radiation Therapy Quality .
Variations of field placement were also categorized into minor and major clinicaldeviations .
Criteria for Recurrence .
Perineal pain ,  if preceded by a pain-free interval ,  was considered indicative of recurrence ,  and time of recurrence was listed as the time of pain onset .
A major goal was to assess the contribution of MeCCNU to adjuvant benefit .
All patients who died ,  regardless of disease status ,  were counted as events in the survival analysis .
All of these patients are included in the analyses .
Patient Characteristics .
Of the 199 patients who comprised the cohort for primary analysis ,  95 were randomized to receive postradiation 5-FU and MeCCNU ,  and 104 were randomized to receive postradiation escalating 5-FU .
The median age of the 199 patients analyzed was 59 years .
The median follow-up time for the 108 surviving patients is 5.8 years with 3 years of follow-up available for all but five surviving patients .
Patients randomized to 5-FU and MeCCNU received a median total dose of MeCCNU of.37 g/m2 (25% < the planned level of .49 g/m) ,  and a median of .08 g/m of MeCCNU per 10-week course .
Central review of compliance with radiation therapy confirmed that the majority of patients were treated as per protocol ,  with discrepancies occurring equally in each treatment arm .
No patients were excluded from analysis due to deviations from the radiotherapy protocol .
At the time of death the patient's leukocyte count was below 500/UL .
In three patients the small bowel obstruction appeared to occur at an anatomic site remote from the radiation field .
No episodes of acute myeloid leukemia have been reported on either arm of the study .
Of the 96 recurrent patients ,  10 died of disease without adequate documentation and were classified as recurrences by group review .
The probability of 3-year disease-free survival on the two arms is 54% and 68% for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and the escalating 5-FU arm ,  respectively ,  median time to recurrenceis estimated to be 4 years and greater than 4 years ,  respectively (Fig 1) .
After adjustment for these variables ,  the 5-FU and MeCCNU and the escalating 5-FU treatment results remained statistically indistinguishable (P = .30 , two-tailed) .
Mortality .
Six of the deaths unrelated to disease occurred in patients receiving escalating 5-FU and three in patients receiving 5-FU and MeCCNU .
Kaplan-Meier estimates of 3-year survival probabilities for patients assigned to 5-FU and MeCCNU and escalating 5-FU are 66% and 75% ,  respectively (Fig 2) .
DISCUSSION .
The risk to the patient ,  however ,  is balanced by the expected survival benefit .
Progress has clearly been made in the adjuvant treatment of rectal cancer .
The increased leukemicpotential of MeCCNU makes the drug additionally undesirable to include in the adjuvant setting .
Therefore ,  we conclude that MeCCNU is not an essential component of effective postoperative combined modality treatment of adjuvant rectal cancer and should not be included in future treatment regimens .
