Radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea has been compared in separate trials with radiotherapy alone ,  with radiotherapy and concomitant therapy with misonidazole ,  and with radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil (and Whitney CW: unpublished data) .
As compared with radiotherapy alone ,  treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy significantly increased the rate of complete response ,  progression-free survival ,  and overall survival .
As compared with treatment with misonidazole and radiotherapy ,  treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy increased progression-free survival and was less toxic .
However ,  treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and radiotherapy resulted in greater improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival than did treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy (Whitney CW: unpublished data) .
Radiotherapy .
The total dose delivered was 40 Gy in patients with stage IIB and 30 Gy in patients with stage III or IVA disease .
Chemotherapy .
The primary end points were survival and progression-free survival .
The design called for final analysis when disease progression (or death) had occurred in 104 patients receiving the control regimen (radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea) .
Characteristics of the Patients .
From April 1992 to April 1997 ,  575 patients were enrolled: 192 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin; 191 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea; and 192 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with hydroxyurea .
Progression-free Survival .
The relative risk of progression of disease or death was 0.57 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.42 to 0.78) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0.55 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.40 to 0.75) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy ,  after adjustment for the clinical stage of disease .
The rates of progression-free survival at 24 months were 67 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy; 64 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea; and 47 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
Survival .
A total of 205 patients have died (39 percent): 59 in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy; 57 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea; and 89 in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
After adjustment for the clinical stage of disease ,  the relative risk of death was 0.61 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.44 to 0.85) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0.58 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.41 to 0.81) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
Patients in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea had less local progression (19 percent and 20 percent ,  respectively) than those in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy (30 percent) .
Patients in the two cisplatin-treated groups also had a lower frequency of lung metastases (3 percent and 4 percent ,  respectively) than patients treated with hydroxyurea alone (10 percent) .
Chemotherapy .
Radiotherapy .
The number of patients who received within 15 percent of the prescribed total dose to both point A (69 to 93 Gy) and point B (stage IIB ,  47 to 63 Gy; stage III or IVA ,  51 to 59 Gy) was 159 (90 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy; 147 (85 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea; and 149 (84 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
The median duration of treatment was 9.0 weeks (10th and 90th percentiles ,  7.1 and 11.9 ,  respectively) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy; 9.3 weeks (10th and 90th percentiles ,  7.6 and 11.6) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea; and 8.9 weeks (10th and 90th percentiles ,  7.2 and 11.2) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
Adverse Effects .
Pelvic radiotherapy by itself fails to control the progression of cervical cancer in 35 to 90 percent of patients with locally advanced disease .
We found higher rates of survival and progression-free survival among patients who were treated with radiotherapy and either cisplatin alone or cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea than among patients who were treated with radiotherapy and hydroxyurea alone .
Many combinations of cisplatin have been studied in phase 2 trials of patients with cervical cancer .
Souhami et al .
used radiotherapy concurrently with treatment with cisplatin ,  followed by high-dose brachytherapy ,  to treat 50 patients with cervical cancer .
We recommend cisplatin as the standard drug for radiotherapy and chemotherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer .
