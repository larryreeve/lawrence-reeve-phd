Introduction .
Most studies have shown no significant treatment effects ,  and a meta-analysis to test the hypothesis of no effect was unable to dismiss this possibility .
Surgical stress ,  anaesthetics and other drugs ,  hypercoagulability ,  blood transfusions ,  and surgery-induced impairment of immune function are all reasons why the perioperative period is considered a vulnerable phase in which tumour progression is likely .
Patients were randomly assigned no adjuvant treatment (control group) or an immediate postoperative intraportal infusion of 500mg/m fluorouracil plus 5000 units heparin in 1 L 5% glucose per 24 h for 7 consecutive days (days 1-7) plus 10 mg/m mitomycin in a single dose on day 1 .
We excluded 28 patients ,  26 did not have adenocarcinoma (lymphoma ,  ovarian cancer ,  urothelial cancer ,  and others) and in 2 the protocol was violated (radiation therapy to the pelvis was added for rectal cancer) .
Disease-free survival was defined as the time from surgery to relapse ,  the appearance of a second primary cancer ,  or death ,  whichever occurred first .
All the others had observation times of at least 5 years at the time of this analysis .
Therefore ,  5-year disease-free survival and overall survival could be estimated reliably by the Kaplan-Meier method ,  standard errors were calculated with Greenwood’s formula .
In 41 patients (17-4%) treatment was assigned but not given because of surgery-related problems (7) ,  difficulties with catheter placement (7) ,  other technical problems (14) ,  patient refusal (2) ,  and various other reasons (11) .
The group assigned perioperative portal chemotherapy had significantly higher 5-year disease-free survival than the control group (table 2) .
The significant advantage of the infusion over the control arm for both overall and disease-free survival is shown in the figure .
Among node-negative patients ,  local relapses were less frequent in those who received infusion treatment .
Although chemotherapy was started immediately after surgery ,  it had no significant effect on rates of wound infection ,  peritonitis ,  or breakdown of bowel anastomosis .
After median follow-up of 8 years we were notable to confirm the overall reduction of liver metastases reported by Taylor et al. We did find ,  however ,  a consistent reduction of all kinds of tumour recurrences that resulted in a significant advantage in overall survival and disease-free survival for patients  treated with adjuvant portal infusion ,  confirming previous findings .
This effect was observed in all subgroups ,  but was greatest in patients with tumour-involved lymph nodes (33%) and in those with colon cancer (22%) .
The adjuvant treatment was given as a continuous infusion for 5-7 days immediately after operation .
Three controlled trials tested the effects of anticoagulants (heparin or urokinase alone) in a three-arm trial design .
Two as yet unpublished meta-analyses of all randomised trials comparing portal adjuvant chemotherapy with a no-treatment control group have been conducted by the European Organization on Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Oxford Colorectal Cancer Cooperative Group .
However ,  none of the studies couldc onfirm the statistically significant overall effect on the frequency of liver metastases  reported by Taylor et al. It seems likely that the effect of adjuvant portal chemotherapy on overall and disease-free survival can be attributed to the systemic effects of intraportal fluorouracil ,  which lead to a reduction in all tumour relapses (ie ,  local recurrences ,  liver metastases ,  and other distant metastases) .
