The preferred treatment of women with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO IA2–IIA) is radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy .
The overall prognosis for patients undergoing radical hysterectomy is good ,  with reported 5-year survival rates ranging from 75 to 90% .
A retrospective study of patients undergoing radical hysterectomy at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) from 1939 to 1977 identified the following risk factors ,  metastatic tumor to the pelvic lymph nodes ,  large cervical tumor ,  parametrial extension of disease ,  nonsquamous or grade 3 histology ,  and deep (.75%) cervical stromal invasion .
Preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been reported as another approach to management of women with early cervical cancer and high-risk features .
Few reports have utilized adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy alone after radical surgery for invasive cervical cancer .
At each institution ,  the protocol was approved by the institutional review board prior to entry of patients ,  all patients signed an informed consent prior to entry .
Randomization was performed at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center by the Department of Biostatistics using an envelope system .
RESULTS .
All had 1 risk factor .
There were 12 major protocol viola-patients received only a portion of the proscribed treatment ,  tions ,  including 7 patients who were randomized (6 to che-one patient ,  randomized to chemotherapy ,  withdrew after chemotherapy plus radiation therapy and 1 patient to chemother-experiencing an allergic bleomycin reaction during the initial chemotherapy alone) and then either refused treatment (n ?6) or were infusion of bleomycin during cycle 1 .
At a median follow up of 36 months (range 4–81 months) ,  19 patients have planned dose when treatment was stopped due to a severe histologic documentation of recurrent cervical cancer .
DISCUSSION .
group of patients treated with chemotherapy alone .
Toxicity was tolerable in the two treatment arms .
The rationale for adding radiation therapy ,  1 patient received 3780 cGy of 4500 cGy chemotherapy to the pelvic radiation is to provide systemic cytotoxic agents active against cervical cancer with the potential to eradicate micrometastasis .
The closure of this clinical trial prior to completion of the accrual goal was disappointing .
