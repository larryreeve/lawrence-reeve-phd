loco regional and distant relapses contribute to impair theoutcome of rectal cancer patients as to the former eitherpre or post operative radiation therapy rt significantlyreduce loco regional recurrence post operative chemotherapy ct alone or in different combinations with rt is effective in improving both disease free survival andsurvival 
within 42 days from surgery patients randomized in arm i receive rt 50 gy in daily fractions of 2 gy 5 days wk for 5 wk to tumour bed and loco regional lymph nodes internal iliac and presacral nodes with four portals ll and ap 
up to now two and seven relapses respectively have been observed in arms i and ii two and three patients respectively have died in arms i and ii 
the aim of this trial is to assess the effectiveness and toxicityof adjuvant post operative rt vs combined rt and ct 5 fu plus levamisole in patients with tnm stage ii iiiresectable rectal cancer pt3 4 pn0 m0 ptl 4 pnl 3 m0 
the primary end point of the study is overall survival and the expected 5 year survival in rt treated patients is 50 hence 175 patients will be enrolled in each arm to obtain 80 power of the study related to 15 increase of 5 year survival in rt ct treated patients 
no significant differences as regards sex age performance states type of operation sphincter saving resection or abdominoperineal excision of the rectum pt pn stages of disease number of sampled lymph nodes and grading were observed in 76 and 73 patients randomized in arms i and ii respectively
