The preferred treatment of women with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO IA2–IIA) is radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy .
The procedure is well tolerated ,  with minimal associated morbidity and rare mortality .
The overall prognosis for patients undergoing radical hysterectomy is good ,  with reported 5-year survival rates ranging from 75 to 90% .
A retrospective study of patients undergoing radical hysterectomy at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) from 1939 to 1977 identified the following risk factors ,  metastatic tumor to the pelvic lymph nodes ,  large cervical tumor ,  parametrial extension of disease ,  nonsquamous or grade 3 histology ,  and deep (.75%) cervical stromal invasion .
There have been multiple studies published which have retrospectively analyzed the outcome of patients at risk for recurrence who received adjuvant therapy compared to those patients not receiving adjuvant therapy .
Preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been reported as another approach to management of women with early cervical cancer and high-risk features .
Few reports have utilized adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy alone after radical surgery for invasive cervical cancer .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Randomization was performed at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center by the Department of Biostatistics using an envelope system .
The alternative hypothesis considered that chemotherapy alone would result in a 5-year disease-free survival of 20% less or 50% (significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80) .
RESULTS .
All had 1 risk factor .
DISCUSSION .
group of patients treated with chemotherapy alone .
This finding is somewhat surprising since there was no apparent effect of the addition of pelvic radiation to the treatment regimen .
The closure of this clinical trial prior to completion of the accrual goal was disappointing .
