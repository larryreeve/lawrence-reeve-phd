Purpose .
Adjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma is controversial because previous trials reported conflicting results .
The present study was designed with restricted selection criteria and high dose-intensities of the two most active chemotherapeutic agents .
Patients and Methods .
Patients between 18 and 65 years of age with grade 3 to 4 spindle-cell sarcomas (primary diameter >= 5 cm or any size recurrent tumor) in extremities or girdles were eligible .
Stratification was by primary versus recurrent tumors and by tumor diameter greater than or equal to 10 cm versus less than 10 cm. One hundred four patients were randomized ,  51 to the control group and 53 to the treatment group (five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin 60 mg/m2 days 1 and 2 and ifosfamide 1.8 g/m2 days 1 through 5 ,  with hydration ,  mesna ,  and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) .
Results .
After a median follow-up of 59 months ,  60 patients had relapsed and 48 died (28 and 20 in the treatment arm and 32 and 28 in the control arm ,  respectively) .
The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 48 months in the treatment group and 16 months in the control group (P = .04) ,  and the median overall survival (OS) was 75 months for treated and 46 months for untreated patients (P = .03) .
For OS ,  the absolute benefit deriving from chemotherapy was 13% at 2 years and increased to 19% at 4 years (P = .04) .
Conclusion .
Intensified adjuvant chemotherapy had a positive impact on the DFS and OS of patients with high-risk extremity soft tissue sarcomas at a median follow-up of 59 months .
Therefore ,  our data favor an intensified treatment in similar cases .
Although cure is still difficult to achieve ,  a significant delay in death is worthwhile ,  also considering the short duration of treatment and the absence of toxic deaths .
SOFT TISSUE sarcomas represent less than 1% of all malignant tumors and derive from the mesenchymal tissues present in the whole human body .
However ,  the vast majorities arise from the extra-osseous and subcutaneous soft tissue of the limbs .
Their natural history is partially known and clinical decisions rely on a few simple and well-recognized prognostic factors such as size ,  grading ,  and location .
The treatment of limb sarcomas mainly relies on a combined-modality approach ,  after the demonstration that pre-or postoperative radiation and conservative surgery led to local control in a high proportion of patients.4 In fact ,  limb-sparing procedures allow an 85% to 90% local dis-ease-free survival (DFS) rate and demolitive surgery now represents only 5% to 10% of the operations in comparison with the 50% survival rate of the 1960s to 1970s .
Nevertheless ,  a great proportion of high-risk soft tissue sarcoma patients develop distant metastases during their lives .
In the early 1960s ,  this clinical behaviour prompted the introduction of adjuvant chemotherapy trials with the aim of increasing DFS and possibly overall survival (OS) .
The first generation of randomized adjuvant trials have recently been reviewed and a meta-analysis performed on the basis of updated patient records .
The main findings were statistical evidence in favor of chemotherapy for local ,  metastasis ,  and overall DFS (P = .016 ,  .0003 ,  and .0001 ,  respectively) and a trend towards increased OS (P = .12) .
However ,  in the subgroup of extremity sarcomas ,  OS was also statistically increased after chemotherapy (P = .029) .
A second generation of randomized ,  control-based ,  adjuvant trials started in the early 1990s .
Their main differences ,  compared with the previous studies ,  are the introduction of ifosfamide (IFO) and the intensification of doses in combination with hematopoietic growth factors ,  and more restricted selection criteria .
Not one new study has been already reported ,  whereas the present Italian co-operative study closed patient accrual in November 1996 because of the results of the planned interim analysis .
Here we report the results of the Italian co-operative study after a median follow-up of 59 months and a minimum time between randomization and date last seen of 28 months among patients who did not die .
The time of the analysis (November ,  1999) was 36 months after the last randomization .
This time of analysis was chosen because it is generally agreed to be the period in which the great majority of events appear in a patient population with high-risk extremity sarcomas .
PATIENTS AND METHODS .
Study Design and Staging .
After a positive biopsy for sarcoma ,  all patients underwent complete staging and programmed local treatment .
The patients who satisfied all the selection criteria were then stratified and subsequently randomized to a control or chemotherapy group .
Treatment started after the completion of any local treatment and/or as soon as the wound had healed (Fig 1) .
All the patients gave their informed written consent before the randomization .
The staging consisted of a computed tomography (CT) scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging of the primary lesion ,  and a CT scan of the thorax ,  other specific tests (angiography ,  bone scan ,  CT scan of the brain ,  and so on) were performed only in the case of clinical suspicion .
Selection Criteria .
Inclusion criteria were as follows ,  age ,  18 to 65 years ,  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2 ,  primary tumors subfascially localized with diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm ,  high-grade spindle-cell or polymorphous sarcomas (fibrosarcoma ,  malignant fibrous histiocytoma ,  polymorphous liposarcoma ,  leiomyosarcoma ,  synovial sarcoma ,  malignant schwannoma ,  angiosarcoma ,  and polymorphous rhabdomyosarcoma) ,  local relapse of any size ,  no previous radio/chemotherapy ,  adequate bone marrow (WBC count of >= 4,000/fiL ,  platelets = 120.000/mL ,  and hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL) ,  renal (creatinine <= 1.3 mg/dL) ,  hepatic (SGOT <= 2.5 X normal value and bilirubin <= 1.2 mg/dL) ,  and pulmonary functions .
Exclusion criteria were as follows ,  distant or regional lymph-node metastases ,  previous malignancy ,  medical or psychiatric illness precluding correct written informed consent ,  pregnancy ,  uncontrolled infections ,  and risk of being lost to follow-up .
