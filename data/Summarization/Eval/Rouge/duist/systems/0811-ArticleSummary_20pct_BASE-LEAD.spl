ADVANCED colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common oncologic challenges encountered in the Western world .
Nevertheless ,  there is little evidence of effective therapy for such patients other than symptomatic and supportive care. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is considered by many as the standard of chemotherapy ,  but in larger experiences with this agent ,  response rates have only been in the 15% to 20% range .
These responses are usually partial ,  sometimes questionable ,  and generally very transient .
To date there has been no convincing evidence that any chemotherapy of colorectal cancer contributes to either the duration or the quality of life .
Although a large number of alternative drugs have been studied in colorectal cancer ,  none has exceeded the meager effectiveness of 5-FU .
A hope frequently pursued in clinical research has been that the activity of 5-FU can be enhanced either by adding the activity of other cytotoxic drugs or ,  more recently ,  by favorably modulating the effects of 5-FU itself .
Although enhanced activity by such methods has occasionally been suggested in pilot studies or in phase 2 trials ,  these claims have seldom been substantiated by the essential definitive study-a randomized comparison with 5-FU used alone .
The purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate ,  by such a randomized and controlled comparison ,  a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5-FU activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials .
We chose for our evaluation the combinations of 5- FU with thymidine ,  with N-(phosphonacetyl)-Laspartic acid (PALA) ,  with levamisole ,  and with methyl CCNU ,  vincristine ,  and streptozotocin (MOF-Strept) .
Thymidine given at high doses in animal model systems has been shown to increase both therapeutic activity and toxicity of 5-FU and to improve the therapeutic index of this agent .
These effects presumably occur through the action of thymidine in blocking oxidative metabolism of 5-FU and increasing 5-FU incorporation into RNA .
Rustum demonstrated in colon 26 tumor and in a transplanted colon tumor in rats that thymidine plus 5-FU produced a significant prolongation of survival time when compared with 5-FU alone .
Studies by Woodcock et al ,  by Kirkwood and Frei ,  and by Vogel et a1 demonstrated that in humans ,  pretreatment with thymidine increased the biologic activity of 5-FU up to eight-fold as measured by hematologic toxicity .
In the study of Woodcock et al ,  the single colorectal cancer patient treated who was not a prior 5-FU failure had a response of 8 months duration .
They also observed one additional response among patients who had failed 5-FU .
In the study of Vogel et al ,  two of five previously untreated colorectal cancer patients responded for 4 + and 7 months .
PALA is a potent inhibitor of aspartate transcarbamylase and has a broad spectrum of activity in animal model tumor screens .
In human trials the dose-limiting toxicities were mucocutaneous reactions with minimal hematologic effects .
Overall therapeutic results were discouraging ,  specifically in colorectal cancer ,  a Mayo Clinic study demonstrated only one response among 30 patients ,  a study of the Baltimore Cancer Research Program showed no responses among 21 patients ,  and a New York Memorial study demonstrated only two minor responses among 19 evaluated patients .
Continued interest in PALA ,  however ,  was stimulated by animal model evidence that this agent inhibits pyrimidine synthesis and thereby enhances 5-FU activity by increasing its conversion to fluorouridine monophosphate (FUMP) .
Synergistic activity with the PALA-5-FU combination was demonstrated in murine tumor systems .
Pilot and phase 2 trials of this combination in humans showed the dose-limiting toxicity to be mucocutaneous effects .
In the phase 2 trial of Bedikian et al ,  a relatively discouraging 14% response rate was recorded among 50 patients ,  but an additional 54% were stated to have achieved "disease stabilization." .
Levamisole is an agent that has been used extensively to treat parasitic infections in man and domestic animals .
It has also been shown to have immunomodulatory effects .
Two randomized ,  controlled studies have raised the possibility that it may have some role in the treatment of colorectal carcinoma .
The first was a small surgical adjuvant study reported by Verhaegen et al in which levamisole-treated patients had a significantly improved survival when compared with untreated controls .
The second study ,  conducted at the University of Wisconsin (Madison) ,  showed that advanced-disease patients treated with combined 5-FU and levamisole lived significantly longer than patients treated with 5-FU alone .
If this result could be confirmed it would be the first time that any regimen has demonstrated such significant survival improvement for advanced colorectal cancer in randomized trials .
In 1981 ,  a New York Memorial study reported a 32% objective response rate among 77 patients treated with MOF-Strept .
In a randomized trial ,  this group showed that this combination produced superior response rates and survival when compared with their own variant of the 5-FU ,  methyl CCNU ,  vincristine combination .
In contrast ,  however ,  the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group reported only a 4% response rate among 41 patients treated with MOF-Strept and they discouraged further use of this combination .
