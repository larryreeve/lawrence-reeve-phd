Stage Ib and IIa carcinoma of the cervix can be cured by radical surgery or radiotherapy with similar effectiveness ,  but the rate and types of complications differ .
Radiotherapy is feasible and effective in almost all patients ,  5-year survival after this therapy ranges from 78% to 91% .
Apart from Newton’s study about stage-I diseases ,  there have been no randomised studies to compare radiotherapy with radical surgery in one institution over a short period of time .
Eligibility criteria were ,  age 30–70 years ,  newly diagnosed stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  no concurrent or previous malignant disease ,  WHO performance status of 1 or less ,  and feasibility of both radical surgery and radiotherapy .
The patients were randomly assigned radical surgery (n=172) or radical radiotherapy (n=171) .
Radiotherapy included ,  external pelvic irradiation with 18 MV photon beam by the multiportal technique ,  one dose of 1·8–2·0Gy at the isocentre ,  and two or more portals treated daily .
We classified complications as ,  grade 1 ,  mild symptoms not affecting the patient’s health and easily cured ,  grade 2 ,  symptoms that can be resolved by long-term medical therapies ,  grade 3 ,  major symptoms that require surgery or invasive procedures and affect the performance status of the patient ,  or fatal complications .
Of the 468 patients with FIGO stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  125 were excluded because of age (<30 years ,  >70 years ,  n=43) ,  medical illness (n=54) ,  previous or concurrent malignant disease (n=21) ,  or the referring physician’s or patient’s preference for surgery ,  radiotherapy ,  or chemoradiotherapy (n=7) .
After randomisation ,  there were six protocol violations ,  two in the surgery group (one progression before operation and one refusal of any therapy after randomisation) and four in the radiotherapy group (two patients whose cancer was incorrectly staged and two with synchronous neoplasia) .
Ten patients crossed over treatment ,  one refused surgery and was irradiated ,  and nine refused radiotherapy and underwent surgery .
Lymphangiography revealed positive nodes in 24 (14%) surgery-group patients and in 22 (13%) radiotherapy group patients .
The overall and disease-free actuarial 5-year survival for all patients were 83% and 74% ,  respectively ,  and did not differ significantly between the groups (figure 2). 5-year actuarial survival stratified by cervical diameter was similar in the surgery and radiotherapy groups (diameter < 4 cm ,  87% vs 90% ,  diameter >4 cm ,  70% vs 72% ,  figure 3 ,  table 3). 5-year actuarial disease-free survival for the surgery and radiotherapy groups was 80% and 82% ,  respectively ,  for patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or smaller ,  and 63% and 57% for those with a diameter larger than 4 cm ,  the between group differences were not significant .
For rates of adenocarcinoma there was a significant advantage for patients who had surgery compared with those who had radiotherapy in both overall survival (70% vs 59% ,  p=0·05) and disease-free survival (66% vs 47% ,  p=0·02) .
The median time to recurrence did not differ significantly between the surgery and radiotherapy groups (20 vs 18 months ,  p=0·24). 82% of pelvic recurrences and 61% of the distant ones became evident within 2 years of the primary treatment .
In addition ,  among women with a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm ,  there was a significantly higher rate of pelvic relapse among those who had radiotherapy than among those who had surgery plus adjuvant irradiation (16 [70%] vs 9 [53%] ,  p=0·46) .
Three (1·7%) surgery-group patients had perioperative complications ,  one vascular lesion during lymphadenectomy ,  one postoperative ureterovaginal fistula ,  and one fatal pulmonary embolism .
Hydroureteronephrosis was recorded in ,  two (3%) of 61 patients who had surgery alone ,  11 (10%) of 108 patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy ,  and eight (5%) of 158 patients who had radiotherapy alone (p=0·1) .
The relative risk of this complication for surgery plus radiotherapy versus surgery alone was 3·11 (95% CI 0·71–13·56) and was 2·01 (95% CI 0·84–4·8%) for surgery plus radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone .
Chronic neurological bladder was observed in eight (13%) patients who had surgery alone and in five (5%) patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy .
Other vesical complications (severe actinic cystitis ,  stress incontinence ,  high-pressure bladder) were recorded in two (3%) patients after surgery ,  11 (10%) after surgery plus radiotherapy ,  and in eight (5%) after radiotherapy alone .
Ileal obstruction occurred in six (5%) patients who underwent surgery plus radiotherapy and in two (1%) who received radical radiotherapy .
In the radiotherapy group ,  one patient had intestinal perforation ,  one rectovaginal fistula ,  and 12 severe proctites.Severe oedema of the legs occurred in ten (9%) patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy ,  in one (0·6%) patient who had radiotherapy alone ,  and in none of the patients who had surgery alone .
Pelvic lymphocyst occurred in five (8%) patients after surgery and in five (15%) after surgery plus radiotherapy .
Abdominal hernia occurred in seven patients ,  of whom four received surgery alone and three received surgery plus radiotherapy .
Our review of the published research suggests that cure rates are similar for patients with stage-I cervical cancers who undergo surgery or radiotherapy .
Surgery also offers other advantages ,  pelvic relapses can be successfully cured by radiotherapy ,  whereas salvage surgery after primary irradiation carries a high rate of failures and severe morbidity .
By contrast ,  radiotherapy is easier to deliver for patients who are obese ,  are elderly ,  or have severe illness—major contraindications to the surgical approach .
Radiotherapy also avoids the risks of anaesthesia and the laparotomy scar ,  and iatrogenic mortality is rare .
Hydroureteronephroses ,  oedema of the lower limbs ,  various vesical complications ,  and bowel morbidity are more common and compromising in women who undergo surgery plus radiotherapy .
