ADVANCED colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common oncologic challenges encountered in the Western world .
These effects presumably occur through the action of thymidine in blocking oxidative metabolism of 5-FU and increasing 5-FU incorporation into RNA .
Rustum demonstrated in colon 26 tumor and in a transplanted colon tumor in rats that thymidine plus 5-FU produced a significant prolongation of survival time when compared with 5-FU alone .
In human trials the dose-limiting toxicities were mucocutaneous reactions with minimal hematologic effects .
It has also been shown to have immunomodulatory effects .
A radioactive liver scan could be used to document a measurable lesion if there was a clearly defined perfusion defect measuring at least 5 cm in greatest diameter .
On day I. 5-FU was administered 4 hours after PALA .
These courses were repeated every 5 weeks .
Streptozotocin was administered by rapid IV injection at a dose of 500 mg/m2 on day I and every 7 days thereafter .
Treatment was continued until disease progression was documented .
Evaluation of Results .
For the comparison of any one of our drug combinations with 5-FU. this would permit our test for treatment effect to have .90 probability of detecting a true doubling in survival time (eg. from 6 to 12 months). while having only a .05 probability of obtaining a false-positive result when there were no true differences in survival .
It was required that this result be observed at least 4 weeks after the onset of therapy ,  but there was no requirement for duration of response .
P values were two-sided .
Early termination did not occur .
Thus ,  essentially no adjustment of the P values given below is required .
RESULTS .
A total of 347 patients were randomized on this study .
The entries of two patients were cancelled after randomization ,  and ten patients were found to be ineligible .
A total of 335 eligible patients were properly started on therapy and are included in the analysis below .
The toxic reactions experienced according to treatment arm and severity are documented in Table 2 .
These reactions were primarily headache (seven patients) ,  lethargy (four patients) ,  dizziness with ataxia (four patients) ,  and occasional confusion (two patients) .
One patient died in irreversible coma .
There were also nine patients who experienced transient hypotension following drug administration .
The intervals to disease progression are shown in Fig 1 .
There is no reasonable possibility that a 50% (4 month) increase in survival could be obtained for any regimen in comparison with 5-FU alone .
This was confirmed by a stratified Cox analysis ,  adjusting for key prognostic covariates ,  which indicated that the data were inconsistent with any combination regimen yielding a 50% increase in survival relative to 5-FU (ie ,  a hazard ratio of 1 .5) ,  wherefore 5-FU plus PALA ,  P < .01 ,  5-FU plus thymidine ,  P < .0001 ,  5-FU plus levamisole ,  P < .01 ,  and MOF-Strept ,  P < .05 .
In each of the regimens we tested ,  drug dosages and scheduling were admittedly largely arbitrary .
It is entirely possible that different proportionate representation of drug dosages or different scheduling could produce more favorable or less favorable results than we observed .
Our results were disappointing .
One cannot conclude that this regimen added to the quality of patient life ,  and since it did not add to duration of life ,  we must conclude that this regimen has little to recommend it .
We would hope this could be done more successfully with increasing knowledge of how best to apply the results of experimental models in the clinical settings .
