ALTHOUGH MANY PATIENTS with carcinoma of the uterine cervix are cured with local measures ,  a substantial minority recur or present with metastases and are potential candidates for systemic therapy .
DAG is probably an alkylating agent .
The principal toxicity of mitolactol is hematologic ,  while that of cisplatin is nonhematologic .
The combination of DAG and cisplatin has previously been studied .
Since there were only 18 assessable patients , the study was too small for definitive conclusions .
PATIENTS AND METHODS .
Written informed consent was obtained before study entry .
Lesions measurable by physical examination or chest x-ray were required .
Statistical Considerations .
The design for this study was based on the assumption that a 15% increase in the response rate due to the addition of either mitolactolor ifosfamide to cisplatin would be regarded as clinically meaningful .
RESULTS .
Toxicity .
In some patients ,  fatigue or weakness was reported and ascribed to chemotherapy .
As a result ,  the eligibility criteria for the trial were revised .
Response and Survival .
There were 34 stage IVB patients ,  of whom 31 had no prior radiotherapy ,  seven of 31 (23%) had a response to protocol chemotherapy .
DISCUSSION .
The C + M regimen was well tolerated ,  but disappointing .
The pilot study on which the C +M arm of the present trial was based identified 180 mg/m for 5 days as the maximum-tolerated dose in combination with cisplatin .
Perhaps that dose of mitolactol is too low to provide an additional effect with cisplatin .
Such a study would be of great interest .
Fortunately ,  curative local therapy is available when this disease is diagnosed at a much earlier stage .
