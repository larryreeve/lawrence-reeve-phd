A retrospective study of patients undergoing radical hysterectomy at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) from 1939 to 1977 identified the following risk factors ,  metastatic tumor to the pelvic lymph nodes ,  large cervical tumor ,  parametrial extension of disease ,  nonsquamous or grade 3 histology ,  and deep (.75%) cervical stromal invasion .
Whole pelvic postoperative radiation therapy has been found to possibly decrease the incidence of local/regional recurrence with little or no effect on overall survival .
Patients with clinical Stage IB–IIA cancer of the uterine cervix treated by radical hysterectomy ,  bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy ,  and aortic lymph node sampling were eligible for entry into this prospective study if they had one or more of the following risk factors ,  (1) metastatic disease to pelvic lymph nodes ,  (2) large primary tumors greater than or equal to 4 cm in diameter ,  (3) deeply invasive lesions with 75% or greater stromal invasion ,  (4) nonsquamous histology ,  and/or (5) occult parametrial involvement or positive surgical margins .
In the second arm of the study ,  patients were randomized to treatment with a similar regimen of chemotherapy as described above without pelvic radiation ,  following the first two cycles of cisplatin and bleomycin ,  the patient then received the third and fourth treatment of cisplatin alone at 3-to 4-week intervals .
Additional entry criteria included histologic confirmation of negative para-aortic lymph nodes ,  normal renal function (creatinine clearance of greater than 60 ml/min) ,  normal liver function tests ,  hemoglobin of greater than 8.0 g/dl ,  and a normal DLCO pulmonary function test .
The null hypothesis considered that the two treatment arms ,  chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy plus radiation ,  would both result in 5-year disease-free survival of 70% .
Seventy-five patients had a Stage IB cervical cancer risk factors and 64 had 1 to 2 risk factors ,  33 of these patients and the remaining 14 patients had a Stage IIA cancer .
Forty-five patients were randomized to the chemotherapy withdrawn by the institutional principal investigator due to plus radiation therapy treatment arm and 44 patients received poor medical condition of the patient (n ? 1) .

Tattersall et al. were unable to demonstrate a difference in disease-free or overall survival in 71 patients randomized to either pelvic radiation versus chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation after radical hysterectomy for Stage IB–IIA cervical cancer .
The investigators hope that future cooperative group trials will consider a chemotherapy-only treatment arm in any studies addressing the role of adjuvant therapy after radical hysterectomy for patients at high risk for recurrence .
Additionally ,  if the patient does experience a local or regional recurrence after chemotherapy ,  pelvic radiation therapy still has curative potential .
