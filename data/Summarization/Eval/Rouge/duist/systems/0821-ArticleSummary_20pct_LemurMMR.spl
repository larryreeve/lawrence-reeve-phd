the antimetabolites methotrexate mtx and 5 fluorouracil 5 fu have become established over the past quarter century among the most useful cancer chemotherapeutic agents 
survival duration was not significantly different by treatment sequence in univariate analyses though the trend favored the sequence of 5 fu before mtx in which the median survival had not been reached at 23 months compared to a median survival of 13 3 months in the group receiving mtx before 5 fu 
the sequential exposure of l1210 cells to mtx and then to 5 fu was shown to increase the intracellular concentration of 5 fu ribonucleotides a potential mechanism of synergy 
because the question at issue was the sequence of drug administration rather than the study of a particular tumor type we chose to include patients with sccs of the head and neck colorectal or gastric adenocarcinoma and other sccs reasonably treated by either mtx or 5 fu 
to our knowledge these are the only prospective randomized clinical trials yet reported that test the importance of the sequence of administration of 5 fu and mtx 
sequential administration of moderate doses of mtx followed by 5 fu has been reported effective in advanced head and neck cancer and colorectal cancer as well as breast cancer but the importance of the sequence remains uncertain 
since this trial was commenced it has been suggested that the optimal time delay for sequence dependent synergy of mtx and 5 fu in human cancer cell lines may be longer than the one hour used in the present study 
biochemical and cell culture results from this laboratory suggested that the sequence dependent synergy observed in vitro between mtx and 5 fu was reduced in the presence of 1 3 umol l hypoxanthine a physiologic level found in human plasma 
browman et al have conducted a similar trial in which patients with head and neck cancer were randomized to receive mtx followed one hour later by 5 fu or the same two drugs given simultaneously 
we thought it important to perform this interim analysis of efficacy and toxicity in view of the theoretical possibility that the sequence of 5 fu followed by mtx might prove antagonistic 
central telephone randomization used balanced blocks stratified only by primary site to assign one of two treatment sequences either mtx followed one hour later by 5 fu mf or 5 fu followed 
this observation cast doubt on the clinical relevance of the sequence of administration of mtx and 5 fu 
in either case the dose of mtx was 250 mg m2 and the dose of 5 fu was 600 mg m2 
mtx has been widely used as a single agent for treatment of head and neck cancer while 5 fu is a major drug for treatment of advanced colorectal and gastric cancer 
we therefore conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial in which sequential mtx followed by 5 fu was compared to the same drugs given in the opposite order 
our results and those of browman et al do not support reports of superior efficacy for the sequential administration of mtx followed by 5 fu compared to other drug sequences 
the results do not support reports based on uncontrolled studies that sequential administration of mtx before 5 fu is important to the efficacy of this combination
