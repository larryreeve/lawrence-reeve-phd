The ability of radiotherapy to cure locally advanced cervical cancer is limited by the size of the tumor ,  because the doses required to treat large tumors exceed the limit of toxicity in normal tissue .
Concurrent chemotherapy inhibits the repair of sublethal damage from radiation ,  synchronizes cells to a particularly radiosensitive phase of the cell cycle ,  and is cytotoxic in vitro .
Therefore ,  we undertook a randomized study in which all women with locally advanced cervical cancer received local radiation as well as weekly concomitant treatment with cisplatin alone ,  the combination of cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  or hydroxyurea alone .
Women with untreated invasive squamous-cell carcinoma ,  adenosquamous carcinoma ,  or adenocarcinoma of the cervix of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIB (localized disease with parametrial involvement) ,  stage III (extension of the tumor to the pelvic wall) ,  or stage IVB (involvement of the bladder or rectal mucosa) were enrolled in the study from April 1992 to April 1997 .
Other eligibility criteria were as follows ,  a leukocyte count of at least 3000 per cubic millimeter ,  a platelet count of at least 100,000 per cubic millimeter ,  a serum creatinine level of no more than 2.0 mg per deciliter (177 umol per liter) ,  a serum bilirubin level that was no more than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal at the institution where it was measured ,  and a serum aspartate aminotransferase level that was no more than 3 times the upper limit of normal at the institution where it was measured .
Radiotherapy was administered to the whole pelvic region in 24 fractions totaling 40.8 Gy or 30 fractions totaling 51.0 Gy ,  followed one to three weeks later by intracavitary brachytherapy (the insertion of a radioactive implant) .
Pelvic radiation was delivered by anteroposterior and posteroanterior parallel ports or a four-field box technique (anteroposterior ,  posteroanterior ,  and two lateral fields) with an x-ray energy of at least 4-MV photons .
Radiotherapy was withheld if a patient had a leukocyte count of less than 2000 per cubic millimeter ,  and delays of up to one week were also allowed in the event of radiation-related gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicity .
The length of delays in radiotherapy ,  in days ,  was calculated by subtracting the planned duration of radiotherapy (the number of prescribed fractions plus 2 weekend days for every five fractions plus 10 days for each implant) from the actual duration of radiotherapy .
Randomization was carried out by a block arrangement ,  the treatment assignments were stratified according to center and the three clinical stages of disease ,  with approximately equal numbers assigned to each treatment group .
Interim analyses were conducted in May 1994 ,  November 1995 ,  and November 1996 with the use of prespecified critical values (11.1 ,  10.6 ,  and 10.6 ,  respectively) for the log-rank test with two degrees of freedom .
Forty-nine of these patients (9 percent) were subsequently found to be ineligible for the following reasons ,  because of deviations from the surgical protocol for the evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (44 patients) ,  ineligible stage of disease (2) ,  metastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes (1) ,  incorrect primary diagnosis (1) ,  and incomplete pretreatment testing (1) .
The relative risk of progression of disease or death was 0.57 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.42 to 0.78) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0.55 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.40 to 0.75) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy ,  after adjustment for the clinical stage of disease .
A multiple regression analysis of progression-free survival was performed that included the prognostic variables identified by Stehman et al ,  clinical stage of disease ,  tumor size as assessed by physical examination ,  status of pelvic lymph nodes ,  age at diagnosis ,  and performance status .
The number of patients who received within 15 percent of the prescribed total dose to both point A (69 to 93 Gy) and point B (stage IIB ,  47 to 63 Gy ,  stage III or IVA ,  51 to 59 Gy) was 159 (90 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  147 (85 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 149 (84 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
The median delay was 8 days (the 10th percentile was a time 2 days ahead of schedule ,  and the 90th percentile was a delay of 22 days) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  10 days (10th and 90th percentiles ,  1 and 26) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 8 days (10th and 90th percentiles ,  1 day ahead of schedule and a delay of 23 days) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
The frequencies of both grade 3 and grade 4 leukopenia in the group given radio-therapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea were more than double the frequencies in the other two groups (P<0.001) .
In our study ,  the rate of local recurrences was significantly lower with either cisplatin-based regimen than with the hydroxyurea regimen ,  whereas the rate of distant recurrences ,  specifically in the lungs ,  was only slightly less .
However ,  in a small study of 45 patients with cervical cancer ,  radiotherapy and chemotherapy with cisplatin (25 mg per square meter per week) increased the rate of local control by 35 percent (P<0.025 for the comparison with radiotherapy alone) ,  but there was no long-term improvement in survival .
In a phase 3 trial conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group ,  388 patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy either with cisplatin and fluorouracil or with hydroxyurea (Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) ,  the two-drug regimen improved survival (relative risk of death ,  0.74 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.58 to 0.95) .
In the phase 3 study by Morris et al. ,  whose results are reported in this issue of the Journal ,  radiotherapy in combination with treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil significantly improved the rates of disease-free survival and overall survival among women with stage IB through IVA cervical cancer .
Adverse urologic effects have occurred in mice treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy with cisplatin ,  but increased rates of urologic complications were not observed in our study .
