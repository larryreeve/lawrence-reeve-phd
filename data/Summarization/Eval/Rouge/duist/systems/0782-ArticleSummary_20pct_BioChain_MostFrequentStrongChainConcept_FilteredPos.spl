Introduction .
Adjuvant chemotherapy of colorectal cancer has been tested in several randomised trials .
Most studies have shown no significant treatment effects ,  and a meta-analysis to test the hypothesis of no effect was unable to dismiss this possibility .
More evidence has emerged lately ,  however ,  that adjuvant chemotherapy of colon cancer may be beneficial .
Patients were randomly assigned no adjuvant treatment (control group) or an immediate postoperative intraportal infusion of 500mg/m fluorouracil plus 5000 units heparin in 1 L 5% glucose per 24 h for 7 consecutive days (days 1-7) plus 10 mg/m mitomycin in a single dose on day 1 .
Disease-free survival was defined as the time from surgery to relapse ,  the appearance of a second primary cancer ,  or death ,  whichever occurred first .
Therefore ,  5-year disease-free survival and overall survival could be estimated reliably by the Kaplan-Meier method ,  standard errors were calculated with Greenwood’s formula .
In 41 patients (17-4%) treatment was assigned but not given because of surgery-related problems (7) ,  difficulties with catheter placement (7) ,  other technical problems (14) ,  patient refusal (2) ,  and various other reasons (11) .
The group assigned perioperative portal chemotherapy had significantly higher 5-year disease-free survival than the control group (table 2) .
The significant advantage of the infusion over the control arm for both overall and disease-free survival is shown in the figure .
Among node-negative patients ,  local relapses were less frequent in those who received infusion treatment .
This trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase survival in patients with colorectal cancer .
Adjuvant portal chemotherapy was tolerated without an increase in complications compared with untreated patients .
After median follow-up of 8 years we were notable to confirm the overall reduction of liver metastases reported by Taylor et al. We did find ,  however ,  a consistent reduction of all kinds of tumour recurrences that resulted in a significant advantage in overall survival and disease-free survival for patients  treated with adjuvant portal infusion ,  confirming previous findings .
Adjuvant chemotherapy reduced the risk of recurrence by 21 % and the risk of death by 26% .
The adjuvant treatment was given as a continuous infusion for 5-7 days immediately after operation .
Previous investigations ,  with the exception of one ,  have shown improvements in overall and disease-free survival  and a reduction in the frequency of liver recurrences ,  especially in the subgroups of colon  cancer patients and of those with tumour-involved regional lymph nodes (Dukes C) .
Two as yet unpublished meta-analyses of all randomised trials comparing portal adjuvant chemotherapy with a no-treatment control group have been conducted by the European Organization on Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Oxford Colorectal Cancer Cooperative Group .
Both analyses are based on data for more than 3000 patients ,  the results show a  statistically significant overall and disease-free survival advantage for patients who received portal adjuvant therapy .
