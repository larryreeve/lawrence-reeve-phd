SINCE JUNE 1973 ,  the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of CMF (cyclophosphamide ,  methotrexate ,  and fluorouracil) chemotherapy were evaluated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes .
Among the numerous questions to be answered by current adjuvant studies is the optimal duration of treatment .
For this reason ,  in September 1975 ,  we started a new prospective study with the intent to evaluate the possibility of reducing the duration of adjuvant CMF without compromising the therapeutic effect of combined treatment .
Similar findings were reported in the 4-yr analysis for the total patient population .
Between September 1975 and May 1978 ,  a total of 466 consecutive patients were entered into a prospective randomized study .
Based on the 3-yr analysis of our first CMF study showing an apparent lack of therapeutic advantage following adjuvant chemotherapy in postmenopausal women ,  randomization for this group of patients was discontinued at the end of November 1976 .
All patients were subjected to either Halsted or modified radical mastectomy ,  but a small fraction (16%) was subjected to extended radical mastectomy .
Adjuvant chemotherapy was started within 2-4 wk from mastectomy .
Primary treatment failure was accurately assessed by clinical ,  radiologic ,  and whenever feasible ,  histologic examination of the site(s) of first relapse .
Details on baseline studies and follow-up program were as previously reported , 1 ,  2 and they can be summarized as follows .
In the presence of controversial radiologic findings ,  examinations were performed more often than originally planned .
The short-term interval between two examinations was planned to carefully assess the exact time and extent of new disease manifestations .
In the present series ,  baseline and routine bone scans were systematically performed in about half of patients .
Statistical Evaluation .
Probabilities represent comparison of the entire plots ,  computed by use of the productlimit method ,  and were calculated using the log-rank test and values of significance .
In postmenopausal women with more than 3 nodes ,  the difference between CMF 12 (34.4%) and CMF 6 (54.9% ,  p = 0.18) is only apparent since the confidence-limits throughout the curve totally blurred the percent difference (standard error ,  or SE ,  at 5 yr ,  8.4 and 11.3 ,  respectively) .
The same held true when findings were related to menopausal status .
The findings for postmenopausal women were 74.2% and 76.6% ,  respectively (p = 0.72) .
The incidence of contralateral breast involvement alone ,  which in our series has always been considered as primary treatment failure ,  was 2.5% versus 2.3% .
Table 3 details the findings observed at 5 yr from mastectomy .
The importance of the level of doses administered has been detailed in one of our previous reports. 4 A similar type of analysis was performed on patients entered into this study .
Table 4 shows that also in this series there was evidence of a dose-response effect ,  regardless of menopausal and nodal status (CMF 12 ,  level I 68.9% versus level 11147.2% ,  p < 0.05 ,  CMF 6 ,  level I 66.6% versus level III 51.5% ,  p = 0.10) .
Early and Late Toxicity .
Acute toxic reactions have been previously reported .
DISCUSSION .
A long-term analysis would probably clarify this aspect .
Other considerations of practical importance can also be derived from our current findings .
Thus ,  in the present study ,  only a small fraction of patients was started on drug doses that once more proved to be therapeutically ineffective .
A trend favoring postmenopausal versus premenopausal women given adjuvant combination chemotherapy was also observed by the NSABP group .
Effective adjuvant combination chemotherapy seems to be unaffected by ER status ,  at least when RFS is considered .
In spite of initial controversial findings ,  recent retrospective studies carried out in advanced breast cancer have consistently shown lack of significant correlation between ER status and response rate to cytotoxic chemotherapy .
The fact that premenopausal women with ER + showed a significantlylonger survival than their matches with ER - tumors remains to be further evaluated .
At present ,  we have no clear explanation for this difference .
Eventually ,  and regardless of prolonged chemotherapy ,  the resistant neoplastic cells overgrow ,  become clinically evident ,  and kill the host .
At present ,  tumor cell burden in the axilla appears to consistently represent an important prognostic factor ,  even in the presence of full dose chemotherapy ,  while new prospective trials should explore the potential efficacy of multiple non-cross-resistant drug combinations delivered for a relatively short time .
