Nevertheless ,  there are reasons to reconsider radiotherapy ,  including the limited value of adjuvant chemotherapy for bulky disease ,  a synergistic effect of chemotherapy plus radiation on residual locoregional tumor ,  and the possibility that eliminating bulky disease with radiation may improve the effect of chemotherapy ,  because chemotherapy may be more effective when the overall disease burden is low .
From 1979 through 1986 ,  318 premenopausal women with newly diagnosed stage I or II breast cancer were enrolled in the study after undergoing modified radical mastectomy if ,  after axillary-node dissection ,  one or more level I or II lymph nodes were found to be positive on pathological examination .
The surgery was performed by specialists who referred all the patients to the British Columbia Cancer Agency ,  the provincial cancer institute ,  for registration ,  randomization ,  and the planning of the chemotherapy and radiation treatments .
The other eight studies were notsimilar to ours or the Danish trial ,  either because the number of randomized premenopausal patients was small or because the radiotherapy techniques or the chemotherapy schedules were heterogeneous .
Four randomized trials comparing breast irradiation with no irradiation in patients who underwent conservative surgery showed significant reductions in the rate of relapse in the breast but no effect on systemic recurrences or overall survival .
