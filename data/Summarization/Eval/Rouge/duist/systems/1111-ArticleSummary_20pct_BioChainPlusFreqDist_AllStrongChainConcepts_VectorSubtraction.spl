However ,  the 20% mortality after surgery has remained virtually unchanged during the past three decades .
Certain clinical and pathologic risk factors for Stage 1 cervical cancer recurrence have been identified .
Several authors proposed that patients with certain primary tumorrelated factors such as LTD ,  DSI ,  and CLS might also benefit from postoperative radiotherapy .
The study’s target sample size was set at 169 eligible patients based on a desire to detect a 55% decrease in recurrence rate (exponential model with l 5 0.01 recurrences/month) with the use of radiation therapy .
In 1993 ,  the sample size goal was increased because of the lower than expected recurrence rate ,  a better estimate of the change in the recurrence rate over time ,  and a small ,  but significant ,  frequency of noncompliance in the radiation therapy (RT) regimen .
The ureter had to be unroofed from its entry into the broad ligament to its intramural portion in the bladder and dissected laterally from its attachments to the cardinal ligament .
Radiation Therapy .
Radiation therapy was started within 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively .
Treatment breaks for clinical problems (vomiting or diarrhea) were allowed to total no more than 1 week .
Review of operative reports was conducted to evaluate the completeness of surgical procedures .
The primary outcome variable was recurrence-free interval (RFI) .
Life tables were computed using the method of Kaplan and Meier .
The difference between treatment regimens ,  while adjusting for prognostic factors ,  was accomplished using the Cox Model .
When the characteristic was continuous (e.g. ,  age) the Kruskal–Wallis test was used .
There was a disproportionately larger number of patients with positive CLS among the NFT regimen (24% versus 35%) and more patients with .4 cm diameter tumors in the RT regimen (62% versus 54%) .
The crude estimate in the reduction in risk in patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy was 47% (i.e. ,  relative risk 5 0.53) with the recurrence-free rate of 88% in the radiotherapy group and 79% in the no-further-therapy group at 2 years (Fig. 1) .
Eighty-six percent of patients have either died or have been followed at least 3 years .
Of those who are alive ,  six patients are lost-to-follow-up within the first year in the RT group while one is lost in the NFT group .
Within 2 years on study ,  there are eight and three patients in the RT group and NFT group ,  respectively .
In an attempt to evaluate the impact of this imbalance ,  the log–rank test was recalculated assuming the first five patients lost (the excess number) in the RT group recurred at the time of their last clinical evaluation .
DISCUSSION .
The invasion of lymphvascular spaces by tumor has been found to be an unfavorable prognostic factor by many investigators but its significance was denied by others .
Of the three risk factors ,  depth of invasion seems the most objective and accurate method—a direct measurement on the histological slide .
The formula combining the three risk factors that we used to determine patient eligibility may appear complicated .
Nevertheless ,  the use of this formula by the participating institutions has been successful in achieving a high acceptance rate with only 22 patients (7%) found ineligible for the study .
Partly due to this lower risk ,  the sample size was increased in August 1993 in order that the statistical power of the trial would be maintained .
A significant number of women with Stage IB cervical cancer should benefit from adjuvant pelvic irradiation because 25% of the lymph-node negative patients have high risk factors according to the 1990 GOG data .
Moreover ,  Thomas and Dembo have demonstrated that ,  in absolute terms ,  an equal number of deaths occur among the estimated 85% of Stage IB cervical cancer patients with negative nodes as among the 15% with positive nodes .
One of these women died from complications of enteric fistula and another died from cancer after successful management of intestinal injury .
This conclusion is based on a significant reduction of cancer recurrences in patients in our study and acceptably low morbidity with a single treatment-related fatality .
