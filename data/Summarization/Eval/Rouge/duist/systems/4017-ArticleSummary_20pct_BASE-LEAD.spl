Introduction .
Standard therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer is fluorouracil ,  commonly modulated by calcium folinate ,  which typically yields a median survival time of 10-14 months .
Fluorouracil can be used as first-line or second-line therapy and a different regimen of fluorouracil can be administered as second-line treatment if first-line treatment fails .
Survival time in these patients is typically short .
Quality of life in patients receiving this treatment is generally poor .
Irinotecan inactivates topoisomerase I and thereby inhibits cell division .
The drug has no cross-resistance with fluorouracil and functions via a novel molecular mechanism .
Phase III studies of patients whose disease had not responded to first-line fluorouracil ,  or patients whose disease had progressed after first-line fluorouracil treatment ,  showed increased survival times in patients given irinotecan compared with those receiving best supportive care or high-dose fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone by continuous infusion .
Data suggest that the development of well-tolerated regimens that combine irinotecan and high-dose fluorouracil and calcium folinate may be beneficial in the first-line treatment of colorectal cancer .
Phase I dose-escalation studies were done to test combined irinotecan with fluorouracil and calcium folinate weekly or every 2 weeks .
These regimens were selected for first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer ,  based on promising antitumour efficacy and an acceptable safety profile .
The choice of regimen was left to investigators ,  according to local clinical practice ,  since the two regimens are widely used in Europe .
The irinotecan combination and fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone were expected to differ by similar magnitudes in each regimen .
Analysis of pooled data for efficacy showed that irinotecan gave a significant survival advantage .
We did a phase III multicentre randomised trial that was designed to assess whether the addition of irinotecan to fluorouracil and calcium folinate would benefit patients previously untreated with chemotherapy (other than adjuvant) for metastatic colorectal cancer .
Methods .
Patients .
From May ,  1997 ,  to February ,  1998 ,  we enrolled patients who met the following eligibility criteria ,  histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum ,  age 18-75 years ,  WHO performance status of 2 or less and life expectancy of more than 3 months ,  haemoglobin 100 g/L or more ,  absolute neutrophil count 2.0 10/L ,  platelets 150 10/L or more ,  creatinine 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal ,  total bilirubin 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal ,  aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 3.0 or less times the upper limit of normal (if liver metastases present ,  1.5 or less times for bilirubin and 5.0 or less times for aspartate and alanine aminotransferases) ,  and no previous (other than adjuvant) chemotherapy ,  finished more than 6 months before randomisation .
We obtained written informed consent from each patient before enrolment .
Approval was obtained from the ethics committee of each participating centre .
Patients with the following criteria were not eligible ,  central-nervous-system metastasis ,  unresolved bowel obstruction or diarrhoea ,  and known contraindications to fluorouracil (angina pectoris ,  myocardial infarction in the past 6 months) .
Study design .
We did the trial in 13 European countries ,  Israel ,  and South Africa .
We randomly assigned patients irinotecan combined with fluorouracil and calcium folinate (irinotecan group) or fluorouracil and calcium folinate only (no-irinotecan group ,  figure 1) .
Randomisation was done centrally in the study sponsor's office by a computer-generated random scheme ,  and was stratified by centre .
Before the start of the study ,  each investigator chose one of two proposed regimens for fluorouracil and calcium folinate ,  according to local clinical practice or preference (De Gramont [every 2 weeks] or Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internische Onkologie ,  cooperative German group for oncology [once weekly]) .
These regimens were used for combined treatment and fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone .
For the irinotecan group ,  the regimens were ,  once weekly ,  irinotecan 80 mg/m with fluorouracil 2300 mg/m by 24 h infusion ,  plus calcium folinate 500 mg/m (n=54) ,  or ,  every 2 weeks ,  irinotecan 180 mg/m on day 1 with fluorouracil 400 mg/m bolus and 600 mg/m by 22 h infusion ,  plus calcium folinate 200 mg/m on days 1 and 2 (n=145) .
For the noirinotecan group ,  the regimens were ,  once-weekly ,  fluorouracil 2600 mg/m by 24 h infusion plus calcium folinate 500 mg/m2 (n=43) ,  or every 2 weeks ,  fluorouracil and calcium folinate at the same doses and administration as in the irinotecan-group 2weekly regimen (n=143) .
Treatment was given until disease progressed ,  the patient developed unacceptable toxic effects ,  or consent was withdrawn .
Irinotecan was administered according to the guidelines used for irinotecan monotherapy ,  including recommendations for the use of concurrent antiemetics ,  atropine ,  and loperamide .
