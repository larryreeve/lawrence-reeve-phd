Introduction .
These regimens were selected for first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer ,  based on promising antitumour efficacy and an acceptable safety profile .
Patients .
Approval was obtained from the ethics committee of each participating centre .
Patients with the following criteria were not eligible ,  central-nervous-system metastasis ,  unresolved bowel obstruction or diarrhoea ,  and known contraindications to fluorouracil (angina pectoris ,  myocardial infarction in the past 6 months) .
At the end of the treatment period ,  patients were followed up for progression every 3 months .
We used the validated QLQC30 questionnaire of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer .
For continuous variables ,  we used Student's t tests .
We based the selection of models of prognostic factors on a forward stepwise procedure ,  with the treatment being forced in the model .
To enter and remove terms in the model we used p=0.08 and p=0.10 ,  respectively .
The time to definitive deterioration from baseline by 5% ,  10% ,  20% ,  and 30% was analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method .
Results .
Efficacy .
The median duration of response was 9.3 (2.8-13.1) months in the irinotecan group and 8.8 (3.7-11.8) months in the no-irinotecan group (p=0.08) .
The probability of survival in the irinotecan group was 81.0% at 9 months and 66.7% at 12 months ,  and in the no[0+.11.8+] months ,  p<0.001 ,  figure 2) .
Median followirinotecan group was 69.8% and 54.8% ,  respectively .
The vs 14.1 [0.5-27.6+] months ,  p=0.031 ,  figure 3) .
The probability of survival in the irinotecan group was 82.1% at 9 months and 69.1% at 12 months ,  and in the noirinotecan group was 71.6% and 59.1% ,  respectively .
The median time to treatment failure was 5.3 (0.4-15.7+) months in the irinotecan group and 3.8 (0.4-11.5+) months in the no-irinotecan group (p=0.0014) .
Safety .
Grade 3 and 4 toxic effects occurring at a frequency of 3% or more are shown in tables 5 and 6 .
This adverse effect occurred more frequently with the weekly than with the corresponding 2-weekly regimen in the two treatment groups .
In the irinotecan group ,  about 25% of patients developed cholinergic syndromes that were rarely severe .
Quality of life .
QL did not differ significantly between groups .
The same trend was seen with the second imputation method .
Discussion .
The higher frequency of adverse events in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan did not affect the median duration of treatment .
The rate of grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea was similar to that previously seen with irinotecan administered as a single agent .
Overall ,  toxic effects seen with the irinotecan combination treatment were reversible ,  non-cumulative ,  and manageable .
Moreover ,  there was a trend towards shorter survival in the oxaliplatin group in one study .
