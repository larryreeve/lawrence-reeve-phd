TRIALS of postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer conducted during the 1960s and 1970s showed significant reductions in rates of locoregional recurrence but no improvement in overall survival .
Nevertheless ,  there are reasons to reconsider radiotherapy ,  including the limited value of adjuvant chemotherapy for bulky disease ,  a synergistic effect of chemotherapy plus radiation on residual locoregional tumor ,  and the possibility that eliminating bulky disease with radiation may improve the effect of chemotherapy ,  because chemotherapy may be more effective when the overall disease burden is low .
After written informed consent was obtained ,  the patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy plus locoregional radiotherapy in five fields (the chemotherapyÿ¿¿¿¿¿radiotherapy group ,  with 164 patients) and those receiving chemotherapy alone (the chemotherapy group ,  with 154 patients) .
The chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (600 mg per square meter of body-surface area) ,  methotrexate (40 mg per square meter) ,  and fluorouracil (600 mg per square meter) (the CMF regimen) ,  given intravenously every 21 days as described by Bonadonna et al. ,  initially for 12 months (80 patients) ,  and in the case of patients randomized after 1981 ,  for 6 months .
Eleven patients (3.5 percent) were lost to follow-up ÿ¿¿¿¿¿ three (1.9 percent) from the chemotherapy group and eight (4.9 percent) from the chemotherapyÿ¿¿¿¿¿radiotherapy group .
Of the 164 patients randomly assigned to chemotherapy and radiotherapy ,  12 did not receive radiotherapy and were treated with chemotherapy alone (7 declined radiotherapy ,  3 had metastases before radiotherapy ,  and 2 had postsurgical complications) .
During the 15 years of follow-up ,  breast cancer had recurred in 176 patients and 144 patients died .
In the group treated with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy ,  79 of 164 patients had recurrences ÿ¿¿¿¿¿ locoregional ,  systemic ,  or both ÿ¿¿¿¿¿ as compared with 97 of 154 patients in the group given chemotherapy alone .
94 of 154 patients in the group treated only with chemotherapy) ,  and a 17-percentage-point improvement in systemic disease-free survival (Fig. Among the 94 patients who had systemic relapses after chemotherapy alone ,  19 were alive at the time of the 15-year analysis ,  as compared with 9 of the 75 patients with such relapses in the chemotherapyÿ¿¿¿¿¿radiotherapy group .
Radiation also improved outcome in the 68 patients randomly assigned to ovarian ablation ,  in regard to disease-free survival (relative risk ,  0.72) ,  survival free of systemic disease (relative risk ,  0.76) ,  and overall survival (relative risk ,  0.88) .
It is possible that we will see additional benefit in overall survival ,  because at this writing 19 patients in the chemotherapy group remain alive with systemic recurrence ,  as compared with only 9 in the combined-treatment group;  Because all our patients were uniformly treated with chest-wall and nodal radiation ,  our results may not apply to patients treated with breast irradiation alone after conservative surgery .
Locoregional radiation is not routinely used at present in patients with node-positive breast cancer ,  although it is coming into use to treat patients with 10 or more positive nodes and occasionally those with 4 or more positive nodes .
