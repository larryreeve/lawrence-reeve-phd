In 1990 ,  the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) began a randomized clinical trial to compare the effects on survival of treatment with extended-field radiation and treatment with pelvic radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in patients with cervical cancer .
We enrolled women of all ages who had stages IIB through IVA squamous-cell carcinoma ,  adenocarcinoma ,  or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix according to the staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (Table 1) or stage IB or IIA of one of these cancers with a tumor diameter of at least 5 cm or biopsy-proved metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes .
Custom shielding was designed to treat the pelvic lymph nodes ,  with a margin of at least 1 to 1.5 cm. For patients who were assigned to receive radiotherapy alone ,  the pelvic and paraaortic areas were treated as a continuous area ,  with a superiorfield border at the space between L1 and L2 .
Within 16 hours after the first radiation fraction was administered ,  patients in the combination-therapy group received the first cycle of chemotherapy ,  which consisted of an intravenous infusion of 75 mg of cisplatin per square meter of body-surface area over a 4-hour period followed by an intravenous infusion of 4000 mg of fluorouracil per square meter over a 96-hour period .
On the basis of the results of two earlier RTOG trials ,  we predicted that the five-year survival rate for the control group (radiotherapy alone) would be 65 percent for patients with stage IB or II disease and 40 percent for patients with stage III or IVA disease .
Fifteen patients (4 percent) — six in the combined-therapy group and nine in the radiotherapy group — were subsequently disqualified because of failure to undergo the required evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (eight patients) ,  the presence of extrapelvic cancer (two) ,  the presence of a rare histologic subtype (one) ,  the presence of a stage IB1 tumor with no involvement of pelvic nodes (one) ,  the absence of pretreatment data (two) ,  and receipt of chemotherapy before radiotherapy (one) .
Although the group reported significant improvements in overall and disease-free survival with the addition of hydroxyurea therapy ,  the study has been criticized for the use of a low dose of radiation and the poor survival rates in both groups and because more than half of the 190 patients who were enrolled could not be evaluated .
Despite these criticisms ,  the resultsof that study and those of trials assessing concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy for other tumors stimulated studies of the effects of radiotherapy and various combinations of fluorouracil ,  cisplatin ,  mitomycin ,  carboplatin ,  and paclitaxel as treatments for locally advanced cervical cancer.The results of these trials have been encouraging ,  but mostclinicians have not found them sufficiently  convincing to justify the inclusion of chemotherapy in the routine treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer .
