Purpose: As previously shown antibody treatment increased survival of patients with resected colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C .
Since the 5-year analysis was criticized because of the wide range 2.7 to 7.5 years of follow-up time we performed a 7-year analysis with only four of 189 patients monitored for less than 5 years .
Patients and Methods: A total of 189 patients with resected Dukes' C colorectal cancer were randomly allocated to infusions of a total of 900 mg 17-1A antibody 500 mg postoperatively followed by 4 monthly doses of 100 mg n 99 or to observation only n 90. Primary end points were overall survival and disease-free interval .
After 7 years of follow-up evaluation treatment had reduced overall mortality by 32 Cox's proportional hazard P .01 log-rank P .01 and decreased the recurrence rate by 23 Cox's proportional hazard P .04 log-rank P .07. This differential effect of 17-1A antibody on disseminated isolated tumor cells versus occult local satellites may explain the increased significance seen in the overall survival .
Conclusion: The now-matured study shows that 17-1A antibody administered after surgery prevents the development of distant metastasis in approximately one third of patients .
Now after a median observation time of 7 years with only four of 185 patients monitored for less than 5 years the study has matured and continues to demonstrate a significant benefit with regard to survival .
The 17-1A antibody a munne monoclonal mmunoglobulin IgG2a antibody orginally described by Herlyn has a distinct antitumor effect on human xenografted tumors in a nude mouse model Clnical-grade antibody was purchased from the Wistar Institute Philadelphia PA with support by the German Cancer Aid Bonn Germany .
Some patients have now been monitored for 10 years and only five patients were observed for a period of less than 5 years with a range of 3.5 to 4.5 years .
The KaplanMeier survival curves Fig 1A showed a significant benefit for patients who received antibody over those who did not receive treatment P .01 with Cox's proportional hazard model corrected for influence of prognostic variables and P .01 with log-rank test for the univariate analysis .
Also the intention-to-treat analysis Fig B on all 185 patients showed a significant overall benefit for the treated group P .01 with Cox's multivariate analysis and P .02 with log-rank test for the univanate analysis .
Among all deaths recorded six patients died without recurrence or secondary colorectal cancer and one observed patient of the control group died of secondary colon carcinoma which was not counted as a recurrence .
When cancer-related mortality was assessed ie death without recurrence was not counted as event the benefit of treatment remained significant at P .01 by Cox's multivariate analysis and P .01 by log-rank test for the univariate analysis .
The median survival time before death after recurrence was 1.4 years for patients randomized to treatment with 17-1A and 1.2 years for patients in the observed group .
According to the disease-free interval analysis tumor recurred in 96 of 166 eligible patients after 7 years of follow-up evaluation thus three more recurrences were recorded m the treatment group and one more in the observation arm .
However when death without recurrence was considered an event recurrence-free survival again a significant treatment advantage with 17-1A over control was obtained P .03 with Cox multivariate and P .05 with log-rank test for the umvariate analysis .
When the analyses of recurrence-free interval and recurrence-free survival were performed including all randomized patients ie according to intention-to-treat 17-1A treatment again led to significant advantage over the untreated group Cox multivanate P .02 log-rank P .01 respectively .
In summary 46 of patients 41 of 90 in the treatment group are at nsk at 7 years and only 29 of patients 22 of 76 m the observed group are alive without recurrence .
When the two groups were compared with regard to the site of first recurrence the 7-year data similar to the 5-year analysis show that significantly fewer distant recurrences occur in patients treated with the antibody than in the control arm Fig 3. When tested for antibody response against murine antibody HAMA 80 of treated patients developed a distinct HAMA response after the second or third nfusion .
As the 7-year median follow-up data confirm the previously reported 5-year findings the conclusion seems warranted that antibody treatment improves the chances of curatively operated patients .
Since these forms of therapy were administered only to the control group a bias may have been introduced that influenced the outcome against the antibody treatment which explains the apparent difference seen m the local recurrence rate Table 2. While after 5 years of follow-up evaluation a significant increase in disease-free and overall survival of patients was evident after 2 further years the overall survival did not show significance .
Patients in the control group continued to die of progressive disease that probably had arisen from occult distant metastatic cells that were elimnated by the antibody in the treatment group .
In that trial only colon cancer patients were treated who were known to have fewer local relapses than rectum cancer patients and were included in our trial .
Why only one third of the patients at risk have responded to the antibody treatment may be explained by variations in accessibility vulnerability and/or antigen expression in individual disseminated tumor cells .
In other studies that also targeted a monoclonal antibody to an organ-specific rather than a tumor-specific antigen the tumor-specific biologic action induced by the applied antibody had been ascribed to the faster elimination of the bound antibody from normal than from malignant cells .
One of these trials performed in Europe and Israel includes a confirmatory arm with antibody as single treatment with the other two arms applying chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus antibody respectively .
