The same postradiation regimen of 5-FU and MeCCNU as that used in GI 7175 was chosen for one arm ,  with the exception that the duration of treatment with postradiation 5-FU and MeCCNU was reduced from 18 months to 12 months in an attempt to reduce the leukemogenic potential of the MeCCNU .
Patients must have recovered from the acute effects of surgery ,  been capable of starting treatment within 60 days after resection ,  had no evidence of active infection ,  had adequate performance and nutritional status to tolerate protocol treatment ,  and had no preexisting or concurrent malignant tumors except basal cell or superficial squamous cell carcinomas of the skin .
Dose reductions of 5-FU by 25% were required for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU treatment arm who experienced a leukocyte count nadir of below 2,000/UL during the first 3 weeks .
Selected patient characteristics show that 58% had disease extension involving the perirectal fat with at least one positive lymph node ,  60% of patients are male ,  and 59% underwent an abdominal-perineal resection (Table 1) .
When included in the Cox model ,  Dukes stage ,  resection type ,  distance to the nearest margin (<= 3 cm v other) ,  and the interaction between resection type and distance to the nearest margin were found to be significant without adjustment for multiple comparisons in predicting disease-free survival(P < .05) .
Eighty-one of the deaths were attributed to progressive disease ,  and one death was reported without documented cause ,  the causes of death for the remaining nine patients were attributed to treatment (two patients ,  discussed above) ,  myocardial infarctions (five , three of whom had a suspected recurrence) ,  stroke (one) ,  and metastatic disease resulting from a new primary tumor arising in the bile duct (one) .
As in the disease-free analysis ,  secondary analyses of survival considering either all patients randomized or only patients who received treatment after the completion of radiation therapy ,  resulted in no meaningful change in direction or magnitude of the RR attributed to treatment with the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen (RR = 1.10 ,  95% CI ,  .72 to 1.67 ,  and RR = 1.04 ,  95% CI ,  .65 to 1.67 ,  respectively) .
The results of this study indicate that treatment after surgical resection of Dukes B2 and C rectal cancer with escalating 5-FU postradiation therapy provides similar survival and recurrence outcomes as a postradiation chemotherapeutic regimen including the leukemogen MeCCNU .
The results of the present study confirm the expected survival and disease-free survival probabilities observed in the combination therapy arm of the previous GITSG study ,  while the recent report by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) further demonstrates the advantage of combination radiation therapy and chemotherapy compared with radiation therapy alone in reducing recurrence rates and improving survival .
Although data from the initial rectal cancer adjuvant trial conducted by the National Surgical Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP RO1) suggested improved survival and disease-free survival in patients treated with chemotherapy alone compared with surgery alone ,  that study did not include a combined modality treatment arm .
