Although  40-50% patients may be cured with surgery ,  many will  develop metastatic disease .
For these patients ,  treatment  with fluorouracil ,  usually modulated by folinic acid ,  is  the only option and the median survival is  10-12 months .
Common side-effects included delayed diarrhoea ,  neutropenia , early cholinergic syndrome ,  nausea and  vomiting ,  alopecia , and asthenia .
To be eligible for randomisation ,  patients had to meet the following criteria ,  histologically proven metastatic colorectal cancer ,  progressive metastatic disease documented on the basis of either a 25% increase in the size of target lesions or an increase in carcinoembryonic antigen by 1.25 times an initial reference value and a baseline value of more than 10 ug/L ,   which allowed inclusion of patients with non-measurable  disease (peritoneal carcinomatosis and pelvic recurrences) ,   progression documented by two measurements not separated by  more than 6 months and tumour progression while on  fluorouracil or within 6 months of the last fluorouracil infusion ,  having had one adjuvant and/or no more than two palliative  fluorouracil-based regimens ,  age 18-75 years ,  WHO performance status 0.2 ,  neutrophils 2 10/L or more ,  platelets  100x10/L or more ,  total bilirubin 1.25 the institutional upper normal limit (IUNL) ,  or less ,  liver transaminases 3xIUNL (in  case of liver metastases ,  bilirubin <=1.5 IUNL and  transaminases <=5 IUNL) ,  or more ,  serum creatinine  135 umol/L or less ,  wash-out of 4 weeks for radiotherapy or  chemotherapy ,  and written informed consent .
Guidelines were provided for the management of side-effects (panel) .
Localised  radiation therapy to alleviate symptoms such as pain was  allowed provided that the total dose delivered was in the  palliative range according to institutional standards .
Analysis of best supportive care .
Supportive care and concomitant medications were reported at each visit (every 3 weeks in both groups) .
With these classifications ,  analgesics were divided into opioids  or non-opioids and analysed in 3-week blocks .
Patients visited the investigator for assessment and treatment every 3 weeks .
After discontinuation of treatment in the irinotecan group ,  patients were regularly assessed as in the supportive care group  (tumour status ,  symptoms ,  or side-effects ,  every 3 weeks) until  death or for at least a year .
Quality of life was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire (including five function scales ,  one global health-status scale ,  and nine symptom scales) ,  which was filled in at  baseline ,  at 3 weeks ,  6 weeks ,  and then every 6 weeks .
With p=0.05 and power of 0.80 ,  264 patients were  required (176 in the irinotecan group and 88 in the supportive-care group) to show a significant difference in 1-year survival from 20% (supportive care) to 35% (irinotecan) .
Model selection for identifying the variables having an effect on survival was based on a forward stepwise procedure. p values to enter and to remove were 0.05 and 0.06 ,  respectively .
The patients' characteristics are shown in table 1 .
Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival are presented in figure 2 .
There were 123 (65%) events in the irinotecan  group ,  median duration of which was 9.2 (range 0-18.9)  months .
With a performance status of less than two there were 98 (60%) events in the irinotecan group ,  median duration  of which was 10.5 (range 0.18-9) months .
The survival  probability for this group at 6 months was 76.3% ,  at  9 months 57.2% ,  and at 12 months 40.1% .
The survival probability for  this group at 6 months was 46.2% ,  at 9 months 26.9% ,  and at 12 months 15.4% .
In the supportive-care group there were 18 (86%) events ,  the median duration of  which was 3.5 (range 1.1-11.0) months .
When the  treatment group was included in the model , the survival benefit for the irinotecan group remained significant (p=0.001) .
Secondary endpoints .
Pain-free survival in patients without pain at baseline (figure 4) was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the supportive-care group (p=0.003) ,  despite a higher proportion of patients on opioids in the supportive-care group .
The study also showed an advantage for irinotecan for quality of life .
The results were consistent with other clinical variables (performance status deterioration ,  weight loss , and pain control) .
The value of irinotecan was confirmed in  terms of survival ,  quality of life ,  and other clinical  variables .
