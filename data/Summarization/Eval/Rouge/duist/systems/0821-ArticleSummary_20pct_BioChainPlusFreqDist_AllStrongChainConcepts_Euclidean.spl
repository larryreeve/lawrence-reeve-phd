The sequential exposure of L1210 cells to MTX and then to 5-FU was shown to increase the intracellular concentration of 5-FU ribonucleotides ,  a potential mechanism of synergy .
We therefore conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial in which sequential MTX followed by 5-FU was compared to the same drugs given in the opposite order .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Patients eligible for this study had measurable or evaluable advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck , adenocarcinoma of the colon ,  rectum or stomach ,  or SCC of other primary site (Table I) .
The inclusion of some patients with previously untreated stage II head and neck cancer reflected the opinion of the combined head and neck clinic that they were unsuitable for cure by surgery or radiotherapy .
Patients received oral or IV bicarbonate to ensure a urine pH of at least 7.0 at the time of MTX administration and for 24 hours thereafter ,  then oral folinic acid rescue (FAR) for eight doses of 15 mg each 6 hours commencing 24 hours after the MTX .
Subsequent treatment was dependent on the primary site and on prior treatment ,  but was defined by the protocol to be radiotherapy after completion of protocol chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer .
These univariate analyses were supplemented by stepwise Cox model multivariate survival comparison (program BMDP2L) ,  selecting default conditions for the inclusion and exclusion of terms ,  and the MPLR stepping option .
Variables included in the Cox models for all patients with head and neck cancer were treatment group ,  prior radiotherapy ,  performance status ,  sex ,  and prior surgery .
For previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  stage expressed as either stage group or as T ,  N ,  and M stage ,  separately and with two and three-way interactions were also included .
Default conditions for the inclusion and exclusion of terms were used ,  and the MLR stepping option selected .
Both treatment sequences were effective in head and neck cancer ,  producing an overall major response rate (complete and partial) of 46% of all entered patients ,  including 52% (95% confidence limits ,  39%-65%) of evaluable patients .
Other factors including stage ,  sex ,  prior radiotherapy ,  and prior surgery were not significant .
In the small number of patients with colorectal cancer we observed a response rate of 33% (40% of evaluable patients) ,  a figure somewhat higher than that usually seen after 5-FU as a single agent ,  but the 95% confidence limits for this rate (19%-64%) emphasize that this could be a chance observation .
Antagonism could have provided a therapeutic advantage if it were more marked in normal tissues than in tumor ,  as higher doses could then have been used in the FM arm .
This prediction is based on results obtained in tissue culture using low purine concentrations ,  and its relevance to effects in vivo remains uncertain .
They were unable to show a benefit for sequential administration ,  indeed ,  the trend in their study favored the simultaneous therapy group .
