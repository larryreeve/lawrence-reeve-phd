Quality of life in patients receiving this treatment is generally poor .
Phase III studies of patients whose disease had not responded to first-line fluorouracil ,  or patients whose disease had progressed after first-line fluorouracil treatment ,  showed increased survival times in patients given irinotecan compared with those receiving best supportive care or high-dose fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone by continuous infusion .
From May ,  1997 ,  to February ,  1998 ,  we enrolled patients who met the following eligibility criteria ,  histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum ,  age 18-75 years ,  WHO performance status of 2 or less and life expectancy of more than 3 months ,  haemoglobin 100 g/L or more ,  absolute neutrophil count 2.0 10/L ,  platelets 150 10/L or more ,  creatinine 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal ,  total bilirubin 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal ,  aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 3.0 or less times the upper limit of normal (if liver metastases present ,  1.5 or less times for bilirubin and 5.0 or less times for aspartate and alanine aminotransferases) ,  and no previous (other than adjuvant) chemotherapy ,  finished more than 6 months before randomisation .
Patients with the following criteria were not eligible ,  central-nervous-system metastasis ,  unresolved bowel obstruction or diarrhoea ,  and known contraindications to fluorouracil (angina pectoris ,  myocardial infarction in the past 6 months) .
Before the start of the study ,  each investigator chose one of two proposed regimens for fluorouracil and calcium folinate ,  according to local clinical practice or preference (De Gramont [every 2 weeks] or Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internische Onkologie ,  cooperative German group for oncology [once weekly]) .
For the noirinotecan group ,  the regimens were ,  once-weekly ,  fluorouracil 2600 mg/m by 24 h infusion plus calcium folinate 500 mg/m2 (n=43) ,  or every 2 weeks ,  fluorouracil and calcium folinate at the same doses and administration as in the irinotecan-group 2weekly regimen (n=143) .
Irinotecan was administered according to the guidelines used for irinotecan monotherapy ,  including recommendations for the use of concurrent antiemetics ,  atropine ,  and loperamide .
We lowered doses for irinotecan and fluorouracil by 20% if severe toxic effects occurred .
The secondary endpoints for efficacy were time to progression ,  duration of response ,  time to treatment failure ,  and overall survival .
The duration of response and stabilisation was the time from first infusion to progression in responding and stable patients .
The questionnaire includes five scales for functioning ,  one scale for global health status ,  and nine symptom scales .
Based on the assumption that time to progression would be 6 months in the no-irinotecan group and 9 months in the irinotecan group ,  we calculated that 286 patients were needed to show a significant difference for this variable .
We tested for interaction between treatment and regimen by log-rank tests and ,  additionally ,  we did a log-rank test stratified by regimen .
The first group included countries that had recruited more than 30 patients (UK ,  Spain ,  France ,  Czech Republic ,  Germany ,  and Austria) ,  the second countries that had recruited 10.30 patients (Belgium ,  Israel ,  South Africa ,  Switzerland ,  and Italy) ,  and the third countries that had recruited fewer than ten patients (Greece ,  Portugal ,  and the Netherlands) .
We tested the nine following variables ,  sex ,  WHO performance status (<2 and <=2) ,  weight loss (<=5% and >5%) ,  number of organs involved (<3 and <=3) ,  primary tumour site (colon or rectum) ,  organ involvement (liver only or other sites) ,  time from first diagnosis to first metastasis (0.3 ,  >3-12 ,  >12 months) ,  previous surgery ,  and previous adjuvant therapy .
For time to progression ,  Cox's proportional hazards modelling was used ,  with the following variables ,  sex ,  age (<58 and <=58 years) ,  WHO performance status (<2 and >= 2) ,  weight loss (<=5% and >5%) ,  number of organs involved (<3 and >=3) ,  primary tumour site (colon or rectum) ,  liver involvement ,  lymph-node involvement ,  time from first diagnosis to first metastasis (0-3 ,  >3.12 ,  >12 months) ,  previous surgery ,  previous adjuvant therapy ,  time from first diagnosis and first infusion (<9 and <=9 months) .
Two patients received no study treatment because consent was withdrawn .
Tumour characteristics and history in the two groups were comparable ,  except for previous surgery ,  since 89% of patients had had surgery in the irinotecan group and 95% in the no-irinotecan group .
In the irinotecan group ,  the relative dose intensity was 0.82 for irinotecan and 0.81 for fluorouracil in the weekly regimen ,  and 0.93 and 0.92 ,  respectively ,  in the 2-weekly regimen .
The median time to onset of response was 8.9 (range 4.7-25.4) weeks in the irinotecan group medians.21 The probability of survival in the irinotecan group was 84.9% at 9 months and 75.5% at 12 months ,  and in the no-irinotecan group was 77.3% and 62.7% ,  respectively .
In the intention-to-treat analysis of the 2weekly regimen ,  the response rate was ,  for the irinotecan and 11.4 (5.3-29.6) weeks in the no-irinotecan group .
The effect of treatment was significant (p<0.001) ,  the Survival in the irinotecan group was significantly longer hazard ratio for response was 2.6 times higher in the than in the no-irinotecan group (median 17.4 [0.4-28.4+] irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group ,  given the same degree of weight loss at baseline and the same time between first diagnosis and first metastasis .
This finding supported the hypothesis that the difference in the two regimens would be similar in the two treatment groups and allowed the pooling of data .
There was insufficient power to compare the efficacy risk of progression for a patient in the no-irinotecan group was increased by about 69% compared with that for a patient in the irinotecan group when all other variables were equal .
In the irinotecan group ,  diarrhoea and neutropenia were the most common toxic effects in each regimen ,  and were significantly more frequent and severe than in the noirinotecan group .
In the irinotecan group ,  admission was required for fever in the absence of infection with concomitant grade 3 or 4 neutropenia for five (9.3%) patients on the weekly regimen and one (0.7%) on the 2-weekly regimen ,  for the no-irinotecan group ,  admission was required for one (2.3%) patient on the weekly regimen and none on the 2 weekly regimen .
1161 questionnaires were obtained from the 385 patients in the intention-to-treat population .
The survival advantage was reached ,  despite a higher proportion of patients receiving further chemotherapy in the no-irinotecan group (58.3 vs 39.4%) .
This study population was large (385 patients treated) ,  and the patients were representative of candidates for first-line chemotherapy in clinical practice ,  except that an unexpectedly high proportion of them had synchronous metastases at baseline and ,  consequently ,  a relatively low proportion of them had had previous adjuvant chemotherapy .
Another phase III study that compared irinotecan combined with bolus fluorouracil and fluorouracil alone consistently provided significantly higher response rates (33 vs 18% ,  p<0.001) and median time to treatment failure (5.0 vs 3.8 months ,  p<0.05) in the irinotecan group .
The results we achieved with the irinotecan combination treatment show that the addition of irinotecan to weekly or 2-weekly regimens of fluorouracil and calcium folinate by infusion brings clear clinical benefit and should be considered as a first-line reference treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer as well as for advanced disease .
