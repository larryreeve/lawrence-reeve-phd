Adjuvant chemotherapy of colorectal cancer has been tested in several randomised trials .
More evidence has emerged lately ,  however ,  that adjuvant chemotherapy of colon cancer may be beneficial .
Overt liver metastases seem to be the first site of relapse for 40-50%of patients with operable disease .
Patients and methods .
29 patients had liver metastases diagnosed at resection and 8 had incomplete resection .
The analysis was therefore based on 505 patients (table 1) .
5 patients were lost to follow-up .
Mitomycin was given to78-8% of the patients assigned it .
The group assigned perioperative portal chemotherapy had significantly higher 5-year disease-free survival than the control group (table 2) .
At median follow-up of 96 months ,  235 patients had died; 108 in the infusion group and 127 in the control group .
5-year overall survival was also higher in the infusion group (table 2) .
The infusion group had fewer local recurrences and liver metastases with or without relapses at other sites than the control group (table 4) .
Among node-negative patients ,  local relapses were less frequent in those who received infusion treatment .
1 patient in each group died of myocardial infarction ,  2 patients in the control group died of refractory small-bowel obstruction ,  and 3 patients in each group died of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative septicaemia .
The infusion group had a higher rate of repeat laparotomy and haemorrhage than the control group ,  especially after abdominoperineal resection of rectal cancer .
Transient leucopenia (<3 X10 white blood cells per L) developed in 6 patients during adjuvant chemotherapy ,  and the white-blood-cell count was significantly lower on postoperative days 7 and 10 in the infusion group than in the control group .
This trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase survival in patients with colorectal cancer .
Adjuvant portal chemotherapy was tolerated without an increase in complications compared with untreated patients .
We did find ,  however ,  a consistent reduction of all kinds of tumour recurrences that resulted in a significant advantage in overall survival and disease-free survival for patients treated with adjuvant portal infusion ,  confirming previous findings .
Most were multicentre trials and some excluded patients with rectal cancer .
Two as yet unpublished meta-analyses of all randomised trials comparing portal adjuvant chemotherapy with a no-treatment control group have been conducted by the European Organization on Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Oxford Colorectal Cancer Cooperative Group .
This low incidence of surgical complications suggests advances in surgical technique and in patient management before and after elective cancer surgery ,  that allow safe use of adjuvant chemotherapy soon after surgical intervention .
