Radical external beam plus intracavitary radiation continues to be the standard therapy for advanced cervical cancer to which all new therapies must be compared .
An analysis of the patterns of failure after radiation therapy in locally advanced cervical cancer reveals that of those who recur over 70% have some component of pelvic failure as the first site of relapse and two-thirds develop some component of distant disease .
These include modifications of radiation treatment volume or fractionation including extended field radiation ,  hyperfractionated RT ,  strategies to overcome the negative impact of tumor hypoxia such as hyperbaric oxygen ,  or hypoxic cell radiation sensitizers .
In addition to modifications of radiation therapy multiple studies have investigated ,  and are investigating ,  strategies that combine radiation with chemotherapy either as neoadjuvant or concurrent administration .
These advantages include no delay in the start of definitive irradiation ,  no prolongation of overall treatment time (thus minimizing the theoretical risk of accelerated clonogen proliferation during the antineoplastic course) ,  and possible interaction of the concurrently administered chemotherapy with radiation through such mechanisms as inhibition of repair of radiation damage ,  cell synchronization ,  recruitment of nonproliferating cells into cell cycle ,  and reduction of the hypoxic fraction .
Theoretical disadvantages of concurrent administration include increased acute toxicity which might limit or delay the delivery of definitive irradiation or increased late toxicity particularly if the drugs and radiation do not exhibit ‘‘toxicity’’ independence .
While these studies suggested some benefit for patients with FIGO stage IIIB cancer ,  methodological problems in the study have not resulted in wide acceptance of the conclusion of benefit from concurrent hydroxyurea and its concurrent use has not entered standard practice .
Interest in infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with or without other agents such as mitomycin C and cisplatin ,  developed from both laboratory data suggesting enhanced tumor cell kill over radiation alone and clinical data .
The optimal dosing schedule for maximizing cell kill with infusional 5-FU and radiation remains undefined ,  but laboratory data suggested greater effects with increasing dose and prolonged exposure to 5-FU and when drug was present for intervals in excess of 48 h after radiation .
All patients were to have tumors 5 cm or greater regardless of FIGO stage (stages IB ,  II ,  IVA) .
Eligible patients were to have biopsy proven invasive carcinoma of the cervix of any pathological type excluding small cell carcinoma and to have primary radiotherapy with curative intent selected as their definitive treatment .
Exclusion criteria included preexisting malignancy except basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin .
A screening chest X-ray was to be negative for metastases and if lymphography or abdominal CT scanning was performed ,  there should be no apparent evidence of involvement of the para-aortic nodes .
The protocol was reviewed by the ethics committees of the involved universities and hospitals and patients gave informed consent for study .
Patients were randomized to receive either (a) standard external beam pelvic irradiation (EBRT) in a dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions defined at 100% versus ,  (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional intravenous 5-FU in a dose of 1 g/m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  (c) partially hyperfractionated RT ,  5280 cGy in 33 fractions ,  2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  or (d) arm (c) with the same infusional 5-FU .
A posterior midline attenuator of two half value layers ,  3 cm in width at the midplane of the pelvis was used to reduce the dose to the bladder and rectum .
For rare patients with disease extension to the lower one-third of vagina ,  the first application to the cervix and uterus was modified to deliver 30 Gy at 2 cm from the center of the sources and a second application as a line source in the vagina ,  was used to deliver a further 20 Gy at 0.5 cm depth from the surface of the vagina. 5-FU was given as an infusion from days 1 to 4 inclusive and on treatment days 22 to 25 inclusive .
Appropriate guidelines for 5-FU dosage reduction or elimination were recommended for hematologic or mucosal toxicity ,  but RT interruptions were not .
Figure 1 demonstrates the study design ,  the four-arm study was designed to determine whether any significant differences in outcome were evident between arms (a) and (d) and to be explanatory with respect to causation .
Assuming that the magnitude and direction of the 5-FU effects were similar in arms (b) and (d) then the effect of the addition of 5-FU could be tested by comparing arms (b) and (d) with arms (a) and (c) .
The reduced fraction size in arms (c) and (d) was designed to attempt to take advantage of knowledge of the affect of fraction size on late complications and to determine whether complication rates were decreased by using decreased fraction size .
Additionally ,  the changed fractionation scheme with delivery of two fractions daily at the beginning and end of therapy was designed to maximize the potential for interaction between 5-FU and radiation and to potentially reduce complication rates .
The effect of the fractionation was to be tested by comparing arms (c) and (d) with arms (a) and (b) (Fig. 1) .
In order to detect a 20% improvement in pelvic control rate from an expected 50% for arm (a) to 70% for arm (d) assuming an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.20 ,  73 patients in each of four treatment arms would be required for a total of 292 patients .
In order to detect an improvement of 15% in survival in arms (c) and (d) compared to that seen in arms (a) and (b) ,  assuming a 40% cause-specific survival rate in arm (a) and an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.2 ,  the total number of patients required was 272 .
Severe late or chronic bowel symptoms were those of fistula ,  perforation ,  stricture ,  or obstruction requiring hospitalization or surgery and bleeding requiring transfusion .
Severe bladder symptoms were any condition requiring surgery ,  e.g. ,  fistula ,  or hematuria requiring transfusion .
Oral mucositis due to 5-FU was graded on a scale of 0 to 4 ,  (1) pain without frank ulceration ,  (2) ulceration present but able to eat ,  (3) ulceration requiring a liquid diet ,  (4) alimentation not possible .
Cytopenias were classed as grade 3 if bleeding or infection/fever occurred due to low blood counts and grade 2 if neutrophils were less than 1000 units/L or platelets less than 50,000 units/L .
Thereasons for exclusion were the presence of extrapelvic disease at presentation in 7 ,  patient refusal after randomization in 4 ,  and missing chart/information in 2 .
For strata 1 and 2 the distribution of FIGO stage ,  tumor size ,  nodal involvement on lymphography ,  tumor grade ,  and capillary lymphatic space involvement (CLS) for each treatment are shown in Tables 1 and 2 .
In the ‘‘partially hyperfractionated irradiation arm’’ (c) ,  two patients had radiation dose violations ,  one a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions and the other a dose of 59 Gy in 33 fractions .
Of the 23 patients who received no intracavitary radiation or doses less than 500 cGy ,  there was a relatively even distribution across the treatment arms with 5 in arm (a) ,  5 in arm (b) ,  3 in arm (c) ,  and 9 in arm (d) .
One hundred and eighty-seven of 221 patients had squamous cell carcinoma ,  17 adenocarcinoma ,  12 adenosquamous ,  and the remainder clear cell or unclassified .
The disease free 5-year survival in arm (a) ,  (c) ,  (d) ,  and (b) ,  respectively , were 45 ,  53 ,  58 ,  and 61% .
The overall pelvic control by treatment assigned for arms (a) ,  (c) ,  (d) ,  and (b) was 58 ,  65 ,  68 ,  and 69% ,  respectively .
Since significant differences in pelvic control and survival were observed in stratum 1 which contained only 99 patients ,  it is important to examine whether there was an uneven distribution of other possible patient or tumor-related prognostic factors across the treatment arms to account for the differences observed .
Other than the report on the use of concurrent hydroxyurea this is the first published report of the results of a randomized study examining the role of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation in advanced cervical cancer .
To reach the conclusion that concurrent chemotherapy truly adds benefit to results achievable with radiation alone ,  it is important that the radiation be delivered in an optimal manner with adequate doses at ‘‘Point A’’ (80 to 90 Gy) and limited overall treatment times .
However ,  in stratum 1 constituted of patients with stage IB/IIA and those IIB tumors with medial parametrial involvement ,  a significant improvement in both pelvic control and disease-free survival in favor of standard radiation with concurrent 5-FU was observed (Figs. 5 and 6) .
The tumor- and patient-related factors examined were FIGO stage (IB versus IIA versus IIB) ,  size of tumor (greater or less than 6 cm and greater or less than 7 cm) ,  grade of tumor the presence or absence of capillary-like space involvement ,  nodal involvement ,  and patient age as a continuous variable .
The treatment related factors examined were the use of intracavitary radiation ,  the use of 5-FU ,  and the fractionation scheme ,  standard versus partially hyperfractionated .
