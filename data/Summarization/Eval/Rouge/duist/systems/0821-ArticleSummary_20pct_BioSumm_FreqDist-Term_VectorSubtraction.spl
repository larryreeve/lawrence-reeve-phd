THE ANTIMETABOLITES methotrexate (MTX) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) have become established over the past quarter century among the most useful cancer chemotherapeutic agents .
Sequential administration of moderate doses of MTX followed by 5-FU has been reported effective in advanced head and neck cancer and colorectal cancer ,  as well as breast cancer ,  but the importance of the sequence remains uncertain .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Patients eligible for this study had measurable or evaluable advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck , adenocarcinoma of the colon ,  rectum or stomach ,  or SCC of other primary site (Table I) .
Histopathologic confirmation of diagnosis .
Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the requirements of the institutional ethics committee .
SEQUENTIAL MTX/5-FU .
One hour later by MTX (FM) .
RESULTS .
There were 24 patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma ,  all with symptomatic advanced disease ,  and five with advanced gastric carcinoma .
The remaining nine patients had metastatic or recurrent SCC of other primary site .
Other factors including stage ,  sex ,  prior radiotherapy ,  and prior surgery were not significant .
Responses were seen among the small number of patients with other cancers (Table 3) .
DISCUSSION .
Both treatments were effective in head and neck cancer (Table 3) .
In the small number of patients with colorectal cancer we observed a response rate of 33% (40% of evaluable patients) ,  a figure somewhat higher than that usually seen after 5-FU as a single agent ,  but the 95% confidence limits for this rate (19%-64%) emphasize that this could be a chance observation .
The trial is continuing ,  and has recently been widened to include patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma .
