Stratification was by primary versus recurrent tumors and by tumor diameter greater than or equal to 10 cm versus less than 10 cm. One hundred four patients were randomized ,  51 to the control group and 53 to the treatment group (five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin 60 mg/m2 days 1 and 2 and ifosfamide 1.8 g/m2 days 1 through 5 ,  with hydration ,  mesna ,  and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) .
After a median follow-up of 59 months ,  60 patients had relapsed and 48 died (28 and 20 in the treatment arm and 32 and 28 in the control arm ,  respectively) .
The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 48 months in the treatment group and 16 months in the control group (P = .04) ,  and the median overall survival (OS) was 75 months for treated and 46 months for untreated patients (P = .03) .
The treatment of limb sarcomas mainly relies on a combined-modality approach ,  after the demonstration that pre-or postoperative radiation and conservative surgery led to local control in a high proportion of patients.4 In fact ,  limb-sparing procedures allow an 85% to 90% local dis-ease-free survival (DFS) rate and demolitive surgery now represents only 5% to 10% of the operations in comparison with the 50% survival rate of the 1960s to 1970s .
Here we report the results of the Italian co-operative study after a median follow-up of 59 months and a minimum time between randomization and date last seen of 28 months among patients who did not die .
Inclusion criteria were as follows ,  age ,  18 to 65 years ,  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2 ,  primary tumors subfascially localized with diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm ,  high-grade spindle-cell or polymorphous sarcomas (fibrosarcoma ,  malignant fibrous histiocytoma ,  polymorphous liposarcoma ,  leiomyosarcoma ,  synovial sarcoma ,  malignant schwannoma ,  angiosarcoma ,  and polymorphous rhabdomyosarcoma) ,  local relapse of any size ,  no previous radio/chemotherapy ,  adequate bone marrow (WBC count of >= 4,000/fiL ,  platelets = 120.000/mL ,  and hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL) ,  renal (creatinine <= 1.3 mg/dL) ,  hepatic (SGOT <= 2.5 X normal value and bilirubin <= 1.2 mg/dL) ,  and pulmonary functions .
Chemotherapy ,  repeated every 3 weeks ,  consisted of five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin (EPI) 60 mg/m2/die ,  in a short intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1 and 2 (total dose per cycle ,  120 mg/m2) ,  IFO 1.8 g/m2/die diluted in 500 mL of normal saline and administered over 1 hour on days 1 through 5 (total dose per cycle ,  9 g/m2) ,  and 6-mercapto-ethansulfonate in a bolus IV injection at 20% of the IFO dose ,  given before and 4 and 8 hours after the IFO infusions .
In the case of incomplete hematologic recovery (defined as WBC < 4,000/mL and platelets [PLTS] < 100.000/mL) ,  treatment was postponed by one or more weeks ,  furthermore ,  on complete hematologic recovery ,  a dose reduction of EPI was applied depending on the observed nadirs (WBC > 1,000/mL and PLTS > 75.000/mL ,  IFO and EPI doses both 100% ,  WBC > 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL ,  IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 75% ,  WBC < 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL ,  IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 50%) .
On the basis of the estimated proportions of patients free from metastatic disease 2 years after diagnosis (60% in the treated group v 40% in the control group) ,  it was estimated that 95 patients were required per arm (beta = 0.80 ,  alpha = 0.05) .
All centers faxed protocol-specific eligibility checklists to the statistics office in Aviano ,  patients were stratified using a four-block stratification by primary tumor (diameter < 10 cm v >= 10 cm) and recurrent tumor (diameter < 10 cm v >= 10 cm) and randomized to treatment or control groups .
Overall DFS was defined as the time between randomization and the first recurrence ,  and OS was defined as the time between randomization and death as a result of disease (patients dying in complete remission were considered as censored on the date of death for OS) .
The remaining 68 patients (65%) were treated using a limb-sparing procedure involving radiation therapy and surgery ,  45 underwent surgery and postoperative radiation therapy ,  and 24 underwent preoperative radiation therapy and conservative surgery (Table 1) .
One patient refused the fifth and last cycle for personal reasons ,  and three patients did not complete the treatment because of related toxicities (reappearance of viral uveitis ,  consecutive episodes of pneumonitis ,  and persistent leukopenia) after two ,  three ,  and four cycles ,  respectively .
At the time of statistical analysis (November 1999) ,  the median follow-up for the 104 patients included in the study was 59 months ,  61 months in the treatment arm and 55 months in the control arm .
During the follow-up period ,  disease recurrences were recorded in 28 of the 53 treated patients and in 32 of the 51 patients who did not undergo adjuvant therapy ,  20 treated patients and 28 untreated patients died .
Univariate analyses did not reveal any statistically significant difference in overall DFS and OS for any of the characteristics considered (age ,  sex ,  center of surgery ,  histology ,  grading ,  site of primary tumor ,  presentation ,  diameter ,  local treatment ,  and stratification) with the exception of adjuvant treatment (data not shown) .
Sixty first events (local ,  distant only ,  and synchronous distant and local) were observed overall (32 in the control arm and 28 in the treatment arm) .
In four patients ,  the first event was a synchronous local relapse with metastases (one patient in the control arm and three patients in the treatment arm) .
Furthermore ,  nine patients developed metachronous relapse at a different site (three were local relapse after a metastasis and six were distant relapses after a previous local relapse) .
Patients in the treated arm experienced a 41% reduction in the risk of disease relapse (HR ,  0.59 ,  95% CI ,  0.36 to 0.99 ,  P = .04) (Fig 2) .
The absolute improvement deriving from chemotherapy was 27% at 2 years (72% and 45% in the treatment and control arms ,  respectively ,  P = .003) ,  and 13% at 4 years (50% and 37% ,  respectively ,  P = .19) (Table 5) .
Overall ,  13 patients had a local recurrence of disease as the first relapse without simultaneous distant metastases (four patients in the treatment arm and nine patients in the control arm ,  Table 4) .
The cumulative incidence function estimates at 2 years were 0% and 10% for the treatment and the control arms ,  respectively (P = .02) ,  and at 4 years ,  they were 6% and 17% ,  respectively (P = .09) (Table 5) .
Overall ,  patients in the treatment arm had an indication of reduction in the risk of local recurrence (P = .07) .
Four patients had local relapses simultaneously with metastasis (one patient in the control arm and three in the treatment arm) ,  and another three patients developed a local relapse as the second relapse after a distant metastasis (two patients in the treatment arm and one patient in the control arm) .
Taking into account the overall local relapse rate (all local events observed) ,  11 patients in the control group and nine in the treatment group experienced local failure .
The distribution between the different local treatment modalities (radical surgery ,  surgery and postoperative radiation therapy ,  and preoperative radiation therapy and surgery) was respectively ,  two of 16 patients ,  seven of 20 ,  and two of 15 for the control group and three of 20 patients ,  six of 24 ,  and zero of nine for the treatment group .
As the first event ,  a total of 47 distant relapses were observed (22 single distant events in the control group and 21 in the treatment group ,  one synchronous distant and local event in the control group and three in the treatment group Table 4) .
The estimated cumulative incidence function at 2 years was 28% for the control arm and 45% for the treatment arm (P = .08) ,  at 4 years it was 44% and 45% ,  respectively (P = .94) .
Six additional patients (four in the control arm and two in the treatment arm) had a distant metastasis as a second relapse after a local relapse .
The median survival time was higher among patients who underwent adjuvant therapy (75 months) ,  compared with untreated patients (46 months) (Fig 4) .
The absolute improvement deriving from chemotherapy was 13% at 2 years (85% and 72% in the treatment and control arms ,  respectively ,  P = .10) ,  and the improvement increased to 19% at 4 years (69% and 50% ,  P = .04) (Table 5) .
The preliminary data of previous studies were sometimes positive for DFS and OS , 15-19 but further analyses ,  made after an adequate follow-up time ,  indicated a disappearance of the positive effect of chemotherapy on 20,21 and ,  in some cases ,  worse results.22 However ,  the recently published meta-analysis , 7 involving 1,568 patients ,  showed a statistically significant benefit for treated patients of 6% ,  10% ,  and 10% for local ,  metastatic ,  and overall DFS ,  respectively ,  and a favorable (but not statistically significant) trend in OS (4%) ,  after a median of 9.4 years of follow-up .
Furthermore ,  in the subgroup of 886 patients  affected by extremity sarcomas ,  the difference in OS between treated and untreated patients was significant (P = .029) ,  and the absolute benefit after 10 years increased to 7% .
It is directly derived from consecutive phase I-II dose-intensification trials carried out at the Centro di Riferimento Oncologico of Aviano.27,31 The epirubicin dose level of 60 mg/m2 X 2 days represents the step before the maximum-tolerated dose established in those trials (70 mg/m2 epirubicin X 2 days) when given in combination with fixed full doses of ifosfamide (1.8 g/m2/d X 5 days) in advanced cases of soft tissue sarcoma .
The main finding of the intention-to-treat analysis in this study is the beneficial impact of chemotherapy on the DFS (P = .04) and OS (P = .03) for patients affected by high-risk extremity soft tissue sarcomas and treated with chemotherapy .
However ,  between the three different local approaches there was a trend in favor of preoperative radiation therapy (two local relapse of 24 patients in the control arm ,  8.3%) .
Moreover ,  this treatment option5,32,33 was chosen for those patients presenting with locally far-advanced disease or with disease approaching critical structures (nerves and vessels) ,  therefore a high incidence of local relapse could be foreseen .
Questions regarding the adequacy of the surgical approach and consequently the adequacy of margins could be raised ,  but only 10 patients were treated outside of referral centers and only two of those patients had local relapses .
