Most studies have shown no significant treatment effects ,  and a meta-analysis to test the hypothesis of no effect was unable to dismiss this possibility .
More evidence has emerged lately ,  however ,  that adjuvant chemotherapy of colon cancer may be beneficial .
Based on these results ,  several prospective randomised comparisons of intraportal infusion of various regimens after surgery and surgery alone were initiated .
Access to the portal vein was through any side branch of the mesenteric venous system .
All randomised patients were followed up for recurrence and survival every 3 months for 1 year then every 6 months .
Examinations included blood counts ,  serum carcinoembryonic antigen measurement ,  and hepatic and renal function tests .
Disease-free survival was defined as the time from surgery to relapse ,  the appearance of a second primary cancer ,  or death ,  whichever occurred first .
The hazard ratio for relapse (all events to mid-1992) of treated compared with untreated patients was 0-79 (95% CI 0.62-1.00 , p=0.051) .
The advantage is most pronounced around 5 years after randomisation .
Among node-negative patients ,  local relapses were less frequent in those who received infusion treatment .
The cytotoxic infusion was judged to be a contributory factor in 1 of the latter cases .
White-blood-cell counts returned to normal during the hospital stay in all but 1 patient .
This trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase survival in patients with colorectal cancer .
Adjuvant portal chemotherapy was tolerated without an increase in complications compared with untreated patients .
Most were multicentre trials and some excluded patients with rectal cancer .
Two as yet unpublished meta-analyses of all randomised trials comparing portal adjuvant chemotherapy with a no-treatment control group have been conducted by the European Organization on Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Oxford Colorectal Cancer Cooperative Group .
Our randomised three-arm study (control vs portal vs systemic adjuvant therapy) was carried out between 1987 and 1993 in 770 patients .
The median observation time will soon reach 5 years and the first survival analysis will be undertaken .
This low incidence of surgical complications suggests advances in surgical technique and in patient management before and after elective cancer surgery ,  that allow safe use of adjuvant chemotherapy soon after surgical intervention .
