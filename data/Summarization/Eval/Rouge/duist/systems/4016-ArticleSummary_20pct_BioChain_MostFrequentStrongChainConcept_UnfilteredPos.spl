Introduction .
For these patients ,  treatment  with fluorouracil ,  usually modulated by folinic acid ,  is  the only option and the median survival is  10-12 months .
Survival is short and associated with weight  loss ,  onset or worsening of tumour-related symptoms ,  and poor quality of life .
In first-line chemotherapy ,  fluorouracil with folinic-acid is  better than supportive care (or delayed chemotherapy) for survival and quality of life ,  but the value of second-line chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer has  not yet been proven .
The trial we report was started in 1995 to compare irinotecan with supportive care alone for survival ,  quality  of life ,  and other clinical variables .
Overall survival was the primary endpoint .
The secondary objectives were the impact of treatment on performance status ,  bodyweight , tumour-related symptoms ,  and quality of life .
Quality of life .
Quality of life was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire (including five function scales ,  one global health-status scale ,  and nine symptom scales) ,  which was filled in at  baseline ,  at 3 weeks ,  6 weeks ,  and then every 6 weeks .
Survival curves were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method on the randomised population and compared by a two-tailed logrank test .
Survival without weight  loss of more than 5% survival without performance-status  deterioration ,  and pain-free survival were estimated by the   Kaplan-Meier method and compared with a two-tailed logrank  test .
Quality-of-life variables were compared with multivariate and univariate analyses of variance on values at baseline ,  during  study ,  on patients' worst score over the trial period ,  and changes  from baseline .
Overall survival .
The survival probability for this group at  6 months was 72.2% ,  at 9 months 52.6% ,  and at  12 months 36.2% .
This benefit appeared after 2 months and became more apparent throughout the study period.  1-year survival was 36.2% and 13.8% in the irinotecan and supportive-care groups ,  respectively .
Median  survival was 9.2 and 6.5 months ,  respectively .
The survival  probability for this group at 6 months was 76.3% ,  at  9 months 57.2% ,  and at 12 months 40.1% .
The survival probability for  this group at 6 months was 46.2% ,  at 9 months 26.9% ,  and at 12 months 15.4% .
When the  treatment group was included in the model , the survival benefit for the irinotecan group remained significant (p=0.001) .
Survival without weight loss of more than 5% (p=0.018) and survival without performance-status deterioration (p=0.0001) were significantly longer in the irinotecan group .
Pain-free survival in patients without pain at baseline (figure 4) was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the supportive-care group (p=0.003) ,  despite a higher proportion of patients on opioids in the supportive-care group .
The  survival probability for this group at 6 months was 56.8% ,  at 9 months 36.6% ,  and at 12 months 18.8% .
The univariate analyses of variance were significantly in favour of the irinotecan group for the cognitive functioning score (p.0.001) ,  the global quality-of-life  score (p<0.001) ,  the pain score (p=0.008) ,  dyspnoea  (p=0.04) ,  appetite loss (p<0.002) ,  and financial-impact scores (p<0.001) .
Other efficacy endpoints ,  such as survival without weight loss ,  survival  without performance status deterioration ,  pain-free survival ,  and quality-of-life ,  were all significantly in  favour of irinotecan .
The survival advantage for the irinotecan group remained highly significant after adjustment of performance status ,  a well-recognised prognostic  factor .
The survival data were also consistent with those observed in the phase II studies of irinotecan .
We have shown a survival advantage and a clinical benefit from second-line chemotherapy in patients with  metastatic colorectal cancer no longer responding to fluorouracil .
