Although a large number of alternative drugs have been studied in colorectal cancer ,  none has exceeded the meager effectiveness of 5-FU .
Thymidine given at high doses in animal model systems has been shown to increase both therapeutic activity and toxicity of 5-FU and to improve the therapeutic index of this agent .
In the study of Woodcock et al ,  the single colorectal cancer patient treated who was not a prior 5-FU failure had a response of 8 months duration .
The first was a small surgical adjuvant study reported by Verhaegen et al in which levamisole-treated patients had a significantly improved survival when compared with untreated controls .
In 1981 ,  a New York Memorial study reported a 32% objective response rate among 77 patients treated with MOF-Strept .
In a randomized trial ,  this group showed that this combination produced superior response rates and survival when compared with their own variant of the 5-FU ,  methyl CCNU ,  vincristine combination .
Contraindications to selection included a WBC count < 4.000/mm or a platelet count < 130.000/mm. a serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL. complete disability (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group IECOG] performance score 4). recent major surgery (exploration and biopsy only. < 14 days ,  resection or bypass surgery ,  < 21 days) ,  an uncontrolled infectious process. frequent vomiting or severe anorexia ,  any previous chemotherapy ,  and intensive radiation to the axial skeleton within the preceding 4 weeks .
Courses of therapy were repeated every 5 weeks. 5-FU plus levamisole. 5-FU was administered in undiluted form by rapid IV injection at a dose of 500 mg/m 2/d for 5 consecutive days .
The evaluation consisted of a history and physical examination ,  measurement of indicator lesions. hematology and chemistry panel (including serum creatinine) ,  urinalysis ,  and a chest x-ray .
The log rank statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with equality of survival curves ,  while the Cox partial likelihood score statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with the hypothesis that any one of the combinations would yield at least a 50% improvement in survival over 5-FU alone .
These reactions were primarily headache (seven patients) ,  lethargy (four patients) ,  dizziness with ataxia (four patients) ,  and occasional confusion (two patients) .
It is noteworthy that while the MOF-Strept regimen had the highest regression rate ,  it was also the regimen with the lowest proportion of patients whose disease remained stable and the highest proportion of patients in whom the best response observed was tumor regression .
The median interval to progression for all patients was 3/V2 months .
The dose-limiting mucocutaneous toxicity that we observed undoubtedly represented the additive effects of both agents .
An interesting sidelight of this study is the fact that grade of tumor anaplasia was found to be a powerful prognostic determinant ,  matching the more well-established performance status and presence or absence of measurable disease .
Whereas the results of this study were negative ,  these should not discourage continued efforts to exploit the biochemical modulation approaches .
