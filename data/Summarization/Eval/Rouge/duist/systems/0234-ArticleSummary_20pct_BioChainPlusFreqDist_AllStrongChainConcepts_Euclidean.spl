It possesses a broad spectrum of clinical antitumor efficacy and is the most active nonhormonal drug for the treatment of breast cancer .
Its use ,  however ,  is limited by cumulative ,  dose-dependent ,  chronic cardiotoxicity .
More recently ,  however ,  subclinical cardiac injury has been documented at considerably lower doses .
Discontinuation of therapy in these patients may prevent cardiac failure ,  but also results in curtailment of the antineoplastic effect of DOX .
Blood counts were initially monitored weekly ,  and then less frequently after the pattern of myelosuppression was established .
Biochemical profiles were repeated every six weeks .
All evaluable or measurable parameters of disease were reevaluated at least every six weeks .
Randomization was performed using the method of random permuted blocks ,  which assured an equal number of patients in each arm at specified time points .
It was anticipated that these doses would produce equivalent degrees of myelosuppression .
Exercise was continued until the patient achieved the maximum predicted heart rate or until limited by fatigue ,  severe dyspnea ,  or chest pain .
Therefore ,  for this study laboratory cardiac toxicity was defined as decrease in resting LVEF of > 10% from pretreatment baseline or a decrease in LVEF with stress of > 5% from the resting baseline obtained on the same day .
Statistical MethodsComparison of response rates between the two arms was made using a chi-square test .
Several other comparisons ,  such as percent of projected dose ,  used the two-sample Wilcoxon test .
RESULTSPatient CharacteristicsA total of 54 women were randomized ,  25 to the EPI arm and 29 to the DOX arm .
Although all patients had received prior chemotherapy which included cyclophosphamide or other alkylating agent ,  no patient had been previously treated with mitomycin C .
Other common toxicities included nausea ,  vomiting ,  and alopecia .
In general ,  the nausea and vomiting in patients on the EPI arm was less severe .
As noted above ,  the doses of the drugs were adjusted to produce an equivalent degree of myelosuppression .
Thus ,  all EPI doses were multiplied by 52/85 to compare the two drugs in equivalent units ,  and Kaplan-Meier estimates plotted (Fig 2B) .
The difference remains statistically significant with a P value of .04 .
A decrease in LVEF of > 5% with stress was not observed in the absence of a > 10% decrease in resting LVEF from baseline .
Thus ,  for this patient population ,  the use of exercise did not appear to increase the sensitivity of the resting RNCA alone .
Survival analysis methods were also applied to compare the cumulative doses to clinical CHF for patients in the two arms .
Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the cardiotoxic effects of DOX .
The use of potentially cardioprotective agents such as vitamin E ,  N-acetylcysteine ,  and ICRF-187 has been suggested ,  but the data have not been sufficiently promising to warrant large scale clinical trials .
Recently ,  liposomal encapsulation of DOX has been shown to decrease the cardiotoxicity of DOX in experimental animals ,  although it is unknown whether the drug's antineoplastic effects are preserved .
In nonrandomized trials ,  the use of a weekly DOX schedule has been reported to permit administration of a higher total dose of the drug .
A combination of RNCA and endomyocardial biopsy is recommended for the individual patient at high risk for whom a therapeutic decision must be made .
Although endomyocardial biopsy is probably the definitive measure of cardiac injury ,  RNCA has the advantage of being noninvasive and ,  therefore ,  acceptable to virtually all patients in a randomized study of antineoplastic agents .
Potential selection factors that might bias the comparison of cardiac effects are thereby avoided .
This is similar to the 27% response rate reported by the Early Clinical Trials Group of the EORTC (European Organization for the Research on Treatment of Cancer) .
The therapeutic index of an agent is defined by the relationship between the dosage required to produce therapeutic and toxic effects and by the magnitude of the favorable or unfavorable effects observed .
Whether these findings reflect an improvement in therapeutic index is dependent on the two drugs' dose relationship for therapeutic effects .
There are three prospective randomized comparison studies that address this issue in patients with breast cancer .
At cumulative EPI doses of 600 to 700 mg/m2 ,  two (13%) of the 15 evaluable patients at risk for RNCA changes developed a decrease in LVEF of > 10% .
In the other single agent study ,  in which there was an empiric dose limitation of 600 mg/m2 ,  none of the seven EPItreated patients who had RNCA experienced a decline in LVEF of > 10% .
In the multidrug study ,  no clinical cardiac dysfunction was seen in the EPI-containing (FEC) arm .
The relatively good cardiac tolerance of EPI observed in the present breast cancer study has been confirmed in our extended phase II experience in other disorders .
The sudden onset of clinical deterioration was also reported byBristow who considered this a manifestation of a nonlinear relationship between myocardial structure and function.3 6 Likewise ,  changes in LVEF in response to stress frequently accompanied a decline in LVEF ,  but we did not observe such a decline without a concommittant change in resting LVEF .
Just as schedule modification has reduced the cardiotoxic effects of DOX ,  22 exploration of a weekly schedule of EPI administration is warranted .
