Women were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria ,  disease outside the pelvic area or spread to para-aortic lymph nodes ,  a prior cancer other than cutaneous basal-cell carcinoma ,  medical contraindications to chemotherapy ,  a rare histologic subtype ,  and prior hysterectomy or transperitoneal staging procedure for cervical cancer ,  pelvic radiotherapy ,  or systemic chemotherapy .
External-beam radiation was delivered with anteroposterior and posteroanterior opposed beams of at least 15-MV photons or the use of four fields (anteroposterior ,  posteroanterior ,  and two lateral fields) of at least 4-MV photons .
To avoid treatment delays ,  intracavitary insertions were performed without chemotherapy if a patient had a granulocyte count of less than 1500 per cubic millimeter and a platelet count of less than 100,000 per cubic millimeter .
Disease status and the degree of treatment-related toxic effects were assessed by history taking ,  physical examination ,  and appropriate laboratory and radiologic tests .
Toxicity was assessed at the time of each evaluation with use of the Cooperative Group Common Toxicity Criteria ,  the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria ,  and the Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme of the RTOG and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer .
Radiotherapy records ,  including data concerning external-beam fields ,  intracavitary placement ,  doses of radiation to tumor and normal tissues ,  and other treatment variables ,  were reviewed by a radiation oncologist .
Overall survival was the primary end point for the comparison of the two treatments and was calculated from the date of study entry until the date of death or the date of the last follow-up visit .
Five-year rates of secondary end points such as locoregional recurrence ,  para-aortic recurrence ,  and distant metastasis were estimated with the use of cumulative-incidence methods , and treatment effects were tested with use of the Gray algorithm .
Fifteen patients (4 percent) — six in the combined-therapy group and nine in the radiotherapy group — were subsequently disqualified because of failure to undergo the required evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (eight patients) ,  the presence of extrapelvic cancer (two) ,  the presence of a rare histologic subtype (one) ,  the presence of a stage IB1 tumor with no involvement of pelvic nodes (one) ,  the absence of pretreatment data (two) ,  and receipt of chemotherapy before radiotherapy (one) .
The median total duration of radiation was 58 days ,  with a mean dose of 89 Gy delivered to point A in each group .
There was no significant difference in overall survival between treatment groups among patients who had stage III or IVA disease ,  although  the study was not designed to have a sufficient number of patients in these subgroups to test for a statistically significant difference .
Although the group reported significant improvements in overall and disease-free survival with the addition of hydroxyurea therapy ,  the study has been criticized for the use of a low dose of radiation and the poor survival rates in both groups and because more than half of the 190 patients who were enrolled could not be evaluated .
Despite these criticisms ,  the resultsof that study and those of trials assessing concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy for other tumors stimulated studies of the effects of radiotherapy and various combinations of fluorouracil ,  cisplatin ,  mitomycin ,  carboplatin ,  and paclitaxel as treatments for locally advanced cervical cancer.The results of these trials have been encouraging ,  but mostclinicians have not found them sufficiently  convincing to justify the inclusion of chemotherapy in the routine treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer .
The results of the Patterns of Care studies and large retrospective analyses suggest that these features correlate with survival rates and rates of local control of cervical cancer .
We also used a somewhat more aggressive regimen of chemotherapy than have other groups .
