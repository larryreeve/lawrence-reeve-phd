We randomly assigned patients irinotecan combined with fluorouracil and calcium folinate (irinotecan group) or fluorouracil and calcium folinate only (no-irinotecan group ,  figure 1) .
These regimens were used for combined treatment and fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone .
Further cancer treatment was also recorded .
We needed to include 338 evaluable patients to show a significant difference in response rate between treatment groups ,  assuming response rates of 35% in the no-irinotecan group and 50% in the irinotecan group ,  by use of two-tailed X tests (a=0.05 ,  power 0.80) .
Based on the assumption that time to progression would be 6 months in the no-irinotecan group and 9 months in the irinotecan group ,  we calculated that 286 patients were needed to show a significant difference for this variable .
Two patients received no study treatment because consent was withdrawn .
Of the 385 patients treated in the study ,  only 97 (25%) received treatment by the weekly regimen (54 in the irinotecan group and 43 in the no-irinotecan group) .
The other 288 patients received treatment every 2 weeks (145 in the irinotecan group and 143 in the no-irinotecan group) .
A higher proportion of women were assigned fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone than the irinotecan regimen ,  and the rectum was the primary tumour site in a higher proportion of patients in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group .
39.4% of patients in the irinotecan group and 58.3% in the no-irinotecan group received further chemotherapy; 31.0% of the no-irinotecan group subseqently received irinotecan .
Similar proportions of patients received further treatment with oxaliplatin in the two groups (15.7 vs 12.8%) .
In the evaluable population ,  the response rate was 49% in the irinotecan group ,  compared with 31% in the noirinotecan group (p<0.001) .
The median duration of response was 9.3 (2.8-13.1) months in the irinotecan group and 8.8 (3.7-11.8) months in the no-irinotecan group (p=0.08) .
The interaction between treatment and regimen was not significant .
Median followirinotecan group was 69.8% and 54.8% ,  respectively .
The probability of survival in the irinotecan group was 82.1% at 9 months and 69.1% at 12 months ,  and in the noirinotecan group was 71.6% and 59.1% ,  respectively .
The interaction between treatment and regimen was not significant .
There was insufficient power to compare the efficacy risk of progression for a patient in the no-irinotecan group was increased by about 69% compared with that for a patient in the irinotecan group when all other variables were equal .
The median time to treatment failure was 5.3 (0.4-15.7+) months in the irinotecan group and 3.8 (0.4-11.5+) months in the no-irinotecan group (p=0.0014) .
The time to definitive deterioration in performance status was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group (median 11.2 [0.1+.15.7+]) vs 9.9 [0+.13¡¤6+] months ,  p=0.046; figure 4 ) .
In the irinotecan group ,  diarrhoea and neutropenia were the most common toxic effects in each regimen ,  and were significantly more frequent and severe than in the noirinotecan group .
With the 2-weekly regimen ,  diarrhoea was more frequent in the irinotecan group than in the noirinotecan group ,  and the difference was close to siginificance in the weekly regimen .
For the 2-weekly regimen ,  16 (11.0%) patients in the irinotecan group and two (1.4%) in the no-irinotecan group were admitted for diarrhoea .
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and leukopenia were significantly more frequent in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group ,  irrespective of regimen .
In the irinotecan group ,  admission was required for fever in the absence of infection with concomitant grade 3 or 4 neutropenia for five (9.3%) patients on the weekly regimen and one (0.7%) on the 2-weekly regimen; for the no-irinotecan group ,  admission was required for one (2.3%) patient on the weekly regimen and none on the 2 weekly regimen .
Asthenia was the second most frequent nonhaematological toxic effect in the irinotecan group ,  and grade 3 or 4 asthenia was significantly more frequent in this group than in the no-irinotecan group for the 2-weekly regimen .
In the irinotecan group ,  about 25% of patients developed cholinergic syndromes that were rarely severe .
Overall ,  toxic effects seen with the irinotecan combination treatment were reversible ,  non-cumulative ,  and manageable .
