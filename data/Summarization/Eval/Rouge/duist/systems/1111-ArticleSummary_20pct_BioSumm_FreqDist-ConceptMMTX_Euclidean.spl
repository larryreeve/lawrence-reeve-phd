INTRODUCTION .
Traditionally ,  women with lymph node metastases have been treated with postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy .
Study Design .
Eligibility .
Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to entry on study fulfilling all institutional ,  state ,  and federal regulations .
The ureter had to be unroofed from its entry into the broad ligament to its intramural portion in the bladder and dissected laterally from its attachments to the cardinal ligament .
Quality Control .
Any disagreement among the reviewing pathologists was resolved by a GOG referee pathologist .
Review of operative reports was conducted to evaluate the completeness of surgical procedures .
Between March 1988 and September 1995 ,  299 women were accessioned into the study .
Of the remaining 277 eligible patients ,  137 were randomly assigned to radiotherapy and 140 to no further treatment .
The tumor cell type was squamous in 218 (79%) women ,  adenosquamous in 32 (12%) ,  and adenocarcinoma in 27 (10%) .
There was a disproportionately larger number of patients with positive CLS among the NFT regimen (24% versus 35%) and more patients with .4 cm diameter tumors in the RT regimen (62% versus 54%) .
By contrast ,  there were only 21 (15.3%) cancer recurrences ,  18 (13.1%) local and 3 (2.2%) distant among the 137 patients treated with postoperative radiation .
The site of recurrence was unknown for 2 patients .
Eighty-six percent of patients have either died or have been followed at least 3 years .
There is a small but noteworthy imbalance in the follow-up between the two treatment regimens .
DISCUSSION .
The invasion of lymphvascular spaces by tumor has been found to be an unfavorable prognostic factor by many investigators but its significance was denied by others .
Of the three risk factors ,  depth of invasion seems the most objective and accurate method—a direct measurement on the histological slide .
Furthermore ,  repeat measurements from thesame slide can be taken by the reviewers for the quality control procedures .
Nevertheless ,  the use of this formula by the participating institutions has been successful in achieving a high acceptance rate with only 22 patients (7%) found ineligible for the study .
However ,  the combination of factors proved more accurate than any of the factors alone .
More recently ,  Thomas and Dembo postulated that women with negative nodes but primary tumor-related poor prognostic factors were more likely to recur in the pelvis than in distant sites and ,  therefore ,  may benefit from pelvic irradiation .
By contrast ,  in women with positive nodes local failure is more frequently associated with metastases in distant sites that are not affected by pelvic irradiation .
However ,  no such evidence from randomized trials is available about effective treatment of positive lymph nodes .
A significant number of women with Stage IB cervical cancer should benefit from adjuvant pelvic irradiation because 25% of the lymph-node negative patients have high risk factors according to the 1990 GOG data .
Moreover ,  Thomas and Dembo have demonstrated that ,  in absolute terms ,  an equal number of deaths occur among the estimated 85% of Stage IB cervical cancer patients with negative nodes as among the 15% with positive nodes .
Three of 5 women with major adverse effects recovered either spontaneously or after appropriate treatment .
The rate of postradiation complications in our study was similar to those reported in the literature .
