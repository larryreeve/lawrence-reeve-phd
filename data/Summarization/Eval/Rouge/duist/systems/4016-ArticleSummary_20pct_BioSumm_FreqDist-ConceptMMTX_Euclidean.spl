Introduction .
An additional 40% of patients experienced tumour stabilisation for a median of 5 months .
Patients' selection .
Guidelines were provided for the management of side-effects (panel) .
They were classified  with the WHO dictionary ,  further subclassification was done  with the WHO code for anatomical therapeutic class (ATC) .
Beyond 1 year ,  only date of death  was traced .
Statistical analysis .
The patients' characteristics are shown in table 1 .
Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival are presented in figure 2 .
There were 123 (65%) events in the irinotecan  group ,  median duration of which was 9.2 (range 0-18.9)  months .
In the supportive-care group there were 71 (79%) events ,  the median duration of which was  6.5 (range 0.7-19.3) months .
In this group the survival probability at 6 months was 54.1% ,  at 9 months 29.1% ,  and at 12 months 13.8% .
Median follow-up was 12.9 months .
With a performance status of less than two there were 98 (60%) events in the irinotecan group ,  median duration  of which was 10.5 (range 0.18-9) months .
In the  supportive-care-alone group there were 53 (77%) events ,   median duration 7.4 (0.7-19.3) months .
In this group  the survival probability at 6 months was 62.5% ,  at  9 months 33.2% ,  and at 12 months 16.2% .
With a performance status of two there were 24 (92%) events in  the irinotecan group ,  median duration of which was 5.1  (range 0.3-18.5) months .
In the supportive-care group there were 18 (86%) events ,  the median duration of  which was 3.5 (range 1.1-11.0) months .
In this group  the survival probability at 6 months was 26.5% ,  at 9 months 15.9% ,  and at 12 months 7.9% .
There  were 61 (73%) events in the irinotecan group ,  median  duration of which was 6.9 (range 0.3-17.2) months .
In  the supportive-care group there were 26 (79%) events ,   median duration 2.0 (0.13.0) months .
In this group the survival probability at 6 months was 31.5% ,  at 9 months  14.7% ,  and at 12 months 4.9% .
Within 23 weeks of randomisation ,  the rate of patients with opioid  consumption by 3-week blocks ranged from 25% to 34% in the irinotecan group and from 40% to 56% in the  supportive-care group .
On difference from baseline multivariate  analysis of variance was significant (p=0.0001) .
Discussion .
This study showed that treatment with irinotecan and supportive care alone ,  compared with supportive care ,  prolonged the life of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer .
The study also showed an advantage for irinotecan for quality of life .
