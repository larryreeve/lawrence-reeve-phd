Stage I cervical cancer has a relatively favorable prognosis with an 80% cure rate achieved with radical hysterectomy or radiotherapy .
However ,  the 20% mortality after surgery has remained virtually unchanged during the past three decades .
Additional risk factors for recurrence ,  e.g. ,  large tumor diameter (LTD) ,  deep stromal invasion (DSI) ,  and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces (CLS) found on microscopic examination have been only recently recognized and less extensively investigated than lymph node metastases .
However ,  sufficient data have been reported in the literature to categorize LTD ,  DSI ,  and CLS as independent risk factors because of their frequent association with increased cancer recurrence and mortality .
In 1988 the GOG initiated a prospective randomized study (GOG #92) ,  reported here ,  to investigate the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy for Stage I cervical cancer patients treated by conventional radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who were at high risk for recurrence ,  because of LTD ,  DSI ,  CLS ,  but excluding patients with lymph node metastases .
The GOG #92 multicenter prospective randomized study was designed to determine whether postoperative pelvic radiotherapy following radical hysterectomy and pelvic node dissection would reduce the rate of recurrence and decrease the mortality in Stage IB cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter ,  deep stromal invasion by tumor ,  and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces found on microscopic examination .
The study’s target sample size was set at 169 eligible patients based on a desire to detect a 55% decrease in recurrence rate (exponential model with l 5 0.01 recurrences/month) with the use of radiation therapy .
In 1993 ,  the sample size goal was increased because of the lower than expected recurrence rate ,  a better estimate of the change in the recurrence rate over time ,  and a small ,  but significant ,  frequency of noncompliance in the radiation therapy (RT) regimen .
The revised sample size goal was 260 patients and the final analysis of recurrence-free interval would occur once 60 recurrences were observed .
The pelvic irradiation was given with a fourfield technique with a megavoltage beam ,  although cobalt-60 was allowed if the SSD was greater than 80 cm. Radiation dose was from 46 Gy in 23 fractions to 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions ,  5 fractions per week .
The Radiotherapy Committee examined therapy forms ,  diagrams of irradiated fields ,  dosimetry curves ,  and portal fields for each external field .
Statistical Methods .
The difference in RFI and survival by treatment regimen was evaluated using the log-rank test applying the intent-to-treat principle .
Imbalances between patient and disease characteristics and treatment regimens was accomplished using the Pearson’s x2 test .
There were 128 (46%) patients with the risk factors of positive CLS and deep one-third stromal invasion ,  65 (23%) had positive CLS ,  middle third stromal invasion and tumor size $2 cm ,  82 (30%) had negative CLS ,  middle or deep third stromal invasion and a $4-cm tumor ,  and 2 (0.7%) had positive CLS ,  superficial stromal invasion ,  and tumor size $5 cm (Table 3) .
There was a disproportionately larger number of patients with positive CLS among the NFT regimen (24% versus 35%) and more patients with .4 cm diameter tumors in the RT regimen (62% versus 54%) .
However ,  the overall risk for recurrence was very similar in each regimen when all three risk factors were considered as a group (See Cox Model analyses) .
Of the 137 patients randomized to radiotherapy ,  9 (6.6%) refused all radiotherapy and 6 (4.4%) refused to continue therapy after receiving less than 85% of the prescribed dose of 50.4 Gy (3.6 ,  3.6 ,  10.4 ,  14.4 ,  16.2 ,  and 36.0 Gy) .
One patient discontinued radiotherapy due to an adverse reaction after receiving 21.6 Gy .
The relative mortality rate is estimated at 0.64 which indicates 36% less mortality in the radiation group ,  a significance level is not provided because the survival data are not mature .
In an attempt to evaluate the impact of this imbalance ,  the log–rank test was recalculated assuming the first five patients lost (the excess number) in the RT group recurred at the time of their last clinical evaluation .
Nine (7.0%) of the 128 patients who received radiotherapy had 11 episodes of grade 3 (severe) or 4 (life-threatening) adverse effects compared to 3 (2.1%) from the NFT group .
Nevertheless ,  we found tumor diameter to be the most significant risk factors in the Cox model analysis of our study results ,  confirming multiple data sets which demonstrate that the size of the primary cancer is critical for local control despite the imprecision of measurement .
The formula combining the three risk factors that we used to determine patient eligibility may appear complicated .
We reanalyzed our results using the Cox model trying to simplify the formula or to use only a single risk factor as a predictor .
The present prospective randomized study showed that adjunctive radiotherapy significantly reduced the number of cancer recurrences in women with the above risk factors by 44% and that the difference in recurrences between irradiated and nonirradiated patients was statistically significant at the P 5 0.019 level .
However ,  caution must be observed due to the disproportionately higher number of patients that are “lost to followup” among those receiving radiation therapy and the need for further follow-up to determine what impact radiation therapy has on survival .
The GOG attempted to conduct a randomized radiotherapy trial for women with positive nodes ,  but could not complete the study because of failure to enroll a sufficient number of patients (unpublished GOG data) .
Since the node-negative group accounts for one-half of all Stage IB cervical cancer deaths adjuvant radiotherapy for women with risk factors should substantially reduce the overall Stage IB mortality .
Increased morbidity in patients receiving full course radiotherapy following radical surgery for cervical cancer has been reported .
