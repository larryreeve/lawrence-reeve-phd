The present study was designed with restricted selection criteria and high dose-intensities of the two most active chemotherapeutic agents .
Results .
The first generation of randomized adjuvant trials have recently been reviewed and a meta-analysis performed on the basis of updated patient records .
A second generation of randomized ,  control-based ,  adjuvant trials started in the early 1990s .
The time of the analysis (November ,  1999) was 36 months after the last randomization .
Study Design and Staging .
Treatment started after the completion of any local treatment and/or as soon as the wound had healed (Fig 1) .
Selection Criteria .
Adjuvant Treatment .
RESULTS .
In November ,  1996 ,  the per protocol interim analysis of disease-free survival revealed a significant difference in favor of chemotherapy (P = .001) ,  therefore the accrual was stopped and the data reported .
The present article deals with a minimum observation time of 36 months calculated from the date of randomization of the last patient (11 of 96) .
Twenty-four percent of the cycles were delayed for toxicity or for nonmedical reasons ,  in the majority of these cases (16%) ,  the delay was shorter than 1 week and can be attributed to logistic problems rather than to toxicity .
The first cycle was administered at a dose less than or equal to 50% in one patient and less than or equal to 75% in another six patients based on nonprotocol medical decisions .
There was a subsequent slight and constant decrease in the administered doses of mainly EPI ,  which was in accordance with the predefined reduction scheme and testifies to the aggressiveness of the program .
The mean administered doses of the fifth cycle (94 mg of EPI and 8,156 mg of IFO) were slightly lower than those of the fourth cycle (95.5 mg of EPI and 8,257 mg of IFO) .
However ,  the duration of leukopenia never exceeded 4 days ,  and all of the patients were rapidly discharged .
Prophylactic oral antibiotics were given in an additional eight cases .
Follow-Up Data .
Sixty first events (local ,  distant only ,  and synchronous distant and local) were observed overall (32 in the control arm and 28 in the treatment arm) .
In four patients ,  the first event was a synchronous local relapse with metastases (one patient in the control arm and three patients in the treatment arm) .
Furthermore ,  nine patients developed metachronous relapse at a different site (three were local relapse after a metastasis and six were distant relapses after a previous local relapse) .
Additional relapses at the same site after an adequate treatment are not reported .
Local DFS .
Overall ,  the difference in distant relapses as the first event between the two arms was not significant (P = .48 ,  Fig 3) .
One patient in the control group died without evidence of disease at 28 months and was considered as censored for overall survival .
Adjuvant treatment of localized soft tissue sarcomas is controversial because no sufficient and convincing data are available .
Furthermore ,  a number of other points about the first-generation studies evaluated by the meta-analysis should be discussed .
The early 1990s saw the activation of a number of second-generation protocols throughout the world ,  which ,  although they were planned independently ,  were extraordinarily similar in terms of their selection criteria ,  chemotherapeutic regimens ,  and use of growth factors .
The regimen used in the present study represents the highest dose-intensity ever tried in an adjuvant setting for soft tissue sarcomas .
However ,  only high-risk patients were selected for this study .
Furthermore ,  the Rizzoli Institute had already published a positive adjuvant trial17,18 and the risk of undertreating a great number of patients was a concern .
The outcome results at 4 years revealed a 23% overall local relapse ,  with a trend in favor of the treatment group .
This unfavorable local behaviour is mainly because of the dimension of local disease ,  in our opinion .
However ,  between the three different local approaches there was a trend in favor of preoperative radiation therapy (two local relapse of 24 patients in the control arm ,  8.3%) .
Moreover ,  this treatment option5,32,33 was chosen for those patients presenting with locally far-advanced disease or with disease approaching critical structures (nerves and vessels) ,  therefore a high incidence of local relapse could be foreseen .
Additionally ,  the difference between the treated and untreated groups is further evidence of the positive impact of chemotherapy on local control ,  as already reported by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer adjuvant trial .
Time is a crucial issue in oncology and in the development of metastatic disease from high-risk soft tissue sarcomas .
The present trial deals with data obtained at a median follow-up time of 59 months and 36 months after last randomization .
