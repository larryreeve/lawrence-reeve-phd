THE American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics define stage IB cervical cancer as invasive cancer that is confined to the cervix ,  with a depth of more than 5 mm and a width of more than 7 mm. In patients with large stage IB cervical cancers ,  local control and survival are poorer than in patients with smaller stage I cancers ,  whether treated by surgery or irradiation .
Extraperitoneal surgical staging of lymph nodes was optional .
Patients with histologic evidence of lymph-node involvementwere not eligible ,  nor were those who had previously received radiotherapy or chemotherapy or those with a history of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer .
Fractions of 1.8 to 2.0 Gy were delivered 5 days a week over a period of 4 1/2 to 5 weeks ,  for a total dose of 45 Gy .
Chemotherapy .
Cisplatin was given intravenously once a week at a dose of 40 mg per square meter of body-surface area ,  with the total dose not to exceed 70 mg per week .
The final dose could be given during a patient’s hospitalization for intracavitary brachytherapy .
Quality Control and Follow-up .
Patients’ medical records ,  films ,  and pathology slides were reviewed by the appropriate Gynecologic Oncology Group committees .
The difference between groups in survival and progression-free survival was evaluated with use of the logrank test according to the intention-to-treat principle .
Differences between groups in the severity of adverse effects and the frequency of hysterectomy specimens that were negative for cancer were evaluated with use of Pearson’s chi-square test .
To simplify presentation ,  the P values were not adjusted for the results of the two interim analyses .
RESULTS .
One patient assigned to receive radiotherapy alone and two patients assigned to receive radiotherapyand cisplatin refused to undergo radiotherapy .
Grade 3 hematologic toxicity was defined as a total white-cell count of less than 2000 per cubic millimeter ,  and grade 4 as a total white-cell count of less than 1000 per cubic millimeter .
The frequency of grade 1 (minimal) and grade 2 (mild) genitourinary and neurologic adverse effects was higher in the combined-therapy group .
Progression-free Survival .
The disease recurred in 69 patients in the group given radiotherapy alone (37 percent) and 38 patients given radiotherapy and cisplatin (21 percent) (Table 4) .
This difference predominantly reflects the fact that there were fewer local recurrences in the combined-therapy group (16 ,  vs. 39 in the radiotherapy group) .
The median duration of follow-up was 36 months .
The use of extrafascial hysterectomy after radiotherapy has gradually been abandoned ,  but there has continued to be disagreement about the value of the operation .
Like others ,  we found that the size of the tumor was an important prognostic factor .
Cisplatin potentiates the sublethal damageinduced by radiation and inhibits the repair of potentially lethal radiation-induced damage .
The promising results of these studies as well as the fact that this combination is well tolerated and easy to administer on an outpatient basis led us to evaluate it in this trial .
In that study ,  the combination of concurrent radiotherapy and cisplatin-containing chemotherapy was superior to treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy .
In our trial the only difference in the protocols for the two groups was the use of weekly infusions of cisplatin during radiotherapy for bulky stage IB cervical cancers .
It is reasonable to conclude on the basis of these results and our results that the elimination of hysterectomy from both regimens would not have affected the increase in survival associated with the use of cisplatin .
The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment ,  but they share a common result ,  all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin .
