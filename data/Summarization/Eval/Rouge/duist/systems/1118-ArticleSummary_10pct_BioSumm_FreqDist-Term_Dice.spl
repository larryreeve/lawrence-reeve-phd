While no therapy has been proven more effective than radical external-beam plus intracavitary radiotherapy ,  considerable research effort ,  including addition of chemotherapy plus radiation ,  is currently being put into improving survival rate in patients with advanced carcinoma of the cervix .
The rationale for adding chemotherapy to pelvic radiation is to provide systemic cytotoxic agents active against cervical cancer with the potential to enhance the radiosensitivity ,  to enhance local tumor control ,  and to eradicate micrometastasis .
The concurrent use of radiation and chemotherapy ,  either as a single agent or in combination ,  has also been demonstrated to be effective in the local control of advanced carcinoma of the cervix with acceptable toxicity as presented by several reports ,  and was also supported by our previous phase I and II trial .
Other eligibility criteria consisted of a pathologically verified squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix ,  a Karnofsky performance status index of 80% or above ,  and an age of younger than 70 years .
Pretreatment evaluation included a complete medical history and physical examination ,  complete blood count ,  serum electrolytes ,  chemistry profile ,  tumor markers ,  chest X ray ,  an electrocardiogram ,  and contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis .
In the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group ,  chemotherapeutic regimens consisted of cisplatin (50 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously at the rate of 1 mg/min on Day 1) ,  vincristine (1 mg/m2 intravenously push on Day 2) ,  and bleomycin (25 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously infusion in divided doses on Days 2 ,  3 ,  and 4) which were given starting on Day 1 of radiotherapy and then every 3 weeks for a total of four courses .
The acute treatment-related toxicity (grade 3 or 4) appears to be higher with the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group when compared with radiation group (36.7% versus 17.7% ,  P Å 0.02) .
Although there was no significant difference between the two compared groups with regard to treatment-related late toxicity (concurrent group 23.3% versus radiation group 12.9% ,  P = 0.13) , a nonsignificant trend toward a higher rate of late toxicity in the chemoradiotherapy group is evident .
Of the 9 patients requiring treatment delays ,  7 patients (77.8%) died of disease (5) or are alive with disease (2) ,  whereas 18 of the 49 patients (36.7%) who had completed their planned treatment without treatment delays died of disease or are alive with disease .
After a median follow-up of 46.8 months ,  the disease-free survival and actuarial survival rates at 3 years for patients in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group were not statistically different compared with patients in the radiotherapy group (51.7% versus 53.2% ,  P Å 0.92 ,  and 61.7% versus 64.5% ,  P Å 0.88 ,  respectively) .
Analysis by Kaplan ­ Meier method showed that the actuarial survival was not statistically different between the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups (mean survival time ,  38.1 months versus 41.5 months ,  P Å 0.27) .
The published trials in advanced cervical carcinoma with concurrent chemoradiotherapy ,  either a single-agent weekly cisplatin or in combination with cisplatin ­ 5-FU or cisplatin ­ bleomycin ­ vincristine ,  yield tumor response rates of approximately 80% ,  and 3-year survival rates reached 50 to 60% of patients .
Therefore ,  to test the hypothesis of concurrent chemoradiotherapy improving the survival rate of advanced cervical cancer ,  in 1990 we began a phase III randomized trial comparing concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus pelvic radiation alone in patients with advanced cervical carcinoma at our institution .
To further increase the systemic activity and the radiation-enhancing potential of the chemotherapy ,  we chose cisplatin-based regimens with vincristine and bleomycin in this trial because it had proven high efficacy of local control in our previous phase I and II trials for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
Although the response rate of 88.4% ,  following concurrent chemoradiotherapy ,  in our study is very encouraging when compared with 74.3% of the radiotherapy group at the end of therapy ,  this study does not provide evidence that chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone with respect to survival .
Our results indicated that ,  despite the excellent early tumor response seen during treatment ,  the benefit of concurrent chemoradiation in terms of reduced mortality and increased pelvic control rates may not be as great as that suggested by other reports .
