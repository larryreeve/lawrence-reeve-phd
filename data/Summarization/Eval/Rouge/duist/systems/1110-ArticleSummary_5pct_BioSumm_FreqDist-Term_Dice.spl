We enrolled women of all ages who had stages IIB through IVA squamous-cell carcinoma ,  adenocarcinoma ,  or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix according to the staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (Table 1) or stage IB or IIA of one of these cancers with a tumor diameter of at least 5 cm or biopsy-proved metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes .
Women were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria ,  disease outside the pelvic area or spread to para-aortic lymph nodes ,  a prior cancer other than cutaneous basal-cell carcinoma ,  medical contraindications to chemotherapy ,  a rare histologic subtype ,  and prior hysterectomy or transperitoneal staging procedure for cervical cancer ,  pelvic radiotherapy ,  or systemic chemotherapy .
Custom shielding was designed to treat the pelvic lymph nodes ,  with a margin of at least 1 to 1.5 cm. For patients who were assigned to receive radiotherapy alone ,  the pelvic and paraaortic areas were treated as a continuous area ,  with a superiorfield border at the space between L1 and L2 .
Within 16 hours after the first radiation fraction was administered ,  patients in the combination-therapy group received the first cycle of chemotherapy ,  which consisted of an intravenous infusion of 75 mg of cisplatin per square meter of body-surface area over a 4-hour period followed by an intravenous infusion of 4000 mg of fluorouracil per square meter over a 96-hour period .
Disease- free survival was also compared in the two groups and was calculated from the date of study entry to the date of the first occurrence of disease progression ,  a second diagnosis of cancer ,  or death from any cause ,  or if none of these events occurred ,  to the date of the last follow-up visit .
Fifteen patients (4 percent) — six in the combined-therapy group and nine in the radiotherapy group — were subsequently disqualified because of failure to undergo the required evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (eight patients) ,  the presence of extrapelvic cancer (two) ,  the presence of a rare histologic subtype (one) ,  the presence of a stage IB1 tumor with no involvement of pelvic nodes (one) ,  the absence of pretreatment data (two) ,  and receipt of chemotherapy before radiotherapy (one) .
Although moderate (grade 3) and severe (grade 4) side effects occurred more frequently during or within 60 days after the completion of treatment with combined therapy than with radiotherapy alone ,  these effects were usually self-limited or resolved with medical management (Table 3) .
Despite these criticisms ,  the resultsof that study and those of trials assessing concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy for other tumors stimulated studies of the effects of radiotherapy and various combinations of fluorouracil ,  cisplatin ,  mitomycin ,  carboplatin ,  and paclitaxel as treatments for locally advanced cervical cancer.The results of these trials have been encouraging ,  but mostclinicians have not found them sufficiently  convincing to justify the inclusion of chemotherapy in the routine treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer .
