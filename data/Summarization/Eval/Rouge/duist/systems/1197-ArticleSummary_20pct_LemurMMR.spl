adjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma is controversial because previous trials reported conflicting results 
the main finding of the intention to treat analysis in this study is the beneficial impact of chemotherapy on the dfs p 04 and os p 03 for patients affected by high risk extremity soft tissue sarcomas and treated with chemotherapy 
adjuvant treatment of localized soft tissue sarcomas is controversial because no sufficient and convincing data are available 
additionally the difference between the treated and untreated groups is further evidence of the positive impact of chemotherapy on local control as already reported by the european organization for research and treatment of cancer adjuvant trial 
adjuvant treatment of soft tissue sarcomas is still strongly debated35 36 despite 14 published trials and one meta analysis performed on 1 568 randomized patients 
the preliminary data of previous studies were sometimes positive for dfs and os 15 19 but further analyses made after an adequate follow up time indicated a disappearance of the positive effect of chemotherapy on 20 21 and in some cases worse results 22 however the recently published meta analysis 7 involving 1 568 patients showed a statistically significant benefit for treated patients of 6 10 and 10 for local metastatic and overall dfs respectively and a favorable but not statistically significant trend in os 4 after a median of 9 4 years of follow up 
intensified adjuvant chemotherapy had a positive impact on the dfs and os of patients with high risk extremity soft tissue sarcomas at a median follow up of 59 months 
it is directly derived from consecutive phase i ii dose intensification trials carried out at the centro di riferimento oncologico of aviano 27 31 the epirubicin dose level of 60 mg m2 x 2 days represents the step before the maximum tolerated dose established in those trials 70 mg m2 epirubicin x 2 days when given in combination with fixed full doses of ifosfamide 1 8 g m2 d x 5 days in advanced cases of soft tissue sarcoma 
the regimen used in the present study represents the highest dose intensity ever tried in an adjuvant setting for soft tissue sarcomas 
furthermore the univariate analysis performed at interim analysis and repeated yearly thereafter for all characteristics reported in table 1 did not reveal any statistically significant differences between the two patient groups except for chemotherapy 
the benefit is seen despite the fact that four of the seven patients that never started chemotherapy for different reasons died from uncontrolled metastatic disease 
we chose dfs as the end point because os is not a realistic end point for an interim analysis in a rare disease and in the adjuvant setting 
nevertheless a great proportion of high risk soft tissue sarcoma patients develop distant metastases during their lives 
preoperative radiation therapy 44 8 gy in 28 fractions in 2 5 weeks 160 cgy fraction 2 fractions per day followed by resection with or without a post or intraoperative boost 16 to 18 gy for positive or close surgical margins was used for tumors extending to critical structures for which conservative surgical resection was expected to be inadequate and amputation would usually have to be performed to obtain negative margins 
time is a crucial issue in oncology and in the development of metastatic disease from high risk soft tissue sarcomas 
in fact disease stages tumor sizes and grading varied greatly 23 second eight studies made use of a polychemotherapy including an anthracycline vincristine cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine but only the first is active in soft tissue sarcomas the others probably increased toxicity 
inclusion criteria were as follows age 18 to 65 years eastern cooperative oncology group ecog performance status less than or equal to 2 primary tumors subfascially localized with diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm high grade spindle cell or polymorphous sarcomas fibrosarcoma malignant fibrous histiocytoma polymorphous liposarcoma leiomyosarcoma synovial sarcoma malignant schwannoma angiosarcoma and polymorphous rhabdomyosarcoma local relapse of any size no previous radio chemotherapy adequate bone marrow wbc count of 4 000 fil platelets 120 000 ml and hemoglobin 10 g dl renal creatinine 1 3 mg dl hepatic sgot 2 5 x normal value and bilirubin 1 2 mg dl and pulmonary functions 
the median disease free survival dfs was 48 months in the treatment group and 16 months in the control group p 04 and the median overall survival os was 75 months for treated and 46 months for untreated patients p 03 
for os the absolute benefit deriving from chemotherapy was 13 at 2 years and increased to 19 at 4 years p 04 
the estimated cumulative incidence function at 2 years was 28 for the control arm and 45 for the treatment arm p 08 at 4 years it was 44 and 45 respectively p 94 
the distribution between the different local treatment modalities radical surgery surgery and postoperative radiation therapy and preoperative radiation therapy and surgery was respectively two of 16 patients seven of 20 and two of 15 for the control group and three of 20 patients six of 24 and zero of nine for the treatment group 
the main findings were statistical evidence in favor of chemotherapy for local metastasis and overall dfs p 016 0003 and 0001 respectively and a trend towards increased os p 12 
twenty four percent of the cycles were delayed for toxicity or for nonmedical reasons in the majority of these cases 16 the delay was shorter than 1 week and can be attributed to logistic problems rather than to toxicity 
these developments created new interest in the use of dose intensification for advanced disease27 31 and the planning of new trials of adjuvant treatment 
under the auspices of the italian national council for research cnr 104 patients 53 in the chemotherapy and 51 in the control arm entered the study between june 1992 and november 1996 
although these first generation trials are no longer the gold standards the meta analysis did reveal a number of elements that suggested a positive role of adjuvant chemotherapy 
soft tissue sarcomas represent less than 1 of all malignant tumors and derive from the mesenchymal tissues present in the whole human body 
in the early 1960s this clinical behaviour prompted the introduction of adjuvant chemotherapy trials with the aim of increasing dfs and possibly overall survival os 
although cure is still difficult to achieve a significant delay in death is worthwhile also considering the short duration of treatment and the absence of toxic deaths 
however the vast majorities arise from the extra osseous and subcutaneous soft tissue of the limbs 
however the median diameter is the same in the two groups and the difference in range is caused by a small number three patients of large tumors in the control group 
after a positive biopsy for sarcoma all patients underwent complete staging and programmed local treatment 
univariate analyses did not reveal any statistically significant difference in overall dfs and os for any of the characteristics considered age sex center of surgery histology grading site of primary tumor presentation diameter local treatment and stratification with the exception of adjuvant treatment data not shown 
purpose 
moreover this treatment option5 32 33 was chosen for those patients presenting with locally far advanced disease or with disease approaching critical structures nerves and vessels therefore a high incidence of local relapse could be foreseen 
this is not surprising because our patients were selected based on the worst prognostic factors 
however because our study was designed in 1991 and activated in june 1992 and included only 104 patients it is possible that an imbalance of other prognostic factors not included in table 1 could have led to the difference in outcome between the two groups 
therefore the observation time of a given study population could be misleading as reported for some of the first generation trials 20 21 
overall dfs was defined as the time between randomization and the first recurrence and os was defined as the time between randomization and death as a result of disease patients dying in complete remission were considered as censored on the date of death for os
