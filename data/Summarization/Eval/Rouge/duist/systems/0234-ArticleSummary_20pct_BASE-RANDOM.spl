Its use ,  however ,  is limited by cumulative ,  dose-dependent ,  chronic cardiotoxicity .
More recently ,  however ,  subclinical cardiac injury has been documented at considerably lower doses .
Discontinuation of therapy in these patients may prevent cardiac failure ,  but also results in curtailment of the antineoplastic effect of DOX .
One approach to solving this problem is the development of DOX analogues that retain antineoplastic activity but possess reduced potential for cardiac damage .
In two clinical phase I studies ,  EPI was found to have acceptable toxicity at doses of 85 to 90 mg/m2 given intravenously (IV) every three weeks .
We used multigated radionuclide cineangiocardiography (RNCA) to assess cardiac toxicity in this prospective ,  randomized study comparing the efficacy ,  acute ,  and chronic toxicities of EPI with DOX in patients with advanced breast cancer .
Patients whose prior treatment included an anthracycline were excluded from this study .
Treatment ProtocolEPI was supplied by Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Milan ,  Italy) in a powdered form that was reconstituted with sterile water for injection United States Pharmacopeia .
DOX was prepared in accordance with the package insert .
Both EPI and DOX were administered by slow (five minute) injections through an established IV line every three weeks .
Any patient who developed progressive disease within three months of starting therapy was considered to have progressed even if she had demonstrated transient tumor regression .
Patients' RBCs were labeled in vivo by injecting 10 to 20 mCi of technetium 99m IV 30 minutes after stannous pyrophosphate injection .
Imaging was obtained for three minutes at the point of maximal tolerable exercise .
RESULTSPatient CharacteristicsA total of 54 women were randomized ,  25 to the EPI arm and 29 to the DOX arm .
Although all patients had received prior chemotherapy which included cyclophosphamide or other alkylating agent ,  no patient had been previously treated with mitomycin C .
Doses were reduced more frequently on the DOX arm as compared to the EPI arm ,  in which two patients' doses were escalated .
The median actual dose administered was 100% of the projected dose of EPI and 86% of the planned dose of DOX (Wilcoxon test ,  P = .01) .
There were seven MRs on the DOX arm and seven patients with stable disease for at least three months .
Although the major response rates did not differ between the two arms (chisquare test ,  P = .98) ,  the difference in duration of response is of borderline significance (logrank test ,  P = .11) .
Of the 13 patients with PRs ,  six had tumors that were estrogen receptor positive ,  six had estrogen receptor negative tumors ,  and in one patient the estrogen receptor value was unknown .
Noncardiac ToxicityHematologic toxicity was similar in the two arms (Table 3) .
Other common toxicities included nausea ,  vomiting ,  and alopecia .
Of the 15 evaluable patients treated with EPI ,  six had received prior radiotherapy to the chest wall ,  internal mammary lymph nodes ,  sternum ,  or thoracic spine prior to entry on this study ,  and two had a history of well-controlled mild hypertension .
The median cumulative dose to laboratory cardiotoxicity in these patients was 892 mg/m2 of EPI and 360 mg/m 2 of DOX .
The difference is highly significant (log rank test ,  P < .0001) .
Overall ,  100% of the planned dose of EPI (85 mg/m2) was administered ,  however ,  only 86% (52 mg/m2) of the planned dose of DOX was given .
Nor did all patients experience a steady progressive decline in LVEF ,  most maintained a stable LVEF until there was an acute decrease .
Four patients treated with EPI and five patients treated with DOX developed clinical congestive heart failure (CHF) .
Survival analysis methods were also applied to compare the cumulative doses to clinical CHF for patients in the two arms .
DISCUSSIONIn this study ,  EPI had therapeutic activity in breast cancer similar to DOX ,  but produced less cardiotoxicity than the parent compound .
Long-term administration of DOX on a conventional every three week schedule is limited by the development of dose-related congestive cardiomyopathy .
Although the data are suggestive ,  it remains unproven that the antitumor activity of DOX is fully preserved when these schedules are used .
This suggests that EPI might have a better therapeutic index in patients with cancer .
A combination of RNCA and endomyocardial biopsy is recommended for the individual patient at high risk for whom a therapeutic decision must be made .
Potential selection factors that might bias the comparison of cardiac effects are thereby avoided .
The observed major therapeutic response rate to EPI (25%) was identical to that observed with DOX (25%) .
This is similar to the 27% response rate reported by the Early Clinical Trials Group of the EORTC (European Organization for the Research on Treatment of Cancer) .
It was also similar to the combined experience in the literature with DOX as a single agent in previously treated women with breast cancer .
Although these results could have been affected by the greater incidence of cardiac irradiation inpatients treated with DOX ,  only three patients who had received such radiotherapy actually developed CHF ,  one on the EPI arm and two on the DOX arm .
In the murine tumor model systems ,  equal doses of EPI and DOX produce equal therapeutic effects with less host toxicity in the EPI-treated mice ,  but a clinical assessment can only be based on studies in humans .
In the Milan study ,  the complete plus partial response rate to EPI was 5/11 and to DOX ,  7/15 ,  FEC produced a major response rate of 45% compared to a 43% response rate to FAC .
Since the present study did not use a fixed limitation for dose of EPI ,  patients who did not have progression of tumor were treated to the point of laboratory cardiotoxicity or clinical CHF ,  therefore ,  this study provides cumulative cardiotoxicity data that are not available in the other two studies .
