An analysis of data on 575 women enrolled in a previous Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) study of clinical and pathologic predictors of surgically treated stage carcinoma of the cervix confirmed the roles of LTD ,  DSI ,  and CLS as risk factors ,  increasing the probability of cancer recurrence at 3 years from 2 to 31% .
In 1988 the GOG initiated a prospective randomized study (GOG #92) ,  reported here ,  to investigate the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy for Stage I cervical cancer patients treated by conventional radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who were at high risk for recurrence ,  because of LTD ,  DSI ,  CLS ,  but excluding patients with lymph node metastases .
The GOG #92 multicenter prospective randomized study was designed to determine whether postoperative pelvic radiotherapy following radical hysterectomy and pelvic node dissection would reduce the rate of recurrence and decrease the mortality in Stage IB cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter ,  deep stromal invasion by tumor ,  and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces found on microscopic examination .
The study’s target sample size was set at 169 eligible patients based on a desire to detect a 55% decrease in recurrence rate (exponential model with l 5 0.01 recurrences/month) with the use of radiation therapy .
In 1993 ,  the sample size goal was increased because of the lower than expected recurrence rate ,  a better estimate of the change in the recurrence rate over time ,  and a small ,  but significant ,  frequency of noncompliance in the radiation therapy (RT) regimen .
Pelvic lymphadenectomy required bilateral removal of all nodal tissue and skeletonization of all vessels from the mid portion of the psoas muscle to uterer medially including the hypogastric artery and vein and from the obturator fossa anterior to the obturator nerve .
Other eligibility criteria for enrollment into the study included normal blood counts ,  normal liver and kidney function ,  absence of genitourinary tract abnormality as determined by intravenous pyelogram ,  renal sonogram ,  or computerized tomography ,  and absence of intercurrent diseases or other conditions that might not permit completion of the study or the required follow-up .
The pelvic irradiation was given with a fourfield technique with a megavoltage beam ,  although cobalt-60 was allowed if the SSD was greater than 80 cm. Radiation dose was from 46 Gy in 23 fractions to 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions ,  5 fractions per week .
All histology slides were reviewed by two pathologists of the GOG Pathology Committee who measured the depth of stromal invasion expressed in thirds of cervical thickness and ascertained the presence or absence of the capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement and the tumor cell type .
RFI was defined as the time from study entry to physical or radiographic evidence of disease recurrence ,  or date the patient was last seen .
There were 128 (46%) patients with the risk factors of positive CLS and deep one-third stromal invasion ,  65 (23%) had positive CLS ,  middle third stromal invasion and tumor size $2 cm ,  82 (30%) had negative CLS ,  middle or deep third stromal invasion and a $4-cm tumor ,  and 2 (0.7%) had positive CLS ,  superficial stromal invasion ,  and tumor size $5 cm (Table 3) .
Of the 137 patients randomized to radiotherapy ,  9 (6.6%) refused all radiotherapy and 6 (4.4%) refused to continue therapy after receiving less than 85% of the prescribed dose of 50.4 Gy (3.6 ,  3.6 ,  10.4 ,  14.4 ,  16.2 ,  and 36.0 Gy) .
The crude estimate in the reduction in risk in patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy was 47% (i.e. ,  relative risk 5 0.53) with the recurrence-free rate of 88% in the radiotherapy group and 79% in the no-further-therapy group at 2 years (Fig. 1) .
The Cox model analysis indicated that when adjusting for all combinations of the three risk factors—tumor size ,  CLS ,  and the depth of invasion—the risk of recurrence was significantly reduced by 44% in the radiation group (P 5 0.019 ,  one-tail) .
Thirty (21%) patients among those in the NFT group died ,  25 (18%) from cancer ,  compared to 18 (13%) deaths in the RT group ,  15 (11%) of whom died from cancer with one attributable to treatment (Table 5) .
The relative mortality rate is estimated at 0.64 which indicates 36% less mortality in the radiation group ,  a significance level is not provided because the survival data are not mature .
In an attempt to evaluate the impact of this imbalance ,  the log–rank test was recalculated assuming the first five patients lost (the excess number) in the RT group recurred at the time of their last clinical evaluation .
Other serious adverse effects regressed either spontaneously (transient paraplegia in one patient) ,  or after treatment (percutaneous nephrostomies for bilateral ureteral obstruction and transfusion of packed cells for severe anemia with a drop of hematocrit to 20%) .
Chung et al. reported that cervical cancer larger than 4 cm in diameter determined by preoperative palpation was associated with a 5-fold increase in pelvic lymph node metastases ,  a 10-fold increase in recurrences ,  and a 50% decrease in survival .
The present prospective randomized study showed that adjunctive radiotherapy significantly reduced the number of cancer recurrences in women with the above risk factors by 44% and that the difference in recurrences between irradiated and nonirradiated patients was statistically significant at the P 5 0.019 level .
However ,  addition of vault brachytherapy is unlikely to improve the results since there were only two isolated vault failures .
One report showed that postoperative radiation “prevented local recurrences and improved ten year tumor-free-survival” in a small number of women with CLS ,  DSI ,  and microscopically involved lymph nodes .
More recently ,  Thomas and Dembo postulated that women with negative nodes but primary tumor-related poor prognostic factors were more likely to recur in the pelvis than in distant sites and ,  therefore ,  may benefit from pelvic irradiation .
