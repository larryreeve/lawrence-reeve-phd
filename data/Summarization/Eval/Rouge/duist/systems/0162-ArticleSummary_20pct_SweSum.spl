SINCE JUNE 1973 ,  the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of CMF (cyclophosphamide ,  methotrexate ,  and fluorouracil) chemotherapy were evaluated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes .
After radical mastectomy ,  eligible patients were prospectively randomized to receive either no further treatment or 12 monthly cycles of adjuvant CMF .
All our progress reports have consistently demonstrated that there was a significant difference in the relapse-free survival (RFS) favoring patients who received adjuvant CMF .
In fact ,  a relative shortterm adjuvant systemic treatment would spare the patients a considerable amount of toxicity .
Similar findings were reported in the 4-yr analysis for the total patient population .
Before being allocated to either treatment group ,  patients were stratified according to the number of axillary nodes involved (1-3 or more than 3) .
Based on the 3-yr analysis of our first CMF study showing an apparent lack of therapeutic advantage following adjuvant chemotherapy in postmenopausal women ,  randomization for this group of patients was discontinued at the end of November 1976. Therefore ,  all postmenopausal patients were allocated to receive 12 CMF cycles between December 1976 and March 1977 when accrual for postmenopausal patients was definitely discontinued .
No postoperative radiotherapy or any other ancillary treatment was given .
Adjuvant chemotherapy was started within 2-4 wk from mastectomy .
During treatment ,  a dose reduction schedule was applied to all patients showing myelosuppression on days 1 and 8 of each treatment cycle .
The following systemic treatment was mainly utilized: patients in whom estrogen receptors were positive were subjected to hormonal manipulations (ovariectomy in premenopausal women and additive hormonal therapy ,  particularly tamoxifen ,  in postmenopausal patients) ,  combined sometimes with chemotherapy .
Whenever possible ,  patients who refused second-line cytotoxic chemotherapy were treated utilizing hormonal manipulations according to their age .
Patient Population Of 466 patients entered into the study ,  7 premenopausal women were considered nonevaluable because of protocol violations .
Therefore ,  a total of 459 patients were found evaluable for treatment comparison ,  i.e. ,  243 women (premenopausal 160 ,  postmenopausal 83) allocated in the 12-cycle group and 216 (premenopausal 164 ,  postmenopausal 52) in the 6-cycle group ,  respectively .
Furthermore ,  in 5 additional patients ,  CMF was temporarily discontinued at some time during treatment (for 2-3 mo) because women complained of constant nausea due to oral cyclophosphamide .
All these patients were considered evaluable .
It appears evident that treatment regimens were unable to significantly affect the RFS within each patient subset .
Again ,  no difference was observed in the two treatment groups .
In fact ,  premenopausal patients in the 12-cycle group had a 72% 5-yr survival compared to 77.1% for women in the 6-cycle group (p = 0.20) .
Site of First Relapse No difference in the pattern of treatment failure was evident between the treatment groups (Table 2) .
As can be seen ,  RFS was superior in patients with ER + tumors ,  but this difference failed to reach statistical significance in all patient subsets .
4 A similar type of analysis was performed on patients entered into this study .
Furthermore ,  within each dose level ,  there was no statistically significant difference between patients in the 12- or 6-cycle group .
Frequency of second tumors was similar in both treatment groups .
As already reported (Table 2) ,  contralateral breast cancer was documented in a total of 11 patients (CMF 12: 6; CMF 6: 5) .
Four additional patients showed second tumors other than breast cancer .
In one patient of the 6-cycle group ,  endometrial carcinoma in situ was documented within 16 mo from mastectomy; 3 patients in the 12-cycle group developed endometrial carcinoma ,  thyroid cancer ,  and myoblastoma ,  respectively ,  and in all patients second neoplasms were diagnosed between 46 and 49 mo from mastectomy .
So far no patient has developed acute leukemia .
The observation that in some patient subsets 6 cycles of CMF yielded apparently superior results to 12 cycles is probably related to the relative number of patients in each group and to the different median follow-up in postmenopausal women whose accrual was discontinued in December 1976. The findings supporting evidence of a therapeutic efficacy of adjuvant combination chemotherapy in postmenopausal patients can also be found in the results reported by other investigators who have never observed that menopausal status affected treatment outcome .
More recently ,  the Guy's Hospital and Manchester study groups reported the actuarial 5-yr RFS of a randomized study comparing radical mastectomy alone versus melphalan versus CMF and showed that the only group significantly improved by adjuvant CMF was that of postmenopausal women ,  while premenopausal patients had findings that were superimposable in all three treatment groups .
A trend favoring postmenopausal versus premenopausal women given adjuvant combination chemotherapy was also observed by the NSABP group .
Our results have been confirmed through different reports .
Whether combined chemotherapy-hormonal therapy in this group of patients could yield superior results compared to chemotherapy alone ,  remains to be determined not only through appropriate randomized studies ,  but also through long-term analyses .
Thus ,  from available reports it appears that different adjuvant treatments consisting of a single multidrug regimen can achieve comparable RFS results regardless of treatment duration .
