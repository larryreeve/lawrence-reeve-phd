Not one new study has been already reported ,  whereas the present Italian co-operative study closed patient accrual in November 1996 because of the results of the planned interim analysis .
The time of the analysis (November ,  1999) was 36 months after the last randomization .
Inclusion criteria were as follows ,  age ,  18 to 65 years ,  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2 ,  primary tumors subfascially localized with diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm ,  high-grade spindle-cell or polymorphous sarcomas (fibrosarcoma ,  malignant fibrous histiocytoma ,  polymorphous liposarcoma ,  leiomyosarcoma ,  synovial sarcoma ,  malignant schwannoma ,  angiosarcoma ,  and polymorphous rhabdomyosarcoma) ,  local relapse of any size ,  no previous radio/chemotherapy ,  adequate bone marrow (WBC count of >= 4,000/fiL ,  platelets = 120.000/mL ,  and hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL) ,  renal (creatinine <= 1.3 mg/dL) ,  hepatic (SGOT <= 2.5 X normal value and bilirubin <= 1.2 mg/dL) ,  and pulmonary functions .
Radical surgery consisted of amputation in case of massive involvement of critical structures or compartmental resection in highly selected patients .
Preoperative radiation therapy (44.8 Gy in 28 fractions in 2.5 weeks ,  160 cGy/ fraction ,  2 fractions per day) followed by resection with or without a post-or intraoperative boost (16 to 18 Gy for positive or close surgical margins) was used for tumors extending to critical structures for which conservative surgical resection was expected to be inadequate and amputation would usually have to be performed to obtain negative margins .
In the case of incomplete hematologic recovery (defined as WBC < 4,000/mL and platelets [PLTS] < 100.000/mL) ,  treatment was postponed by one or more weeks ,  furthermore ,  on complete hematologic recovery ,  a dose reduction of EPI was applied depending on the observed nadirs (WBC > 1,000/mL and PLTS > 75.000/mL ,  IFO and EPI doses both 100% ,  WBC > 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL ,  IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 75% ,  WBC < 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL ,  IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 50%) .
One patient refused the fifth and last cycle for personal reasons ,  and three patients did not complete the treatment because of related toxicities (reappearance of viral uveitis ,  consecutive episodes of pneumonitis ,  and persistent leukopenia) after two ,  three ,  and four cycles ,  respectively .
Univariate analyses did not reveal any statistically significant difference in overall DFS and OS for any of the characteristics considered (age ,  sex ,  center of surgery ,  histology ,  grading ,  site of primary tumor ,  presentation ,  diameter ,  local treatment ,  and stratification) with the exception of adjuvant treatment (data not shown) .
The preliminary data of previous studies were sometimes positive for DFS and OS , 15-19 but further analyses ,  made after an adequate follow-up time ,  indicated a disappearance of the positive effect of chemotherapy on 20,21 and ,  in some cases ,  worse results.22 However ,  the recently published meta-analysis , 7 involving 1,568 patients ,  showed a statistically significant benefit for treated patients of 6% ,  10% ,  and 10% for local ,  metastatic ,  and overall DFS ,  respectively ,  and a favorable (but not statistically significant) trend in OS (4%) ,  after a median of 9.4 years of follow-up .
In fact ,  disease stages ,  tumor sizes ,  and grading varied greatly.23 Second ,  eight studies made use of a polychemotherapy including an anthracycline ,  vincristine ,  cyclophosphamide ,  and dacarbazine ,  but only the first is active in soft tissue sarcomas ,  the others probably increased toxicity .
