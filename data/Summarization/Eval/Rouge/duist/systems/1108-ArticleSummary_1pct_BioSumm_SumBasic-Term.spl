The Southwest Oncology Group study compared pelvic radiotherapy alone with pelvic radiotherapy in combination with fluorouracil and cisplatin in high-risk patients  with involvement of lymph nodes or surgical margins who had undergone radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer stage IA2 ,  IB ,  or IIA (unpublished data) .
In the earlier Gynecologic Oncology Group study that assessed the value of extrafascial hysterectomy after radiotherapy ,  surgery was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of relapses in the pelvic region ,  but the overall risk of recurrence was not significantly reduced (relative risk ,  0.76 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.52 to 1.12) and there was no significant difference in survival (relative risk of death ,  0.91) .
