Introduction .
These regimens were selected for first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer ,  based on promising antitumour efficacy and an acceptable safety profile .
Methods .
Patients .
We obtained written informed consent from each patient before enrolment .
Approval was obtained from the ethics committee of each participating centre .
Study design .
We did the trial in 13 European countries ,  Israel ,  and South Africa .
Randomisation was done centrally in the study sponsor's office by a computer-generated random scheme ,  and was stratified by centre .
Further cancer treatment was also recorded .
Our primary endpoint was response rate .
Survival lasted from the date of randomisation to the date of death .
We also assessed quality of life .
The questionnaire includes five scales for functioning ,  one scale for global health status ,  and nine symptom scales .
Statistical analysis .
For continuous variables ,  we used Student's t tests .
We did log-rank tests stratified by this variable .
Multivariate analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population .
A logistic-regression model was used to identify the prognostic factors for response .
We based the selection of models of prognostic factors on a forward stepwise procedure ,  with the treatment being forced in the model .
To enter and remove terms in the model we used p=0.08 and p=0.10 ,  respectively .
The time to definitive deterioration from baseline by 5% ,  10% ,  20% ,  and 30% was analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method .
Results .
Efficacy .
Median followirinotecan group was 69.8% and 54.8% ,  respectively .
Safety .
Quality of life .
QL did not differ significantly between groups .
The same trend was seen with the second imputation method .
Discussion .
Those studies did not ,  however ,  show survival benefits .
