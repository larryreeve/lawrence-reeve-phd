INTRODUCTION .
Stage I cervical cancer has a relatively favorable prognosis with an 80 cure rate achieved with radical hysterectomy or radiotherapy .
However the 20 mortality after surgery has remained virtually unchanged during the past three decades .
Certain clinical and pathologic risk factors for Stage 1 cervical cancer recurrence have been identified .
However sufficient data have been reported in the literature to categorize LTD DSI and CLS as independent risk factors because of their frequent association with increased cancer recurrence and mortality .
Furthermore that study estimated that the proportion of women with such risk factors was 25 of all Stage IB cervical cancer patients with negative lymph nodes .
The results of that GOG study were subsequently published in 1990. Traditionally women with lymph node metastases have been treated with postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy .
Several authors proposed that patients with certain primary tumorrelated factors such as LTD DSI and CLS might also benefit from postoperative radiotherapy .
The studys target sample size was set at 169 eligible patients based on a desire to detect a 55 decrease in recurrence rate exponential model with l 5 0.01 recurrences/month with the use of radiation therapy .
Radiation therapy was started within 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively .
Intravenous pyelogram renal sonogram or computed tomography CT scan with contrast was to be done at 6 months and then yearly .
The difference between treatment regimens while adjusting for prognostic factors was accomplished using the Cox Model .
Imbalances between patient and disease characteristics and treatment regimens was accomplished using the Pearsons x2 test .
When the characteristic was continuous e.g. age the KruskalWallis test was used .
RESULTS .
Between March 1988 and September 1995 299 women were accessioned into the study .
Of the remaining 277 eligible patients 137 were randomly assigned to radiotherapy and 140 to no further treatment .
The distribution of individual risk factors between the treatment regimen was somewhat imbalanced .
There was a disproportionately larger number of patients with positive CLS among the NFT regimen 24 versus 35 and more patients with .4 cm diameter tumors in the RT regimen 62 versus 54. However the overall risk for recurrence was very similar in each regimen when all three risk factors were considered as a group See Cox Model analyses .
In addition 9 6.6 noncompliant patients had acceptable radiation doses 85 of 50.4 Gy but in excess of 20 protraction of overall treatment time .
The median follow-up is 5 years for those who are alive with no evidence of disease .
The risk factors used to select patients for this study have been investigated and reported in the literature .
Deep tumor invasion into cervical stroma measured either in millimeters or in thirds of the total cervical thickness has been also shown in association with lymph node metastases recurrence and poorer survival .
Boyce et al .
emphasized that a combination of risk factors correlated better with the survival than one factor alone .
Estimating tumor diameter by palpation is more subjective and imprecise than the direct measurement of the depth of invasion .
The use of adjuvant radiotherapy to improve the outcome in the Stage I cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter deep invasion and CLS has been previously proposed .
Increased morbidity in patients receiving full course radiotherapy following radical surgery for cervical cancer has been reported .
