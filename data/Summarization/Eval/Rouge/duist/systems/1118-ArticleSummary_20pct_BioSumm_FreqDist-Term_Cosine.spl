While no therapy has been proven more effective than radical external-beam plus intracavitary radiotherapy ,  considerable research effort ,  including addition of chemotherapy plus radiation ,  is currently being put into improving survival rate in patients with advanced carcinoma of the cervix .
The concurrent use of radiation and chemotherapy ,  either as a single agent or in combination ,  has also been demonstrated to be effective in the local control of advanced carcinoma of the cervix with acceptable toxicity as presented by several reports ,  and was also supported by our previous phase I and II trial .
Thus ,  we designed the randomized trial to compare the tumor response and survival rate of patients with advanced cervical carcinoma receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus patients receiving radiotherapy alone .
From October 1990 to April 1995 ,  patients with advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix were entered on the study and randomly assigned to either radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy .
The trial compared the efficacy and tolerability of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer .
Patients with previously untreated stage IIb bulky or stage IIIb advanced cervical carcinoma were eligible for study .
In the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group ,  chemotherapeutic regimens consisted of cisplatin (50 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously at the rate of 1 mg/min on Day 1) ,  vincristine (1 mg/m2 intravenously push on Day 2) ,  and bleomycin (25 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously infusion in divided doses on Days 2 ,  3 ,  and 4) which were given starting on Day 1 of radiotherapy and then every 3 weeks for a total of four courses .
The mean age of the patients was 56.2 years (range ,  33 ­ 68 years) in the concurrent group ,  and 58.7 years (range ,  41 ­ 69 years) in the radiotherapy group .
Of the chemoradiotherapy group ,  43 patients completed four courses of chemotherapy ,  11 patients received three courses ,  and 6 patients received two courses of chemotherapy .
Of the radiotherapy group ,  60 patients completed radiotherapy with no delays of treatment for toxicity ,  whereas the planned radiotherapy was interrupted for 1 week in 2 patients because of radiation protitis or neutropenia .
The duration of therapy for the patients was 59 days (range ,  49 ­ 78 days) versus 51 days (range ,  47 ­ 65 days) in the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups ,  respectively .
The incidence of delayed treatment was significantly higher in patients with concurrent chemoradiotherapy than those patients with radiation alone (15.0% versus 3.2% ,  P Å 0.02) .
The tumor response was significantly higher in patients receiving concurrent chemoradia tion than in pa tients who rece ived radiatio n alone (P = 0.04) .
The acute treatment-related toxicity (grade 3 or 4) appears to be higher with the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group when compared with radiation group (36.7% versus 17.7% ,  P Å 0.02) .
Although there was no significant difference between the two compared groups with regard to treatment-related late toxicity (concurrent group 23.3% versus radiation group 12.9% ,  P = 0.13) , a nonsignificant trend toward a higher rate of late toxicity in the chemoradiotherapy group is evident .
Survival Of the chemoradiotherapy group ,  31 patients (51.7%) are alive without evidence of disease ,  6 (10%) remain alive with disease ,  and 21 (35%) died of disease at 7 ­ 48 months .
Regarding patients with treatment incompleteness ,  those two patients who did not complete their planned treatment course because of treatment-related toxicity were dead of disease at 13 and 16 months .
Of the 9 patients requiring treatment delays ,  7 patients (77.8%) died of disease (5) or are alive with disease (2) ,  whereas 18 of the 49 patients (36.7%) who had completed their planned treatment without treatment delays died of disease or are alive with disease .
Of the radiation group ,  33 patients (53.2%) are alive without evidence of disease ,  7 (11.3%) remain alive with disease ,  and 22 (35.5%) died of disease at 12 ­ 45 months .
After a median follow-up of 46.8 months ,  the disease-free survival and actuarial survival rates at 3 years for patients in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group were not statistically different compared with patients in the radiotherapy group (51.7% versus 53.2% ,  P Å 0.92 ,  and 61.7% versus 64.5% ,  P Å 0.88 ,  respectively) .
Analysis by Kaplan ­ Meier method showed that the actuarial survival was not statistically different between the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups (mean survival time ,  38.1 months versus 41.5 months ,  P Å 0.27) .
Therefore ,  the design of a more efficient treatment modality ,  such as the addition of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy ,  with the objective of increasing tumor control and long-term survival for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma ,  is advocated .
Therefore ,  in an attempt to improve tumor control and survival in patients with advanced cervical carcinoma ,  the treatment efficacy and tolerability of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy using cisplatin-based chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer needs to be explored .
Over the past few years ,  there have been multiple studies published which have retrospectively analyzed the outcome of patients with advanced cervical carcinoma who received concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
The published trials in advanced cervical carcinoma with concurrent chemoradiotherapy ,  either a single-agent weekly cisplatin or in combination with cisplatin ­ 5-FU or cisplatin ­ bleomycin ­ vincristine ,  yield tumor response rates of approximately 80% ,  and 3-year survival rates reached 50 to 60% of patients .
Therefore ,  to test the hypothesis of concurrent chemoradiotherapy improving the survival rate of advanced cervical cancer ,  in 1990 we began a phase III randomized trial comparing concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus pelvic radiation alone in patients with advanced cervical carcinoma at our institution .
To further increase the systemic activity and the radiation-enhancing potential of the chemotherapy ,  we chose cisplatin-based regimens with vincristine and bleomycin in this trial because it had proven high efficacy of local control in our previous phase I and II trials for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
Although the response rate of 88.4% ,  following concurrent chemoradiotherapy ,  in our study is very encouraging when compared with 74.3% of the radiotherapy group at the end of therapy ,  this study does not provide evidence that chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone with respect to survival .
Indeed ,  in our trial ,  the treatment-related toxicity was severe and resulted in delayed radiotherapy in 15% of patients after chemoradiotherapy ,  in which 77.8% of patients with treatment delays recurred or died of disease .
Therefore ,  in patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix ,  improvement in local control will not translate into an improved long-term outcome because this gain will be offset by the eventual development of a relapse .
In conclusion ,  when comparing patients with concurrent therapy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to radiotherapy alone ,  our study showed that concurrent multiagent chemoradiotherapy did not prove to be a superior definitive therapy for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
