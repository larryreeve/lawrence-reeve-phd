Stage Ib and IIa carcinoma of the cervix can be cured by radical surgery or radiotherapy with similar effectiveness ,  but the rate and types of complications differ .
By contrast ,  radical surgery affords the opportunity to study pathological findings ,  so that groups of at-risk patients who could benefit from adjuvant treatment can be identified .
Methods .
Between September ,  1986 ,  and December ,  1991 ,  578 patients with primary invasive cervical cancer were referred to the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Radiation Oncology ,  at the Istituto di Scienze Biomediche S Gerardo ,  University of Milan ,  Monza .
We used the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) clinical staging system to classify the stage of cancer.7 If there was disagreement about the stage ,  the case was assigned to the earlier stage. 468 patients had FIGO stage Ib or IIa disease. 343 of these patients were enrolled after they had given their informed consent to take part .
The clinical evaluation of the patients was done by the gynaecological surgeon together with the radiation oncologist to avoid bias in the randomisation ,  in fact ,  patients with unfavourable clinical characteristics are usually treated by radiotherapy alone .
Patients were also stratified by cervical diameter (4 cm or >4 cm) .
After 2 weeks ,  one caesium-137 LDR insertion was carried out .
When lymphangiography showed common iliac or paraortic metastases ,  paraortic lymph nodes were treated with a dose of 45 Gy over 5 weeks and two shaped opposed fields (AP-PA) .
A boost of 5–10 Gy was given to the positive nodes .
Adjuvant radiotherapy consisted of external pelvic irradiation (18 MV X-rays) with the multiportal technique ,  one fraction of 1·8–2·0 Gy daily ,  with a total dose of 50·4 Gy over 5–6 weeks .
We compared quantitative data by one-way analysis of variance .
Of the 468 patients with FIGO stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  125 were excluded because of age (<30 years ,  >70 years ,  n=43) ,  medical illness (n=54) ,  previous or concurrent malignant disease (n=21) ,  or the referring physician’s or patient’s preference for surgery ,  radiotherapy ,  or chemoradiotherapy (n=7) .
After randomisation ,  there were six protocol violations ,  two in the surgery group (one progression before operation and one refusal of any therapy after randomisation) and four in the radiotherapy group (two patients whose cancer was incorrectly staged and two with synchronous neoplasia) .
These cases were analysed according to the original group they were allocated to (intention to treat) .
The overall crude survival for all patients included in the intention-to-treat analysis was 76·5% (258 of 337) .
The two groups did not differ significantly as regards squamous histotype ,  overall 5-year survival rates were 84% in surgery-group patients and 88% in radiotherapy-group patients ,  overall disease-free survival was 76% and 78% ,  respectively .
Of these 86 patients ,  60 (70%) died of disease .
Among the patients who developed recurrent disease ,  six (14%) in the surgery group and 13 (30%) in the radiotherapy group were cured ,  this difference was not significant (p=0·15) .
In particular ,  among radiotherapy-group patients with cervical diameter larger than 4 cm ,  the rate of pelvic relapse was more than twofold the rate of distant relapses (30% vs 13%) .
Grade 2 or 3 complications affected 19 (31%) patients who had surgery alone and 29 (27%) patients who received surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy (p=0·71) .
The sum of the short-term and long-term complications exceeds the total number of complications because some of the patients had multiple morbidity .
This accounts for an overall mortality rate of 0·6% .
Hydroureteronephrosis was recorded in ,  two (3%) of 61 patients who had surgery alone ,  11 (10%) of 108 patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy ,  and eight (5%) of 158 patients who had radiotherapy alone (p=0·1) .
In the radiotherapy group ,  one patient had intestinal perforation ,  one rectovaginal fistula ,  and 12 severe proctites.Severe oedema of the legs occurred in ten (9%) patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy ,  in one (0·6%) patient who had radiotherapy alone ,  and in none of the patients who had surgery alone .
Apart from survival ,  optimum treatment strategies depend on the benefits and disadvantages of each treatment and on prognostic factors (cervical diameter ,  histotype ,  and lymph-node status) .
Most complications can be easily corrected .
Most women with stage Ib–IIa cervical cancer can be treated successfully with radiotherapy ,  whereas a judicious selection of patients is necessary before planning primary radical surgery .
An Italian prospective randomised trial of radical radiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery in patients with squamous neoplasia and cervical diameters larger than 4 cm has been in progress since 1991 .
