Since our primary objective was to compare the treatment sequences ,  we chose to include patients with a variety of tumors reasonably treated with either MTX or 5-FU as single agents .
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. leukocyte count >3.0 x 10/L ,  platelet count > 100 x 10/L and adequate renal function (scrum creatinine <90 umol/L or creatinine clearance > 1.0 mL/sec) were required .
The inclusion of some patients with previously untreated stage II head and neck cancer reflected the opinion of the combined head and neck clinic that they were unsuitable for cure by surgery or radiotherapy .
In either case ,  the dose of MTX was 250 mg/m2 ,  and the dose of 5-FU was 600 mg/m2 .
Patients who showed complete or partial response received a further four courses at two-week intervals ,  while those with stable or progressive disease discontinued chemotherapy .
Subsequent treatment was dependent on the primary site and on prior treatment ,  but was defined by the protocol to be radiotherapy after completion of protocol chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer .
Statistical analysis used BMDP statistical software to prepare and compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves (program BMDPIL) for the group as a whole and for subgroups by primary site ,  treatment sequence ,  performance status ,  sex ,  age group ,  and response to therapy .
Among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  disease stage expressed as TNM separately and as stage grouping ,  using standard definitions of the American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging and- End Result reporting were also examined as possible prognostic factors for response and survival .
Chi square and Fisher's exact tests of the significance of differences in proportions responding to each treatment sequence were performed using standard formulas .
Variables included in the Cox models for all patients with head and neck cancer were treatment group ,  prior radiotherapy ,  performance status ,  sex ,  and prior surgery .
For previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  stage expressed as either stage group or as T ,  N ,  and M stage ,  separately and with two and three-way interactions were also included .
Altogether ,  108 patients were entered ,  including 70 with head and neck cancer of whom 49 had received no prior chemotherapy ,  no radiotherapy ,  and no surgical treatment beyond diagnostic biopsy .
Four patients ,  two on each treatment sequence ,  died of treatment-related complications (sepsis in two patients ,  diarrhea in one ,  and aspiration pneumonia in one patient) ,  and a further patient developed prolonged neurologic toxicity with coma but recovered fully .
Both treatment sequences were effective in head and neck cancer ,  producing an overall major response rate (complete and partial) of 46% of all entered patients ,  including 52% (95% confidence limits ,  39%-65%) of evaluable patients .
Even if the most extreme case is assumed and all four nonevaluable patients regarded as nonresponders ,  the difference was still not significant (P = .06 ,  Fisher's exact test ,  with no allowance for multiple comparisons) .
Cox model multivariate analysis showed that ECOG performance status at study entry was the most significant prognostic factor for survival duration (P < .001) ,  and that ,  among the 70 patients with head and neck cancer ,  when allowance was made for performance status ,  a survival difference in favor of the "reverse" FM sequence emerged (P < .025) .
Other factors including stage ,  sex ,  prior radiotherapy ,  and prior surgery were not significant .
