THE American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics define stage IB cervical cancer as invasive cancer that is confined to the cervix ,  with a depth of more than 5 mm and a width of more than 7 mm. In patients with large stage IB cervical cancers ,  local control and survival are poorer than in patients with smaller stage I cancers ,  whether treated by surgery or irradiation .
Several phase 2 studies have reported that concomitant treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy results in faster and more complete responses and better survival than expected with radiotherapy alone .
We elected to test this combination in a phase 3 trial to determine whether concurrent weekly treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy would improve progression-free survival and survival in women with large “bulky , ” or barrel-shaped ,  stage IB cervical cancers .
Inaddition ,  patients could have no radiographic evidence of lymphadenopathy on computed tomographic scanning or lymphangiography ,  and in those with enlarged or suspicious-appearing lymph nodes ,  no evidence of cancer on fine-needle aspiration or histologic evaluation .
Patients with histologic evidence of lymph-node involvementwere not eligible ,  nor were those who had previously received radiotherapy or chemotherapy or those with a history of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer .
All patients were required to have a Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status of 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  or 3 (equivalent to Karnofsky performance scores of 90 or 100 ,  70 or 80 ,  50 or 60 ,  and 30 or 40 ,  respectively) and adequate bone marrow ,  renal function ,  and hepatic function .
Written informed consent was obtained before entry into the study ,  fulfilling all institutional ,  state ,  and federal regulations .
All patients were scheduled to undergo external irradiation ,  intracavitary brachytherapy ,  and extrafascial hysterectomy ,  with half the patients randomly assigned to receive weekly intravenous infusions of cisplatin during the period of radiotherapy .
External irradiation was withheld if the white-cell count fell below 1000 per cubic millimeter and was resumed once the count rose above that level .
The dose to point A (a reference location 2 cm lateral and 2 cm superior to the cervical os) was 30 Gy ,  for a cumulative dose of 75 Gy ,  and the cumulative dose to point B (the pelvic wall) was 55 Gy .
Patients’ medical records ,  films ,  and pathology slides were reviewed by the appropriate Gynecologic Oncology Group committees .
The design called for a final analysis when 56 events (recurrences or deaths) had occurred in patients receiving the control regimen (radiotherapy alone) and provided the study with a statistical power of 80 percent with use of the log-rank test and a one-sided significance level of 0.05 .
The Cox model was used to evaluate the difference between treatment regimens ,  adjust for prognostic factors ,  and estimate the relative likelihood (and 95 percent confidence intervals) of survival and progression-free survival .
The first stopping rule was chosen to reject the null hypothesis at the 1 percent level ,  whereas the second was chosen so that the level of rejection for both interim tests was 2 percent .
Four were subsequently excluded after a central review by the pathology committee found that the specimen was inadequate for evaluation in the case of one patient , the primary lesion had been misidentified in the case of one patient ,  the cell type had been misidentified in the case of one patient ,  and the stage of the tumor had been overestimated in the case of one patient .
The median weekly dose of cisplatin was 39.0 mg per square meter (10th and 90th percentiles ,  32.3 and 40.3 ,  respectively ,  range ,  0 to 49.7) .
The median total treatment time was 50 days in both groups (Table 2) .
There were no treatment-related deaths ,  but 64 patients (35 percent) in the combined-therapy group had grade 3 (moderate) or grade 4 (severe) adverse effects ,  as compared with 25 patients (13 percent) in the group given radiotherapy alone .
Cox multiple regression analysis showed that the size of the tumor as assessed by physical examination and the histologic grade of the tumor were both significant prognostic factors .
In 1992 ,  when the current study was initiated ,  complete data on survival in the earlier trial were not available ,  but an early analysis showed a significantly lower rate of relapses in the pelvic region among women who underwent hysterectomy .
In that study ,  the combination of concurrent radiotherapy and cisplatin-containing chemotherapy was superior to treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy .
They compared treatment with radiation and hydroxyurea ,  treatment with radiation and weekly cisplatin ,  and treatment with radiation and hydroxyurea ,  cisplatin ,  and fluorouracil and found that the rate of relapse-free survival was significantly higher in both regimens containing cisplatin .
In addition to these three trials ,  two other randomized trials have also found that combining radiotherapy and cisplatin-containing chemotherapy improves survival and disease-free survival .
The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group study ,  whose results appear elsewhere in this issue of the Journal ,  compared pelvic and para-aortic radiotherapy with pelvic radiotherapy in  combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil in patients with clinical stage IB through IVA cervical cancer .
The Southwest Oncology Group study compared pelvic radiotherapy alone with pelvic radiotherapy in combination with fluorouracil and cisplatin in high-risk patients  with involvement of lymph nodes or surgical margins who had undergone radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer stage IA2 ,  IB ,  or IIA (unpublished data) .
In the earlier Gynecologic Oncology Group study that assessed the value of extrafascial hysterectomy after radiotherapy ,  surgery was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of relapses in the pelvic region ,  but the overall risk of recurrence was not significantly reduced (relative risk ,  0.76 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.52 to 1.12) and there was no significant difference in survival (relative risk of death ,  0.91) .
The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment ,  but they share a common result ,  all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin .
This remarkable consistency offers a compelling reason to consider cisplatin therapy in combination with radiotherapy as a new standard of care for patients with bulky stage IB ,  stage IIB through IVA ,  and high-risk cervical cancers .
