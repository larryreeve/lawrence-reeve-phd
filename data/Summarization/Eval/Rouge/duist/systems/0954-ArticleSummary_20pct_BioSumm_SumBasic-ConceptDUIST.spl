This result has been attributed to micrometastases ,  which determine prognosis regardless of the effect of the locoregional therapy .
Nevertheless ,  there are reasons to reconsider radiotherapy ,  including the limited value of adjuvant chemotherapy for bulky disease ,  a synergistic effect of chemotherapy plus radiation on residual locoregional tumor ,  and the possibility that eliminating bulky disease with radiation may improve the effect of chemotherapy ,  because chemotherapy may be more effective when the overall disease burden is low .
From 1979 through 1986 ,  318 premenopausal women with newly diagnosed stage I or II breast cancer were enrolled in the study after undergoing modified radical mastectomy if ,  after axillary-node dissection ,  one or more level I or II lymph nodes were found to be positive on pathological examination .
After written informed consent was obtained ,  the patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups ,  those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy plus locoregional radiotherapy in five fields (the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group ,  with 164 patients) and those receiving chemotherapy alone (the chemotherapy group ,  with 154 patients) .
The chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (600 mg per square meter of body-surface area) ,  methotrexate (40 mg per square meter) ,  and fluorouracil (600 mg per square meter) (the CMF regimen) ,  given intravenously every 21 days as described by Bonadonna et al. ,  initially for 12 months (80 patients) ,  and in the case of patients randomized after 1981 ,  for 6 months .
A direct internal mammary field delivered a dose of 35 Gy at a depth of 3 cm. All the fields were treated with cobalt-60 .
Also ,  as part of a second randomization ,  68 patients with estrogen-positive tumors were treated with radiationinduced ovarian ablation that included 20 Gy over a period of five days plus prednisone (7.5 mg per day) for two years ,  as described by Meakin et al. Among these 68 patients ,  33 were assigned to chemotherapy and 35 were assigned to chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
The analysis was donefor the whole group of 318 patients and also for subgroups with involvement in either one to three axillary nodes or four or more nodes .
Of the 176 patients with recurrences ,  the disease returned locoregionally as a first event in 55 and systemically in 169 ,  14 additional patients had locoregional recurrences after a systemic recurrence .
There was no difference with regard to any survival end point between the patients who had 12 months of chemotherapy and those who had only 6 months P 0.60 for disease-free survival at 15 years ,  P 0.70 for overall survival) .
Mortality from breast cancer was reduced by 29 percent in the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group (relative risk ,  0.71 ,  95 percent confidence interval , 0.51 to 0.99 ,  P 0.05) ,  with 62 deaths ,  as compared with 76 in the chemotherapy-only group ,  which represented an improvement of 10 percentage points in breast-cancer–specific survival (Fig. 3) .
There were 66 deaths in the group given the combined treatment and 78 deaths in the chemotherapy group ,  for a 26 percent reduction in overall mortality at 15 years (relative risk ,  0.74 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.53 to 1.02 ,  P 0.07) and an 8 percent improvement in overall survival (Table 2 and Fig. 4) .
The reduction in the relative risk of a recurrence that was obtained by adding radiation to chemotherapy was similar in the subgroup with one to three positive nodes and the subgroup with four or more positive nodes (Table 3) .
Interventions were required in six (an elastic sleeve in four ,  a pump in one ,  and physiotherapy in one) ,  as compared with five patients in the chemotherapy group ,  one of whom required physiotherapy .
This study of premenopausal women with breast cancer demonstrates that locoregional radiotherapy reduces the rates of locoregional and systemic relapses and the chance of dying from breast cancer .
Also ,  in various past trials different areas were encompassed in the irradiated volume ,  and the trials differed in techniques of radiation ,  treatment planning ,  age ,  nodal status ,  and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy .
Of these ,  only the Danish study found that radiotherapy had a benefit of a magnitude similar to that in our trial ,  and there was a significant survival benefit in favor of radiotherapy (P 0.001) .
The other eight studies were notsimilar to ours or the Danish trial ,  either because the number of randomized premenopausal patients was small or because the radiotherapy techniques or the chemotherapy schedules were heterogeneous .
Four randomized trials comparing breast irradiation with no irradiation in patients who underwent conservative surgery showed significant reductions in the rate of relapse in the breast but no effect on systemic recurrences or overall survival .
