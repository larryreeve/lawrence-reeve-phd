In 1988 the GOG initiated a prospective randomized study (GOG #92) ,  reported here ,  to investigate the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy for Stage I cervical cancer patients treated by conventional radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who were at high risk for recurrence ,  because of LTD ,  DSI ,  CLS ,  but excluding patients with lymph node metastases .
The GOG #92 multicenter prospective randomized study was designed to determine whether postoperative pelvic radiotherapy following radical hysterectomy and pelvic node dissection would reduce the rate of recurrence and decrease the mortality in Stage IB cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter ,  deep stromal invasion by tumor ,  and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces found on microscopic examination .
Other eligibility criteria for enrollment into the study included normal blood counts ,  normal liver and kidney function ,  absence of genitourinary tract abnormality as determined by intravenous pyelogram ,  renal sonogram ,  or computerized tomography ,  and absence of intercurrent diseases or other conditions that might not permit completion of the study or the required follow-up .
There were 128 (46%) patients with the risk factors of positive CLS and deep one-third stromal invasion ,  65 (23%) had positive CLS ,  middle third stromal invasion and tumor size $2 cm ,  82 (30%) had negative CLS ,  middle or deep third stromal invasion and a $4-cm tumor ,  and 2 (0.7%) had positive CLS ,  superficial stromal invasion ,  and tumor size $5 cm (Table 3) .
The Cox model analysis indicated that when adjusting for all combinations of the three risk factors—tumor size ,  CLS ,  and the depth of invasion—the risk of recurrence was significantly reduced by 44% in the radiation group (P 5 0.019 ,  one-tail) .
Other serious adverse effects regressed either spontaneously (transient paraplegia in one patient) ,  or after treatment (percutaneous nephrostomies for bilateral ureteral obstruction and transfusion of packed cells for severe anemia with a drop of hematocrit to 20%) .
One report showed that postoperative radiation “prevented local recurrences and improved ten year tumor-free-survival” in a small number of women with CLS ,  DSI ,  and microscopically involved lymph nodes .
More recently ,  Thomas and Dembo postulated that women with negative nodes but primary tumor-related poor prognostic factors were more likely to recur in the pelvis than in distant sites and ,  therefore ,  may benefit from pelvic irradiation .
