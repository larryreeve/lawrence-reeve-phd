THE American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics define stage IB cervical cancer as invasive cancer that is confined to the cervix ,  with a depth of more than 5 mm and a width of more than 7 mm. In patients with large stage IB cervical cancers ,  local control and survival are poorer than in patients with smaller stage I cancers ,  whether treated by surgery or irradiation .
The optimal treatment of large stage IB cervical cancer has been a source of controversy since the late 1960s .
METHODS .
Patients .
Radiotherapy .
Standard Fletcher–Suit or Henschke applicators were used .
Chemotherapy .
Hysterectomy .
The corpus and cervix were removed but not contiguous parametrial tissue .
The uterine vessels were transected at the uterine wall medial to the ureters ,  which were not unroofed .
No vaginal cuff was removed .
Quality Control and Follow-up .
Outcome .
Recurrences were classified as local if they were detected in the pelvis ,  cervix ,  or vagina and as distant if they were detected in extrapelvic locations .
Statistical Analysis .
All reported P values are two-tailed .
RESULTS .
Characteristics of the Patients .
There were no significant differences in demographic or tumor characteristics between the two groups (Table 1) .
Adverse Effects .
Survival .
The median duration of follow-up was 36 months .
Prognostic Factors .
DISCUSSION .
This approach was ,  however ,  associated with considerable morbidity .
Like others ,  we found that the size of the tumor was an important prognostic factor .
Various drugs have been used in clinical trials and  increasingly in clinical practice in the past 15 years .
The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment ,  but they share a common result ,  all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin .
