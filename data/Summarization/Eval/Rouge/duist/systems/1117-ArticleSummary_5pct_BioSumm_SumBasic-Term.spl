Eligibility criteria were ,  age 30–70 years ,  newly diagnosed stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  no concurrent or previous malignant disease ,  WHO performance status of 1 or less ,  and feasibility of both radical surgery and radiotherapy .
A complete computerised plane was made ,  according to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements report no 38.8 The total dose at point A (external beam plus brachyradiotherapy) ranged from 70 Gy to 90 Gy (median 76 Gy) .
Patients who had at least one of the following pathological risk factors received adjuvant radiotherapy ,  surgical stage greater than pT2a ,  less than 3 mm of uninvolved cervical stroma ,  cutthrough ,  and lymph-node metastases .
The overall and disease-free actuarial 5-year survival for all patients were 83% and 74% ,  respectively ,  and did not differ significantly between the groups (figure 2). 5-year actuarial survival stratified by cervical diameter was similar in the surgery and radiotherapy groups (diameter < 4 cm ,  87% vs 90% ,  diameter >4 cm ,  70% vs 72% ,  figure 3 ,  table 3). 5-year actuarial disease-free survival for the surgery and radiotherapy groups was 80% and 82% ,  respectively ,  for patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or smaller ,  and 63% and 57% for those with a diameter larger than 4 cm ,  the between group differences were not significant .
Of the 86 patients who developed a recurrence ,  50 (58%) had local or pelvic recurrence (22 [52%] in the surgery group vs 28 [64%] in the radiotherapy group ,  p=0·42) ,  and 36 (42%) had distant metastases (20 [48%] vs 16 [36%] ,  p=0·62) ,  five of these 36 patients also had a pelvic recurrence .
In addition ,  among women with a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm ,  there was a significantly higher rate of pelvic relapse among those who had radiotherapy than among those who had surgery plus adjuvant irradiation (16 [70%] vs 9 [53%] ,  p=0·46) .
Other vesical complications (severe actinic cystitis ,  stress incontinence ,  high-pressure bladder) were recorded in two (3%) patients after surgery ,  11 (10%) after surgery plus radiotherapy ,  and in eight (5%) after radiotherapy alone .
In Italy ,  a prospective randomised trial has been under way since 1993 to assess the best adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) for high-risk patients after radical surgery for FIGO stage Ib–IIa cancer .
