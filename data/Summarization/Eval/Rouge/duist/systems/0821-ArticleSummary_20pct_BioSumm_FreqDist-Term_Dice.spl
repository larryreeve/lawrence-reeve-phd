Patients eligible for this study had measurable or evaluable advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck , adenocarcinoma of the colon ,  rectum or stomach ,  or SCC of other primary site (Table I) .
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. leukocyte count >3.0 x 10/L ,  platelet count > 100 x 10/L and adequate renal function (scrum creatinine <90 umol/L or creatinine clearance > 1.0 mL/sec) were required .
Patients received oral or IV bicarbonate to ensure a urine pH of at least 7.0 at the time of MTX administration and for 24 hours thereafter ,  then oral folinic acid rescue (FAR) for eight doses of 15 mg each 6 hours commencing 24 hours after the MTX .
Statistical analysis used BMDP statistical software to prepare and compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves (program BMDPIL) for the group as a whole and for subgroups by primary site ,  treatment sequence ,  performance status ,  sex ,  age group ,  and response to therapy .
Among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  disease stage expressed as TNM separately and as stage grouping ,  using standard definitions of the American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging and- End Result reporting were also examined as possible prognostic factors for response and survival .
These univariate analyses were supplemented by stepwise Cox model multivariate survival comparison (program BMDP2L) ,  selecting default conditions for the inclusion and exclusion of terms ,  and the MPLR stepping option .
Although the pretreatment stratification was by primary site only ,  a reasonable balance of prognostic factors was achieved (Table 1) ,  but there was a trend to less favorable performance status in the group receiving 5-FU before MTX .
The treatments were well tolerated in most patients ,  with a low incidence of hematologic and no significant renal toxicity (Table 2) ,  but occasional severe diarrhea or mucositis occurred ,  apparently despite normal renal function and FAR .
Four patients ,  two on each treatment sequence ,  died of treatment-related complications (sepsis in two patients ,  diarrhea in one ,  and aspiration pneumonia in one patient) ,  and a further patient developed prolonged neurologic toxicity with coma but recovered fully .
Both treatment sequences were effective in head and neck cancer ,  producing an overall major response rate (complete and partial) of 46% of all entered patients ,  including 52% (95% confidence limits ,  39%-65%) of evaluable patients .
This was most extreme among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  of this subgroup 65% responded to the sequence of MF ,  while 39% of entered patients including 47% of those evaluable for response ,  responded to the reverse FM sequence (P = .18 ,  Fisher's exact test) .
Even if the most extreme case is assumed and all four nonevaluable patients regarded as nonresponders ,  the difference was still not significant (P = .06 ,  Fisher's exact test ,  with no allowance for multiple comparisons) .
Because most responding patients with head and neck cancer received radiotherapy while still in response ,  no meaningful response duration could be determined ,  instead survival times are presented (Table 3) ,  with a median survival of at least 13 months in all groups .
Survival duration was not significantly different by treatment sequence in univariate analyses ,  though the trend favored the sequence of 5-FU before MTX ,  in which the median survival had not been reached at 23 months ,  compared to a median survival of 13.3 months in the group receiving MTX before 5-FU .
Cox model multivariate analysis showed that ECOG performance status at study entry was the most significant prognostic factor for survival duration (P < .001) ,  and that ,  among the 70 patients with head and neck cancer ,  when allowance was made for performance status ,  a survival difference in favor of the "reverse" FM sequence emerged (P < .025) .
Because the question at issue was the sequence of drug administration rather than the study of a particular tumor type ,  we chose to include patients with SCCs of the head and neck ,  colorectal or gastric adenocarcinoma ,  and other SCCs reasonably treated by either MTX or 5-FU .
In the small number of patients with colorectal cancer we observed a response rate of 33% (40% of evaluable patients) ,  a figure somewhat higher than that usually seen after 5-FU as a single agent ,  but the 95% confidence limits for this rate (19%-64%) emphasize that this could be a chance observation .
