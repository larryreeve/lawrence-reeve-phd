advanced colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common oncologic challenges encountered in the western world 
the log rank statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with equality of survival curves while the cox partial likelihood score statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with the hypothesis that any one of the combinations would yield at least a 50 improvement in survival over 5 fu alone 
it is noteworthy that while the mof strept regimen had the highest regression rate it was also the regimen with the lowest proportion of patients whose disease remained stable and the highest proportion of patients in whom the best response observed was tumor regression 
the purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate by such a randomized and controlled comparison a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5 fu activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials 
nevertheless there is little evidence of effective therapy for such patients other than symptomatic and supportive care 5 fluorouracil 5 fu is considered by many as the standard of chemotherapy but in larger experiences with this agent response rates have only been in the 15 to 20 range 
the total dose of 5 fu in this combination was only 12 of the dosage of 5 fu used alone that would produce a comparable degree of hematologic toxicity 
a hope frequently pursued in clinical research has been that the activity of 5 fu can be enhanced either by adding the activity of other cytotoxic drugs or more recently by favorably modulating the effects of 5 fu itself 
at the time of this writing the study is very mature with 318 patients 95 having shown progressive disease and 278 patients 83 having been followed to the time of death 
for the comparison of any one of our drug combinations with 5 fu this would permit our test for treatment effect to have 90 probability of detecting a true doubling in survival time eg from 6 to 12 months while having only a 05 probability of obtaining a false positive result when there were no true differences in survival 
standard criteria for declaring objective response were used ie a 5017 or greater reduction in the product of longest perpendicular diameters of bidimensionally measurable lesions or a 30 or greater decrease in the sum of liver measurements below the xyphoid process at costal margin 
an interesting sidelight of this study is the fact that grade of tumor anaplasia was found to be a powerful prognostic determinant matching the more well established performance status and presence or absence of measurable disease 
our experience with the 5 fu levamisole combination was particularly discouraging in view of the early study of the university of wisconsin indicating that this combination could produce substantial survival improvement 
to date there has been no convincing evidence that any chemotherapy of colorectal cancer contributes to either the duration or the quality of life 
this factor was imbalanced among our treatment regimens but this imbalance clearly weighed against the 5 fu arm that had the lowest proportion of low grade lesions and the highest proportion of highly anaplastic tumors 
an exception to the requirement for histologic confirmation of metastasis was made in the patient with a previous histologically confirmed primary colorectal carcinoma and who presented with multiple pulmonary metastasis that had shown progression on two chest x rays taken at least 1 month apart 
in the study of woodcock et al the single colorectal cancer patient treated who was not a prior 5 fu failure had a response of 8 months duration 
two randomized controlled studies have raised the possibility that it may have some role in the treatment of colorectal carcinoma 
overall therapeutic results were discouraging specifically in colorectal cancer a mayo clinic study demonstrated only one response among 30 patients a study of the baltimore cancer research program showed no responses among 21 patients and a new york memorial study demonstrated only two minor responses among 19 evaluated patients 
although a large number of alternative drugs have been studied in colorectal cancer none has exceeded the meager effectiveness of 5 fu 
mof strept was characterized by substantially more frequent and more severe nausea and vomiting and this was the only regimen characterized by a substantive incidence of thrombocytopenia 5 fu plus pala had substantially more frequent mucocutaneous reactions and somewhat more frequent diarrhea but less hematologic toxicity than 5 fu alone or any of the other regimens 
the most unique toxicity of this regimen was a substantially increased incidence of neurologic effects 
in spite of the fact that the patients tested were in very good overall general condition with no previous chemotherapy exposure none of our experimental regimens produced any meaningful advantage over therapy with simple 5 fu alone and none can be recommended for standard practice 
martin has pointed out that it might be possible to obtain the full biochemical modulating effect of pala by using a considerably lower dose of this agent thereby allowing the 5 fu dose to be increased to near full therapeutic levels 
this however was purchased at the price of disagreeable nausea and vomiting and the additional toxic problems of thrombocytopenia 
one cannot conclude that this regimen added to the quality of patient life and since it did not add to duration of life we must conclude that this regimen has little to recommend it 
the second study conducted at the university of wisconsin madison showed that advanced disease patients treated with combined 5 fu and levamisole lived significantly longer than patients treated with 5 fu alone 
in the study of vogel et al two of five previously untreated colorectal cancer patients responded for 4 and 7 months 
the fact that all tissue was subjected to a common pathology review process may have produced sufficient uniformity of grading to allow this characteristic to be a useful predictor of survival 
we would hope this could be done more successfully with increasing knowledge of how best to apply the results of experimental models in the clinical settings 
if this result could be confirmed it would be the first time that any regimen has demonstrated such significant survival improvement for advanced colorectal cancer in randomized trials 
in agreement with the new york memorial group and in contrast with the gastrointestinal tumor study group results we did record a moderately high response rate with the mofstrept combination 
the evaluation consisted of a history and physical examination measurement of indicator lesions hematology and chemistry panel including serum creatinine urinalysis and a chest x ray
