As in the disease-free analysis ,  secondary analyses of survival considering either all patients randomized or only patients who received treatment after the completion of radiation therapy ,  resulted in no meaningful change in direction or magnitude of the RR attributed to treatment with the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen (RR = 1.10 ,  95% CI ,  .72 to 1.67 ,  and RR = 1.04 ,  95% CI ,  .65 to 1.67 ,  respectively) .
Furthermore ,  studies in metastatic colorectal disease demonstrating enhanced efficacy of 5-FU when administered with leucovorin ,  as well as a recent report indicating a reduction in the rate of recurrence in colon cancer when levamisole was added to adjuvant 5-FU ,  have led to an intergroup trial assessing the value of such combinations as adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer (Intergroup Rectal Adjuvant protocol ,  Int 0114 ,  activated August 1990) .
