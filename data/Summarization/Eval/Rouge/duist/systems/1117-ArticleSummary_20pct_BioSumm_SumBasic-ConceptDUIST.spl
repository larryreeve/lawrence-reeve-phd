By contrast ,  radical surgery affords the opportunity to study pathological findings ,  so that groups of at-risk patients who could benefit from adjuvant treatment can be identified .
Our main aim was to evaluate 5-year survival and the rate and pattern of complications and recurrences associated with each procedure .
All patients received standard pretreatment evaluation ,  which included complete blood analysis ,  intravenous pyelogram ,  lymphangiography ,  cystoscopy ,  chest radiography ,  and other tests when indicated .
We used the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) clinical staging system to classify the stage of cancer.7 If there was disagreement about the stage ,  the case was assigned to the earlier stage. 468 patients had FIGO stage Ib or IIa disease. 343 of these patients were enrolled after they had given their informed consent to take part .
Eligibility criteria were ,  age 30–70 years ,  newly diagnosed stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  no concurrent or previous malignant disease ,  WHO performance status of 1 or less ,  and feasibility of both radical surgery and radiotherapy .
Radiotherapy included ,  external pelvic irradiation with 18 MV photon beam by the multiportal technique ,  one dose of 1·8–2·0Gy at the isocentre ,  and two or more portals treated daily .
The median total dose of radiation was 47 (range 40–53) Gy during 3–5 weeks ,  depending on the tumour volume and nodal status .
A complete computerised plane was made ,  according to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements report no 38.8 The total dose at point A (external beam plus brachyradiotherapy) ranged from 70 Gy to 90 Gy (median 76 Gy) .
When lymphangiography showed common iliac or paraortic metastases ,  paraortic lymph nodes were treated with a dose of 45 Gy over 5 weeks and two shaped opposed fields (AP-PA) .
The pathologist provided us with histological subtypes ,  grade ,  depth of invasion ,  tumour size ,  presence of capillary-like-space involvement ,  paracervical-tissue involvement ,  and number ,  site ,  and type of lymph-node metastases .
We classified complications as ,  grade 1 ,  mild symptoms not affecting the patient’s health and easily cured ,  grade 2 ,  symptoms that can be resolved by long-term medical therapies ,  grade 3 ,  major symptoms that require surgery or invasive procedures and affect the performance status of the patient ,  or fatal complications .
We used multivariate Cox regression analysis to assess the effect of cervical size ,  age ,  FIGO state ,  histological type ,  grade of differentiation ,  radiological lymph-node status ,  and treatment group on overall survival .
After randomisation ,  there were six protocol violations ,  two in the surgery group (one progression before operation and one refusal of any therapy after randomisation) and four in the radiotherapy group (two patients whose cancer was incorrectly staged and two with synchronous neoplasia) .
Lymphangiography revealed positive nodes in 24 (14%) surgery-group patients and in 22 (13%) radiotherapy group patients .
Adjuvant radiotherapy was done in 62 (54%) of the 114 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter of 4 cm or smaller and in 46 (84%) of 55 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm. 19 patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or less and three patients whose cervical diameter was greater than 4 cm had lymph-vascular-space involvement as the only pathological risk factor ,  these patients did not receive postoperative irradiation .
No patient was lost to follow-up. 11 patients died of intercurrent disease and two from fatal complications (bowel perforation and pulmonary embolism) .
The overall and disease-free actuarial 5-year survival for all patients were 83% and 74% ,  respectively ,  and did not differ significantly between the groups (figure 2). 5-year actuarial survival stratified by cervical diameter was similar in the surgery and radiotherapy groups (diameter < 4 cm ,  87% vs 90% ,  diameter >4 cm ,  70% vs 72% ,  figure 3 ,  table 3). 5-year actuarial disease-free survival for the surgery and radiotherapy groups was 80% and 82% ,  respectively ,  for patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or smaller ,  and 63% and 57% for those with a diameter larger than 4 cm ,  the between group differences were not significant .
Overall survival for the 108 surgery-group patients who received adjuvant treatment (high-risk group) compared with the patients with surgery alone (low-risk group) or radiotherapy alone (unknown risk) is shown in figure 4 ,  .
Among the patients who developed recurrent disease ,  six (14%) in the surgery group and 13 (30%) in the radiotherapy group were cured ,  this difference was not significant (p=0·15) .
Patients who had a treatment crossover were excludedfrom the analysis because the same factors that induced the treatment crossover could have affected the subsequent morbidity .
Two deaths were related to the primary treatment ,  both in the surgery group ,  ileal spontaneous perforation (11 months after adjuvant radiotherapy) and pulmonary embolism (17 days after surgery) .
Other vesical complications (severe actinic cystitis ,  stress incontinence ,  high-pressure bladder) were recorded in two (3%) patients after surgery ,  11 (10%) after surgery plus radiotherapy ,  and in eight (5%) after radiotherapy alone .
Surgery also offers other advantages ,  pelvic relapses can be successfully cured by radiotherapy ,  whereas salvage surgery after primary irradiation carries a high rate of failures and severe morbidity .
Morbidity is associated with both treatment strategies ,  though the most severe complications ,  such as operative mortality ,  urological complications ,  and tissue damage from irradiation ,  have been reduced during the past 20 years .
On the other hand ,  the low rate of major complications after radiotherapy (12%) suggests that this approach is well-tolerated by most patients. 25% of the surgery-group patients and 26% patients in the radiotherapy group developed neoplastic recurrence .
The pelvic area (including vagina and cervix ,  when present) was involved in 22 (52%) of 42 relapses after surgery and in 28 (64%) of 44 relapses after radiotherapy .
Our study was not aimed to assess the usefulness of the postoperative treatment ,  though our finding that patients treated with surgery plus radiotherapy were exposed to early and late complicationsof both treatments is important .
This finding should resolve some of the conflicting approaches to this issue.14–16 Our results suggest that the optimum candidates for primary radical surgery are women with normal ovarian function and cervical diameters of 4 cm or smaller ,  whereas radiotherapy is preferable for postmenopausal women .
Women whose cervical diameters are larger than 4 cm should be identified before surgery so that they can benefit from tailored treatment ,  radical radiotherapy ,  with the option of concomitant radiosensitising chemotherapy to improve the local control of the disease ,  or cisplatinbased chemotherapy followed by radical surgery .
