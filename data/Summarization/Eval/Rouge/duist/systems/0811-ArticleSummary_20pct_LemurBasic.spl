nevertheless there is little evidence of effective therapy for such patients other than symptomatic and supportive care 5 fluorouracil 5 fu is considered by many as the standard of chemotherapy but in larger experiences with this agent response rates have only been in the 15 to 20 range 
a hope frequently pursued in clinical research has been that the activity of 5 fu can be enhanced either by adding the activity of other cytotoxic drugs or more recently by favorably modulating the effects of 5 fu itself 
although enhanced activity by such methods has occasionally been suggested in pilot studies or in phase 2 trials these claims have seldom been substantiated by the essential definitive study a randomized comparison with 5 fu used alone 
the purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate by such a randomized and controlled comparison a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5 fu activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials 
we chose for our evaluation the combinations of 5 fu with thymidine with n phosphonacetyl laspartic acid pala with levamisole and with methyl ccnu vincristine and streptozotocin mof strept 
thymidine given at high doses in animal model systems has been shown to increase both therapeutic activity and toxicity of 5 fu and to improve the therapeutic index of this agent 
rustum demonstrated in colon 26 tumor and in a transplanted colon tumor in rats that thymidine plus 5 fu produced a significant prolongation of survival time when compared with 5 fu alone 
studies by woodcock et al by kirkwood and frei and by vogel et a1 demonstrated that in humans pretreatment with thymidine increased the biologic activity of 5 fu up to eight fold as measured by hematologic toxicity 
overall therapeutic results were discouraging specifically in colorectal cancer a mayo clinic study demonstrated only one response among 30 patients a study of the baltimore cancer research program showed no responses among 21 patients and a new york memorial study demonstrated only two minor responses among 19 evaluated patients 
continued interest in pala however was stimulated by animal model evidence that this agent inhibits pyrimidine synthesis and thereby enhances 5 fu activity by increasing its conversion to fluorouridine monophosphate fump 
the second study conducted at the university of wisconsin madison showed that advanced disease patients treated with combined 5 fu and levamisole lived significantly longer than patients treated with 5 fu alone 
with this background we initiated a randomized controlled comparison of 5 fu alone with 5 fu plus high dose thymidine 5 fu plus pala 5 fu plus levamisole and mof strept 
an exception to the requirement for histologic confirmation of metastasis was made in the patient with a previous histologically confirmed primary colorectal carcinoma and who presented with multiple pulmonary metastasis that had shown progression on two chest x rays taken at least 1 month apart 
contraindications to selection included a wbc count 4 000 mm or a platelet count 130 000 mm a serum creatinine 1 5 mg dl complete disability eastern cooperative oncology group iecog performance score 4 recent major surgery exploration and biopsy only 14 days resection or bypass surgery 21 days an uncontrolled infectious process frequent vomiting or severe anorexia any previous chemotherapy and intensive radiation to the axial skeleton within the preceding 4 weeks 
the single doses of thymidine and 5 fu were repeated at 4 week intervals 5 fuplus pala 5 fu was administered by rapid iv injection at a dosage of 300 mg m2 for 5 consecutive days 
courses of therapy were repeated every 5 weeks 5 fu plus levamisole 5 fu was administered in undiluted form by rapid iv injection at a dose of 500 mg m 2 d for 5 consecutive days 
mof strept 5 fu was administered in undiluted form by rapid iv injection at a dose of 300 mg m 2 d on days i through 5 and 36 through 40 
for the comparison of any one of our drug combinations with 5 fu this would permit our test for treatment effect to have 90 probability of detecting a true doubling in survival time eg from 6 to 12 months while having only a 05 probability of obtaining a false positive result when there were no true differences in survival 
standard criteria for declaring objective response were used ie a 5017 or greater reduction in the product of longest perpendicular diameters of bidimensionally measurable lesions or a 30 or greater decrease in the sum of liver measurements below the xyphoid process at costal margin 
the log rank statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with equality of survival curves while the cox partial likelihood score statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with the hypothesis that any one of the combinations would yield at least a 50 improvement in survival over 5 fu alone 
four patients were lost to analysis due to ineligibility or cancellation on the 5 fu alone arm four patients on 5 fu plus pala two patients on 5 fu plus thymidine two patients on mof strept and none on 5 fu plus levamisole 
mof strept was characterized by substantially more frequent and more severe nausea and vomiting and this was the only regimen characterized by a substantive incidence of thrombocytopenia 5 fu plus pala had substantially more frequent mucocutaneous reactions and somewhat more frequent diarrhea but less hematologic toxicity than 5 fu alone or any of the other regimens 
it is noteworthy that while the mof strept regimen had the highest regression rate it was also the regimen with the lowest proportion of patients whose disease remained stable and the highest proportion of patients in whom the best response observed was tumor regression 
there was no suggestion that any of the combination regimens performed in a superior fashion to 5 fu used alone and it is unlikely that any could produce as much as a 50 increase in time to progression p 05 for each regimen v 5 fu alone 
this factor was imbalanced among our treatment regimens but this imbalance clearly weighed against the 5 fu arm that had the lowest proportion of low grade lesions and the highest proportion of highly anaplastic tumors 
this was confirmed by a stratified cox analysis adjusting for key prognostic covariates which indicated that the data were inconsistent with any combination regimen yielding a 50 increase in survival relative to 5 fu ie a hazard ratio of 1 5 wherefore 5 fu plus pala p 01 5 fu plus thymidine p 0001 5 fu plus levamisole p 01 and mof strept p 05 
in spite of the fact that the patients tested were in very good overall general condition with no previous chemotherapy exposure none of our experimental regimens produced any meaningful advantage over therapy with simple 5 fu alone and none can be recommended for standard practice 
martin has pointed out that it might be possible to obtain the full biochemical modulating effect of pala by using a considerably lower dose of this agent thereby allowing the 5 fu dose to be increased to near full therapeutic levels 
our experience with the 5 fu levamisole combination was particularly discouraging in view of the early study of the university of wisconsin indicating that this combination could produce substantial survival improvement 
one cannot conclude that this regimen added to the quality of patient life and since it did not add to duration of life we must conclude that this regimen has little to recommend it 
an interesting sidelight of this study is the fact that grade of tumor anaplasia was found to be a powerful prognostic determinant matching the more well established performance status and presence or absence of measurable disease 
the fact that all tissue was subjected to a common pathology review process may have produced sufficient uniformity of grading to allow this characteristic to be a useful predictor of survival
