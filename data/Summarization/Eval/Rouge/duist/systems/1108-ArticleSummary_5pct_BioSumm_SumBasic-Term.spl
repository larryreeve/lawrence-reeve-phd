We elected to test this combination in a phase 3 trial to determine whether concurrent weekly treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy would improve progression-free survival and survival in women with large “bulky , ” or barrel-shaped ,  stage IB cervical cancers .
At the time of this analysis ,  69 patients in the group receiving the control regimen had had a recurrence of disease and 49 had died — 88 percent of the number of deaths needed for a final analysis of survival .
All patients had primary cervical cancers that were at least 4 cm in diameter ,  and the distribution of the tumors according to size was similar in the two groups .
More patients in the group given radiotherapy alone refused to undergo the operation (nine ,  vs. five in the combined-therapy group) ,  and more patients in this group also had an early recurrence (eight vs. two) .
The Southwest Oncology Group study compared pelvic radiotherapy alone with pelvic radiotherapy in combination with fluorouracil and cisplatin in high-risk patients  with involvement of lymph nodes or surgical margins who had undergone radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer stage IA2 ,  IB ,  or IIA (unpublished data) .
Although this regimen was also associated with higher rates of adverse effects ,  these effects consisted predominantly of transient hematologic and gastrointestinal effects ,  with no evidence of an increase in other serious effects .
In the earlier Gynecologic Oncology Group study that assessed the value of extrafascial hysterectomy after radiotherapy ,  surgery was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of relapses in the pelvic region ,  but the overall risk of recurrence was not significantly reduced (relative risk ,  0.76 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.52 to 1.12) and there was no significant difference in survival (relative risk of death ,  0.91) .
