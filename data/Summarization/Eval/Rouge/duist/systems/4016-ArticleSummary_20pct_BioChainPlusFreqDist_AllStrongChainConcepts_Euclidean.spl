Colorectal cancer is one of the most common adult  malignant tumours ,  affecting one person in twenty in the  USA and in most developed countries .
To be eligible for randomisation ,  patients had to meet the following criteria ,  histologically proven metastatic colorectal cancer ,  progressive metastatic disease documented on the basis of either a 25% increase in the size of target lesions or an increase in carcinoembryonic antigen by 1.25 times an initial reference value and a baseline value of more than 10 ug/L ,   which allowed inclusion of patients with non-measurable  disease (peritoneal carcinomatosis and pelvic recurrences) ,   progression documented by two measurements not separated by  more than 6 months and tumour progression while on  fluorouracil or within 6 months of the last fluorouracil infusion ,  having had one adjuvant and/or no more than two palliative  fluorouracil-based regimens ,  age 18-75 years ,  WHO performance status 0.2 ,  neutrophils 2 10/L or more ,  platelets  100x10/L or more ,  total bilirubin 1.25 the institutional upper normal limit (IUNL) ,  or less ,  liver transaminases 3xIUNL (in  case of liver metastases ,  bilirubin <=1.5 IUNL and  transaminases <=5 IUNL) ,  or more ,  serum creatinine  135 umol/L or less ,  wash-out of 4 weeks for radiotherapy or  chemotherapy ,  and written informed consent .
All adverse events were reported according to  the National Cancer Institute's common toxicity criteria .
Quality of life .
A retrospective stratification was planned to take into account the baseline prognostic factors (sex ,  age ,  performance status ,  weight loss ,  presence of liver metastases ,  site of primary tumour ,  number of  metastatic sites ,  response to and duration of fluorouracil treatment as well as its intent [adjuvant or palliative] ,   haemoglobin ,  white blood cells ,  platelets ,  lactate  dehydrogenase ,  transaminases ,  alkaline phosphatase ,  bilirubin ,  protein ,  and carcinoembryonic antigen) .
Model selection for identifying the variables having an effect on survival was based on a forward stepwise procedure. p values to enter and to remove were 0.05 and 0.06 ,  respectively .
After the prognostic model had been determined ,  the effect of treatment after adjusting for other prognostic factors was  estimated by including it in the model .
Quality-of-life variables were compared with multivariate and univariate analyses of variance on values at baseline ,  during  study ,  on patients' worst score over the trial period ,  and changes  from baseline .
These characteristics were similar for both groups except for performance status (more patients having poor performance status in the supportive-care group were assessed by carcinoembryonic antigen only ,  with mean antigen ratios versus reference values of 2.24 and 2.83 ,  respectively .
There were 123 (65%) events in the irinotecan  group ,  median duration of which was 9.2 (range 0-18.9)  months .
In the supportive-care group there were 71 (79%) events ,  the median duration of which was  6.5 (range 0.7-19.3) months .
Median follow-up was 12.9 months .
Figure 3 shows that the benefit of treatment occurred in all performance-status groups .
With a performance status of less than two there were 98 (60%) events in the irinotecan group ,  median duration  of which was 10.5 (range 0.18-9) months .
With a performance status of two there were 24 (92%) events in  the irinotecan group ,  median duration of which was 5.1  (range 0.3-18.5) months .
In the supportive-care group there were 18 (86%) events ,  the median duration of  which was 3.5 (range 1.1-11.0) months .
More patients with a performance-status of worse than 0 at baseline improved their performance status ,   35% versus 11% (p=0.002) .
There  were 61 (73%) events in the irinotecan group ,  median  duration of which was 6.9 (range 0.3-17.2) months .
In the quality-of-life analysis ,  compliance of patients was about 80% in both groups at the beginning of study  and decreased during the study to about 50% .
Compliance decreased more rapidly in the supportive-care group ,  probably due to earlier deterioration in the  patients .
The diarrhoea score was significantly better in the supportive-care group (p=0.02) .
Diarrhoea score was  significantly lower in the supportive-care group .
Table 4 shows the incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events (drug related or not) by patient .
Two (1.1%) of 183 patients treated with irinotecan died of drug-related causes although , in one ,  the association with adverse events (diarrhoea and/or febrile neutropenia) has not been clearly established .
This benefit was clinically meaningful because  the probability of surviving 1 year was 2.6 times greater in patients given irinotecan compared with that of patients given supportive care alone .
More generally ,  the multivariate regression showed that the difference in survival between the two groups remained significant even after adjusting for the  effect of well-known prognostic factors .
The incidence of treatment-related grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea  with irinotecan (21%) was lower than that reported in previous studies (39%) .
