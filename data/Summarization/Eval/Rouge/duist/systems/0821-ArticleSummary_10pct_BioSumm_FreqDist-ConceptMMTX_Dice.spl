Patients eligible for this study had measurable or evaluable advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck , adenocarcinoma of the colon ,  rectum or stomach ,  or SCC of other primary site (Table I) .
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. leukocyte count >3.0 x 10/L ,  platelet count > 100 x 10/L and adequate renal function (scrum creatinine <90 umol/L or creatinine clearance > 1.0 mL/sec) were required .
Patients received oral or IV bicarbonate to ensure a urine pH of at least 7.0 at the time of MTX administration and for 24 hours thereafter ,  then oral folinic acid rescue (FAR) for eight doses of 15 mg each 6 hours commencing 24 hours after the MTX .
Statistical analysis used BMDP statistical software to prepare and compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves (program BMDPIL) for the group as a whole and for subgroups by primary site ,  treatment sequence ,  performance status ,  sex ,  age group ,  and response to therapy .
Variables included in the Cox models for all patients with head and neck cancer were treatment group ,  prior radiotherapy ,  performance status ,  sex ,  and prior surgery .
Four patients ,  two on each treatment sequence ,  died of treatment-related complications (sepsis in two patients ,  diarrhea in one ,  and aspiration pneumonia in one patient) ,  and a further patient developed prolonged neurologic toxicity with coma but recovered fully .
Cox model multivariate analysis showed that ECOG performance status at study entry was the most significant prognostic factor for survival duration (P < .001) ,  and that ,  among the 70 patients with head and neck cancer ,  when allowance was made for performance status ,  a survival difference in favor of the "reverse" FM sequence emerged (P < .025) .
Other factors including stage ,  sex ,  prior radiotherapy ,  and prior surgery were not significant .
Biochemical and cell culture results from this laboratory suggested that the sequence-dependent synergy observed in vitro between MTX and 5-FU was reduced in the presence of 1-3 )umol/L hypoxanthine ,  a physiologic level found in human plasma .
