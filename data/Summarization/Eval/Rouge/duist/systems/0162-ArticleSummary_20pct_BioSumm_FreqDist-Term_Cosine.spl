SINCE JUNE 1973 ,  the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of CMF (cyclophosphamide ,  methotrexate ,  and fluorouracil) chemotherapy were evaluated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes .
After radical mastectomy ,  eligible patients were prospectively randomized to receive either no further treatment or 12 monthly cycles of adjuvant CMF .
The 7-yr results of this first program are now available , 6 and they confirm the benefit of CMFtreated patients (RFS 49.2%) as compared to women subjected to radical mastectomy alone (RFS 35.8% ,  p < 0.002) .
Within 4 wk from surgery ,  patients with TI-3a breast cancer ,  histologically positive axillary nodes ,  age < 70 yr ,  and living fairly close to the Institute were allocated to receive either 12 or 6 cycles of CMF .
Based on the 3-yr analysis of our first CMF study showing an apparent lack of therapeutic advantage following adjuvant chemotherapy in postmenopausal women ,  randomization for this group of patients was discontinued at the end of November 1976 .
Therefore ,  all postmenopausal patients were allocated to receive 12 CMF cycles between December 1976 and March 1977 when accrual for postmenopausal patients was definitely discontinued .
A total of 18 patients older than 65 yr (CMF 12 ,  12 ,  CMF 6 ,  6) were started on low-dose CMF (MTX 30 mg/sq m ,  FU 400 mg/sq m) .
The following systemic treatment was mainly utilized ,  patients in whom estrogen receptors were positive were subjected to hormonal manipulations (ovariectomy in premenopausal women and additive hormonal therapy ,  particularly tamoxifen ,  in postmenopausal patients) ,  combined sometimes with chemotherapy .
In fact ,  the retrospective evaluation of roentgenograms revealed the presence of distant metastases prior to radical mastectomy in 3 patients (CMF 12 ,  1 ,  CMF 6 ,  2) ,  while 4 additional women (CMF 12 ,  3 ,  CMF 6 ,  1) had fixation of the primary tumor to the underlying pectoral fascia or muscle (T3b) .
Therefore ,  a total of 459 patients were found evaluable for treatment comparison ,  i.e. ,  243 women (premenopausal 160 ,  postmenopausal 83) allocated in the 12-cycle group and 216 (premenopausal 164 ,  postmenopausal 52) in the 6-cycle group ,  respectively .
A total of 22 patients (premenopausal 12/324 or 4% ,  postmenopausal 9/135 or 7%) refused to complete the planned adjuvant program mainly because of negative psychologic reasons .
This was especially observed in women planned to receive 12 CMF cycles (18 of 243 or 7%) compared to those entered into the 6-cycle regimen (4 of 216 or 2%) .
Primary treatment failure was defined as the first documented evidence of new disease manifestation(s) in either local-regional area(s) ,  distant site(s) ,  or a combination of the two .
Figure 1 shows that the comparative RFS at 5 yr was practically identical in the two treatment groups (CMF 12 ,  59% ,  CMF 6 ,  65.6% ,  p =0.17) .
It is important to emphasize that overall no RFS difference was documented between preand postmenopausal patients (CMF 12 ,  59.3% versus 57.6% ,  CMF 6 ,  66.5% versus 63.1% , respectively) .
However ,  in spite of the fact that frequency of objective remission was superimposable (-30%) in both ER groups regardless of treatment administered and site(s) of first involvement ,  the disease in ER + tumors had amore indolent course ,  while ER - tumors showed further progression within a few months .
Table 4 shows that also in this series there was evidence of a dose-response effect ,  regardless of menopausal and nodal status (CMF 12 ,  level I 68.9% versus level 11147.2% ,  p < 0.05 ,  CMF 6 ,  level I 66.6% versus level III 51.5% ,  p = 0.10) .
Only a small subgroup of 22 patients (4.8%) refused to complete the planned program ,  and this was essentially due to negative psychologic reasons since these patients objected to being on a heavy and toxic treatment program (drug injections and timing of follow-up) without having visible disease .
As already reported (Table 2) ,  contralateral breast cancer was documented in a total of 11 patients (CMF 12 ,  6 ,  CMF 6 ,  5) .
In one patient of the 6-cycle group ,  endometrial carcinoma in situ was documented within 16 mo from mastectomy ,  3 patients in the 12-cycle group developed endometrial carcinoma ,  thyroid cancer ,  and myoblastoma ,  respectively ,  and in all patients second neoplasms were diagnosed between 46 and 49 mo from mastectomy .
The 5-yr results of the present study are now sufficiently mature to indicate with confidence that 6 cycles of CMF are equivalent to 12 cycles in terms of RFS and total survival .
The observation that in some patient subsets 6 cycles of CMF yielded apparently superior results to 12 cycles is probably related to the relative number of patients in each group and to the different median follow-up in postmenopausal women  whose accrual was discontinued in December 1976 .
Thus ,  all above reported findings strongly support our preliminary 3-yr results and indicate that utilizing a single multidrug regimen ,  it is possible to reduce the duration of adjuvant treatment in operable breast cancer without compromising the therapeutic results .
In this trial ,  patients with > 4 positive axillary nodes or with a positive node in the highest axillary zone were randomized to receive cyclophosphamide and adriamycin for 5 courses (15 wk) or the same regimen given for 10 courses (30 wk) .
It appears evident that ,  (A) the two series given 12 cycles of CMF achieved the same results ,  (B) the data reported in the three series treated with CMF are almost equivalent ,  (C) adjuvant CMF ,  whether administered for 12 or 6 cycles ,  was able to alter the course of operable breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes compared to the group subjected to radical mastectomy alone .
The first and most important one is that there appears to be no real difference following adjuvant chemotherapy ,  namely CMF ,  between the RFS of pre- versus postmenopausal women (CMF 12 ,  59.3% versus 57.6% ,  CMF 6 ,  66.5% versus 63.1% ,  respectively) .
We had previously reported4 that the different results observed in our first adjuvant program were probably due to the low-dose CMF started in 31 of 104 postmenopausal patients (30%) because of elderly age .
The findings supporting evidence of a therapeutic efficacy of adjuvant combination chemotherapy in postmenopausal patients can also be found in the results reported by other investigators who have never observed that menopausal status affected treatment outcome .
More recently ,  the Guy's Hospital and Manchester study groups reported the actuarial 5-yr RFS of a randomized study comparing radical mastectomy alone versus melphalan versus CMF and showed that the only group significantly improved by adjuvant CMF was that of postmenopausal women ,  while premenopausal patients had findings that were superimposable in all three treatment groups .
The results obtained in our series between ER + and ER - tumors ,  coupled with the overall findings observed in the two menopausal groups ,  further contribute to minimize the possible therapeutic role of chemotherapy-induced adjuvant castration in premenopausal women .
Patterns of first treatment failure were not different in the two series and ,  regardless of treatment instituted upon relapse ,  frequency of objective remissions were similar between the two groups followed by short-lived remissions in ER - tumors ,  while ER + tumors tended to show slow growing disease .
Based on our current findings ,  i.e. ,  therapeutic efficacy of adjuvant CMF regardless of ER status ,  there seems to be no clinical reason to withhold the administration of adjuvant combination chemotherapy in node positive women even in the presence of ER + tumors .
Through the analysis of our results in advanced breast cancer treated with CMF ,  Skipper came to the conclusion that in clinically metastatic disease the nadir in surviving tumor cells is probably reached in the majority of patients in less than 6 cycles .
In fact ,  although both frequency and intensity of acute toxicity from adjuvant therapy such as CMF are moderate ,  patients can be spared unnecessary side effects ,  including negative psychologic reactions ,  if treatment duration is rendered more tolerable .
Only long-term analysis will answer the questions of whether the addition of adjuvant hormone therapy to chemotherapy will improve the results in ER + tumors and whether the excellent results reported by the M D Anderson Hospital with FAC (fluorouracil ,  adriamycin ,  cyclophosphamide) in women with > 4 axillary nodes 7 will be reproducible .
