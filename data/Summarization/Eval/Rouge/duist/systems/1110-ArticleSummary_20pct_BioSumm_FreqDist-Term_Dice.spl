In the United States ,  cervical cancer disproportionately affects women who are members of minority groups and women of low socioeconomic status ,  partly because such women tend to have insufficient access to and knowledge of screening programs for cervical cancer .
In 1990 ,  the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) began a randomized clinical trial to compare the effects on survival of treatment with extended-field radiation and treatment with pelvic radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in patients with cervical cancer .
We enrolled women of all ages who had stages IIB through IVA squamous-cell carcinoma ,  adenocarcinoma ,  or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix according to the staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (Table 1) or stage IB or IIA of one of these cancers with a tumor diameter of at least 5 cm or biopsy-proved metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes .
Women were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria ,  disease outside the pelvic area or spread to para-aortic lymph nodes ,  a prior cancer other than cutaneous basal-cell carcinoma ,  medical contraindications to chemotherapy ,  a rare histologic subtype ,  and prior hysterectomy or transperitoneal staging procedure for cervical cancer ,  pelvic radiotherapy ,  or systemic chemotherapy .
Patients who completed the pretreatment evaluation and met all eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to receive extended field radiotherapy or radiotherapy to the pelvic region with concurrent treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil .
The patients in each treatment group were stratified according to the tumor stage (IB ,  IIA ,  or IIB vs. III or IVA) and the staging method used for para-aortic lymph nodes (clinical vs. surgical) .
For patients who were assigned to receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy ,  the treatment field extended from the space between L4 and L5 to the midpubis or to a line 4 cm below the most distal vaginal or cervical site of disease .
Custom shielding was designed to treat the pelvic lymph nodes ,  with a margin of at least 1 to 1.5 cm. For patients who were assigned to receive radiotherapy alone ,  the pelvic and paraaortic areas were treated as a continuous area ,  with a superiorfield border at the space between L1 and L2 .
Brachytherapy was performed within two weeks (preferably less than one week) after the completion of pelvic radiation ,  with the goal of keeping the total duration of treatment under eight weeks when possible .
The protocol specified that all patients receive a total cumulative dose to point A (a reference location 2 cm lateral and 2 cmsuperior to the cervical os) of at least 85 Gy .
Within 16 hours after the first radiation fraction was administered ,  patients in the combination-therapy group received the first cycle of chemotherapy ,  which consisted of an intravenous infusion of 75 mg of cisplatin per square meter of body-surface area over a 4-hour period followed by an intravenous infusion of 4000 mg of fluorouracil per square meter over a 96-hour period .
Toxicity was assessed at the time of each evaluation with use of the Cooperative Group Common Toxicity Criteria ,  the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria ,  and the Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme of the RTOG and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer .
Radiotherapy records ,  including data concerning external-beam fields ,  intracavitary placement ,  doses of radiation to tumor and normal tissues ,  and other treatment variables ,  were reviewed by a radiation oncologist .
Variations were scored as minor ,  major but acceptable ,  or major and unacceptable ,  if they differed by more than 5 ,  10 ,  or 20 percent ,  respectively ,  from the specified dose of radiation or duration of treatment .
Disease- free survival was also compared in the two groups and was calculated from the date of study entry to the date of the first occurrence of disease progression ,  a second diagnosis of cancer ,  or death from any cause ,  or if none of these events occurred ,  to the date of the last follow-up visit .
Five-year rates of secondary end points such as locoregional recurrence ,  para-aortic recurrence ,  and distant metastasis were estimated with the use of cumulative-incidence methods , and treatment effects were tested with use of the Gray algorithm .
On the basis of the results of two earlier RTOG trials ,  we predicted that the five-year survival rate for the control group (radiotherapy alone) would be 65 percent for patients with stage IB or II disease and 40 percent for patients with stage III or IVA disease .
The nominal significance level required for early reporting was origioriginally set at P=0.005 ,  but we subsequently adopted a more conservative approach ,  because it allowed the number of deaths observed to determine the nominal level required for early reporting .
Fifteen patients (4 percent) — six in the combined-therapy group and nine in the radiotherapy group — were subsequently disqualified because of failure to undergo the required evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (eight patients) ,  the presence of extrapelvic cancer (two) ,  the presence of a rare histologic subtype (one) ,  the presence of a stage IB1 tumor with no involvement of pelvic nodes (one) ,  the absence of pretreatment data (two) ,  and receipt of chemotherapy before radiotherapy (one) .
Although moderate (grade 3) and severe (grade 4) side effects occurred more frequently during or within 60 days after the completion of treatment with combined therapy than with radiotherapy alone ,  these effects were usually self-limited or resolved with medical management (Table 3) .
Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that overall survival rates were significantly better among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy than among those treated with radiotherapy alone (73 percent vs. 58 percent ,  P=0.004) (Table 5 and Fig. 1) .
The rates of distant relapse were 14 percent in the combined-therapy group and 33 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) ,  with a relative risk of relapse of 0.39 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.24 to 0.63) in the combined-therapy group .
The rate of locoregional recurrences was 19 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 35 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) ,  with a relative risk of locoregional recurrences of 0.47 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.31 to 0.71) in the combined-therapy group .
There was no significant difference in overall survival between treatment groups among patients who had stage III or IVA disease ,  although  the study was not designed to have a sufficient number of patients in these subgroups to test for a statistically significant difference .
Although the group reported significant improvements in overall and disease-free survival with the addition of hydroxyurea therapy ,  the study has been criticized for the use of a low dose of radiation and the poor survival rates in both groups and because more than half of the 190 patients who were enrolled could not be evaluated .
Despite these criticisms ,  the resultsof that study and those of trials assessing concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy for other tumors stimulated studies of the effects of radiotherapy and various combinations of fluorouracil ,  cisplatin ,  mitomycin ,  carboplatin ,  and paclitaxel as treatments for locally advanced cervical cancer.The results of these trials have been encouraging ,  but mostclinicians have not found them sufficiently  convincing to justify the inclusion of chemotherapy in the routine treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer .
We used a higher dose of cisplatin (75 mg per square meter) than that used with fluorouracil in the Gynecologic Oncology Group studies ,  and we also included a third cycle of chemotherapy during one of the intracavitary procedures .
The importance of this third cycle is uncertain ,  but because close to 25 percentof the total paracentral dose of radiation is delivered with each intracavitary procedure ,  the addition of concurrent chemotherapy during this time may be important .
In our study ,  the benefit of para-aortic radiation may have been less than that observed in an earlier RTOG trial ,  because our trial required more rigorous staging of para-aortic lymph nodes and included patients with more advanced pelvic disease .
