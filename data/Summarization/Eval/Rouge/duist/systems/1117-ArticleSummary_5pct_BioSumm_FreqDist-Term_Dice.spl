We used the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) clinical staging system to classify the stage of cancer.7 If there was disagreement about the stage ,  the case was assigned to the earlier stage. 468 patients had FIGO stage Ib or IIa disease. 343 of these patients were enrolled after they had given their informed consent to take part .
Eligibility criteria were ,  age 30–70 years ,  newly diagnosed stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  no concurrent or previous malignant disease ,  WHO performance status of 1 or less ,  and feasibility of both radical surgery and radiotherapy .
We classified complications as ,  grade 1 ,  mild symptoms not affecting the patient’s health and easily cured ,  grade 2 ,  symptoms that can be resolved by long-term medical therapies ,  grade 3 ,  major symptoms that require surgery or invasive procedures and affect the performance status of the patient ,  or fatal complications .
Of the 468 patients with FIGO stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  125 were excluded because of age (<30 years ,  >70 years ,  n=43) ,  medical illness (n=54) ,  previous or concurrent malignant disease (n=21) ,  or the referring physician’s or patient’s preference for surgery ,  radiotherapy ,  or chemoradiotherapy (n=7) .
Adjuvant radiotherapy was done in 62 (54%) of the 114 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter of 4 cm or smaller and in 46 (84%) of 55 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm. 19 patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or less and three patients whose cervical diameter was greater than 4 cm had lymph-vascular-space involvement as the only pathological risk factor ,  these patients did not receive postoperative irradiation .
The overall and disease-free actuarial 5-year survival for all patients were 83% and 74% ,  respectively ,  and did not differ significantly between the groups (figure 2). 5-year actuarial survival stratified by cervical diameter was similar in the surgery and radiotherapy groups (diameter < 4 cm ,  87% vs 90% ,  diameter >4 cm ,  70% vs 72% ,  figure 3 ,  table 3). 5-year actuarial disease-free survival for the surgery and radiotherapy groups was 80% and 82% ,  respectively ,  for patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or smaller ,  and 63% and 57% for those with a diameter larger than 4 cm ,  the between group differences were not significant .
Of the 86 patients who developed a recurrence ,  50 (58%) had local or pelvic recurrence (22 [52%] in the surgery group vs 28 [64%] in the radiotherapy group ,  p=0·42) ,  and 36 (42%) had distant metastases (20 [48%] vs 16 [36%] ,  p=0·62) ,  five of these 36 patients also had a pelvic recurrence .
Complications were classified according to the glossary of Chassagne and colleagues.10 In the surgery group ,  48 (28%) patients showed severe (grade 2–3) morbidity that required medical or surgical treatment ,  compared with 19 (12%) patients in the radiotherapy group ,  (p=0·0004 ,  table 3) .
