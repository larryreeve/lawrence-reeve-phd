Women with early cervical cancer can be successfully treated with radical surgery .
Those with a large cervical lesion at presentation or with spread to the pelvic lymph nodes or other pelvic tissues are usually treated with a combination of external-beam and intracavitary radiation .
A previous study reported improved survival among women with locally advanced cervical cancer who received prophylactic radiation to the para-aortic nodes .
METHODS .
Women with a Karnofsky performance score of at least 60 and blood counts and serum levels of blood urea nitrogen ,  creatinine ,  and bilirubin that were within normal ranges were eligible for the study .
Women were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria ,  disease outside the pelvic area or spread to para-aortic lymph nodes ,  a prior cancer other than cutaneous basal-cell carcinoma ,  medical contraindications to chemotherapy ,  a rare histologic subtype ,  and prior hysterectomy or transperitoneal staging procedure for cervical cancer ,  pelvic radiotherapy ,  or systemic chemotherapy .
Patients who completed the pretreatment evaluation and met all eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to receive extended field radiotherapy or radiotherapy to the pelvic region with concurrent treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil .
Treatment .
Lateral fields were designed to encompass S3 posteriorly ,  with a margin of at least 3 cm from the primary cervical tumor .
The first intracavitary treatment was performed before or during external-beam radiotherapy ,  and additional external-beam therapy was delivered with a midline block .
Two additional cycles of chemotherapy were scheduled at three-week intervals .
Disease status and the degree of treatment-related toxic effects were assessed by history taking ,  physical examination ,  and appropriate laboratory and radiologic tests .
Toxicity was assessed at the time of each evaluation with use of the Cooperative Group Common Toxicity Criteria ,  the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria ,  and the Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme of the RTOG and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer .
All chemotherapy records were reviewed by a gynecologic oncologist to assess compliance with the protocol .
Death from any cause was considered a failure in the analysis .
We estimated that 199 women would have died by the time of the initial analysis of treatment .
The characteristics of the two treatment groups are summarized in Table 2 .
The median total duration of radiation was 58 days ,  with a mean dose of 89 Gy delivered to point A in each group .
Four patients refused or were unable to receive ny chemotherapy but were included in the analysis according to the intention to treat .
Side Effects .
There were no significant differences in the seriousness of late effects between the treatment groups .
In addition ,  13 patients in the combined-therapy group and 32 patients in the radiotherapy group were alive  but had recurrent cervical cancer .
The estimated five-year survival rates according to various stratification variables are summarized in Table 5 .
The inclusion of chemotherapy substantially reduced both local and distant recurrences of cervical cancer ,  leading to higher overall and disease-free survival rates .
The Gynecologic Oncology Group has also studied the effect of radiotherapy in combination with either hydroxyurea or placebo in women with stage IIIB or IVA disease .
Our protocol emphasized the importance of delivering a radiation dose of atleast 85 Gy to point A within eight weeks whenever possible .
Weekly or daily infusions of cisplatin are well tolerated .
For patients who were receiving postoperative radiation for rectal cancer ,  a prolonged ,  continuous infusion of fluorouracil with pelvic radiation was found to be more effective than short infusions .
The acute side effects were severe ,  possibly because of the addition of chemotherapy or the altered regimen of fractionation .
