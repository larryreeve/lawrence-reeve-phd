The same postradiation regimen of 5-FU and MeCCNU as that used in GI 7175 was chosen for one arm ,  with the exception that the duration of treatment with postradiation 5-FU and MeCCNU was reduced from 18 months to 12 months in an attempt to reduce the leukemogenic potential of the MeCCNU .
An escalating single-agent 5-FU regimen incorporating a theoretical maximum-tolerated dose was chosen as the alternative treatment option based on clinical evidence suggesting a dose response curve for 5-FU and pilot data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggesting added efficacy of 5-FU when given at higher dose levels .
Dose reductions of 5-FU by 25% were required for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU treatment arm who experienced a leukocyte count nadir of below 2,000/UL during the first 3 weeks .
Repetition of severe marrow depression (leukocyte count < 1,500/UL) or thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 25,000/UL) after dose reduction or persistent leukopenia (leukocyte count < 4,000/UL) or thrombocytopenia (< 100,000/UL) at 10 weeks after the last dose of MeCCNU disqualified a patient from any further treatment with MeCCNU .
Dose reduction criteria for the 5-FU escalating arm included no escalation if leukocyte count nadir was below 2,000/UL but at least 1,000/UL and platelet count nadir between 75,000/UL and 99,999/UL and a 25% reduction in the next course for leukocyte nadir below 1,000/UL and platelet count nadir below 75,000/UL .
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an adjuvant treatment with radiation therapy and escalating 5-FU and to compare it with a combination of 5-FU and MeCCNU .
Between March 1981 and November 1985 ,  210 patients were enrolled in this study ,  101 were randomized to the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen ,  and 109 to the escalating 5-FU arm .
The clinical characteristics were well balanced between the treatment arms ,  with a slightly higher percentage of patients having disease extension into perirectal fat randomized to receive 5-FU and MeCCNU (61%) compared with escalating 5-FU (56%) ,  and a higher percentage of males randomized to escalating 5-FU compared with 5-FU and MeCCNU (63% v 56% , respectively) .
Two patients on each treatment arm received no adjuvant therapy ,  and 16 patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and 18 patients assigned to the escalating 5-FU regimen received no postradiation chemotherapy .
An additional three patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm received no MeCCNU after radiation therapy but continued to receive 5-FU .
As planned in the protocol design ,  patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm were treated for a longer duration than patients who received escalating 5-FU (median ,  11.3 months v 7.5 months ,  respectively) .
Also as planned ,  among patients who received chemotherapy ,  dose intensity of 5-FU was greater on the escalating 5-FU arm versus the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm .
Although patients received a median total dose of 12.4 g/m of 5-FU on the escalating 5-FU arm (25% < the planned level of 16.5g/m) and 13.1 g/m of 5-FU on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm (23% < the planned level of 16.9 g/m) ,  the median monthly dose of 5-FU on the escalating arm was 1.74g/m ,  compared with 1.40 g/m on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm (P < .001) .
Patients randomized to 5-FU and MeCCNU received a median total dose of MeCCNU of.37 g/m2 (25% < the planned level of .49 g/m) ,  and a median of .08 g/m of MeCCNU per 10-week course .
Toxicities experienced by patients on the two arms are comparable ,  53% of patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNUarm (52 of 99) and 50% of those assigned to the escalating 5-FU arm (54 of 107) experienced at least one episode of severe or worse toxicity as defined by the GITSG toxicity scale .
Life-threatening toxicities were reported in six (6%) 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 11 (10%) escalating 5-FU patients .
Leukocyte depression below 1,000/UL accounted for a majority of these episodes (eight patients on the escalating 5-FU arm and three on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm) .
Toxicity resulted in either a temporary or permanent decrease in dose ,  interruption of part of therapy ,  or interruption of all therapy in 62% of 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 53% of escalating 5-FU patients .
Six patients are reported to have experienced severe (three) or life-threatening (three) treatment-related intestinal obstructions ,  two receiving the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen and four on escalating 5-FU (Table 2) .
Disease recurrence has been documented in 48% of eligible patients including 54% (51 of 95) of patient srandomized to receive 5-FU and MeCCNU and 43% (45of 104) of patients randomized to receive escalating 5-FU (Table 3) .
Recurrences involving local sites occurred in 17% of 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 16% of escalating 5-FU patients .
Significantly (P = .05) more recurrences involving distant sites have been documented on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm (40%) compared with the escalating 5-FU arm (26%) .
The probability of 3-year disease-free survival on the two arms is 54% and 68% for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and the escalating 5-FU arm ,  respectively ,  median time to recurrenceis estimated to be 4 years and greater than 4 years ,  respectively (Fig 1) .
After adjustment for these variables ,  the 5-FU and MeCCNU and the escalating 5-FU treatment results remained statistically indistinguishable (P = .30 , two-tailed) .
A secondary analysis of disease-free survival considering all patients randomized regardless of eligibility status resulted in an estimated RR attributed to treatment with 5-FU and MeCCNU and adjusted for important covariates of 1.21 (95% CI ,  .83 to 1.88) .
Similarly ,  when only eligible patients who received post-radiation therapy drug treatment were considered (84 escalating 5-FU and 72 5-FU and MeCCNU patients) ,  no difference in direction or magnitude of the RR estimate was observed (RR = 1.17 ,  95% CI ,  .74 to 1.85) .
Six of the deaths unrelated to disease occurred in patients receiving escalating 5-FU and three in patients receiving 5-FU and MeCCNU .
Kaplan-Meier estimates of 3-year survival probabilities for patients assigned to 5-FU and MeCCNU and escalating 5-FU are 66% and 75% ,  respectively (Fig 2) .
Figure 3 compares the survival prognosis of patients undergoing abdominal-perineal resections and patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to margin of resection (as determined by the pathologist on fresh specimen) of <= 3 cm and greater than 3 cm. Patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to the margin greater than 3 cm experienced improved survival compared with patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to the nearest margin <= 3 cm ,  suggesting that abdominal-perineal resection should be considered when the distal margin for resection with the low anterior route would be <= 3 cm .
As in the disease-free analysis ,  secondary analyses of survival considering either all patients randomized or only patients who received treatment after the completion of radiation therapy ,  resulted in no meaningful change in direction or magnitude of the RR attributed to treatment with the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen (RR = 1.10 ,  95% CI ,  .72 to 1.67 ,  and RR = 1.04 ,  95% CI ,  .65 to 1.67 ,  respectively) .
There were no differences between the radiation and escalating 5-FU arm of GI7180 and the radiation and 5-FU and MeCCNU arm of GI 7175 with respect to survival within any stage (Fig 4) .
The results of this study indicate that treatment after surgical resection of Dukes B2 and C rectal cancer with escalating 5-FU postradiation therapy provides similar survival and recurrence outcomes as a postradiation chemotherapeutic regimen including the leukemogen MeCCNU .
Fewer recurrences involving distant sites occurred on the escalating 5-FU arm compared with the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm ,  further suggesting that MeCCNU is not an essential component of the postradiation chemotherapy treatment .
Results from the previous GITSG study (GI 7175) of adjuvant therapy after surgical resection of Dukes B2 or C rectal cancer demonstrated improved survival and disease-free survival in patients treated with combination radiation therapy and post radiation therapy using 5-FU and MeCCNU when compared with surgery alone ,  and improved disease-free survival for patients treated with this combined modality therapy compared with radiation therapy alone .
The results of the present study confirm the expected survival and disease-free survival probabilities observed in the combination therapy arm of the previous GITSG study ,  while the recent report by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) further demonstrates the advantage of combination radiation therapy and chemotherapy compared with radiation therapy alone in reducing recurrence rates and improving survival .
Although data from the initial rectal cancer adjuvant trial conducted by the National Surgical Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP RO1) suggested improved survival and disease-free survival in patients treated with chemotherapy alone compared with surgery alone ,  that study did not include a combined modality treatment arm .
A recent National Institutes of Health consensus conference on adjuvant therapy for patients with colon and rectal cancer concluded that combined postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy improved local control and survival in stage B2 and C patients with rectal cancer and that treatment with combined modality therapy in these patients is recommended .
