RECURRENCE OF rectal cancer in the pelvis after a complete resection represents a major contributor to morbidity and subsequent mortality .
The results of that study are the focus of this report .
An escalating single-agent 5-FU regimen incorporating a theoretical maximum-tolerated dose was chosen as the alternative treatment option based on clinical evidence suggesting a dose response curve for 5-FU and pilot data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggesting added efficacy of 5-FU when given at higher dose levels .
PATIENTS AND METHODS .
Eligibility and Exclusion Criteria .
Randomization .
Patients considered eligible received a full explanation of the purpose ,  procedures ,  and risks of the study ,  signed a statement of informed consent approved by the local institutional review board ,  and were then randomized by telephoning a central coordinating center .
Radiation Therapy .
Chemotherapy .
5-FU and MeCCNU .
Escalating 5-FU .
Dose Reduction Criteria .
Assessment of Radiation Therapy Quality .
Variations of field placement were also categorized into minor and major clinicaldeviations .
Patient Follow-Up .
Verification that these criteria were followed is unavailable .
Criteria for Recurrence .
Perineal pain ,  if preceded by a pain-free interval ,  was considered indicative of recurrence ,  and time of recurrence was listed as the time of pain onset .
Statistical Considerations .
RESULTS .
Patient Cohort .
The remaining 199 patients (95% of the registered population) are included for survival analysis in the study group to which they were randomized regardless of whether or not protocol treatment was administered .
The longest delay was 82 days in a patient who developed an intestinal fistula after surgery .
All of these patients are included in the analyses .
Patient Characteristics .
None of these differences were statistically significant .
Treatment Administration .
Central review of compliance with radiation therapy confirmed that the majority of patients were treated as per protocol ,  with discrepancies occurring equally in each treatment arm .
No patients were excluded from analysis due to deviations from the radiotherapy protocol .
Toxicity .
Disease Recurrence .
The probability of 3-year disease-free survival on the two arms is 54% and 68% for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and the escalating 5-FU arm ,  respectively ,  median time to recurrenceis estimated to be 4 years and greater than 4 years ,  respectively (Fig 1) .
Mortality .
DISCUSSION .
As expected ,  myelosuppression was the most common toxicity seen in both arms .
Progress has clearly been made in the adjuvant treatment of rectal cancer .
Therefore ,  we conclude that MeCCNU is not an essential component of effective postoperative combined modality treatment of adjuvant rectal cancer and should not be included in future treatment regimens .
