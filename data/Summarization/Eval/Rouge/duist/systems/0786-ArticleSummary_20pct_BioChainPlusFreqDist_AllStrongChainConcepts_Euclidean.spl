RECURRENCE OF rectal cancer in the pelvis after a complete resection represents a major contributor to morbidity and subsequent mortality .
An escalating single-agent 5-FU regimen incorporating a theoretical maximum-tolerated dose was chosen as the alternative treatment option based on clinical evidence suggesting a dose response curve for 5-FU and pilot data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggesting added efficacy of 5-FU when given at higher dose levels .
Eligibility and Exclusion Criteria .
The distal edge of the primary tumor must have been <= 12 cm from the anal verge as measured by sigmoidoscopy with the patient in the knee-chest position .
Patients considered eligible received a full explanation of the purpose ,  procedures ,  and risks of the study ,  signed a statement of informed consent approved by the local institutional review board ,  and were then randomized by telephoning a central coordinating center .
Radiation Therapy .
Supervoltage radiation therapy with the treatment volume to encompass the true and false pelvis was specified by the study protocol .
Parallel-opposed three- or four-field techniques were allowed .
For all other patients ,  inclusion of the perineum in the radiation field was at the discretion of the investigator .
The first course on this treatment arm consisted of intravenous 5-FU 300 mg/m2  ,  days 1 to 5 and 375mg/m ,  days 36 to 40 given in a rapid infusion .
Second and subsequent courses were to be given on the same schedule but with the dose of 5-FU increased to 325 mg/m intravenously ,  days 1 to 5,375 mg/m2 ,  days 36 to 40 ,  and MeCCNU to 130 mg/m orally on day 1 .
One year after study activation ,  treatment duration was decreased to a total of 12 months of treatment due to concerns about the leukemic potential of MeCCNU .
Thomas.Deviations in dose and fractionation of up to 5% were considered satisfactory for protocol compliance .
Deviations greater than 5% but <= 10% were considered minor deviations ,  and deviations greater than 10% were regarded as major deviations .
Variations of field placement were also categorized into minor and major clinicaldeviations .
Evaluations were to consist of pertinent medical history ,  physical examinations ,  peripheral hemogram ,  blood chemistries ,  and chest x-rays at 6 ,  12 ,  and 18 months ,  and then annually .
Disease recurrence required histologic or cytologic documentation with the exception that radiographic techniques could be used to establish the presence of metastases to the lung ,  liver ,  bony structures ,  or brain .
Only the first site of recurrence was reported .
Recurrence status for patients identified as dead of recurrent disease without adequate documentation was determined by group review ,  with the examiners blinded to treatment assignment .
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an adjuvant treatment with radiation therapy and escalating 5-FU and to compare it with a combination of 5-FU and MeCCNU .
A major goal was to assess the contribution of MeCCNU to adjuvant benefit .
The potential for MeCCNU to contribute to a result superior to that obtained with escalating 5-FU can be assessed by examining the lower bound of the 95% confidence intervals of relative risk .
Probability distribution estimates of survival and disease-free survival were performed using the product-limit method of Kaplanand Meier .
The median age of the 199 patients analyzed was 59 years .
None of these differences were statistically significant .
Approximately one third of patients (41 of 104) randomized to the escalating 5-FU arm were escalated to at least one 5-day course of 500 mg/m of 5-FU .
In all ,  16% of patients were found to have clinical deviations .
Dosimetry deviations were limited to 5% of the cases .
The probability of 3-year disease-free survival on the two arms is 54% and 68% for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and the escalating 5-FU arm ,  respectively ,  median time to recurrenceis estimated to be 4 years and greater than 4 years ,  respectively (Fig 1) .
After adjustment for these variables ,  the 5-FU and MeCCNU and the escalating 5-FU treatment results remained statistically indistinguishable (P = .30 , two-tailed) .
Mortality .
A total of 91 deaths have been reported ,  46% (44 of95) on 5-FU and MeCCNU and 45% (47 of 104) on 5-FU .
DISCUSSION .
The risk to the patient ,  however ,  is balanced by the expected survival benefit .
Progress has clearly been made in the adjuvant treatment of rectal cancer .
The protocol-mandated radiotherapy dose (4140 cGy) may be suboptimal .
Therefore ,  we conclude that MeCCNU is not an essential component of effective postoperative combined modality treatment of adjuvant rectal cancer and should not be included in future treatment regimens .
