INTRODUCTION .
In addition to modifications of radiation therapy multiple studies have investigated ,  and are investigating ,  strategies that combine radiation with chemotherapy either as neoadjuvant or concurrent administration .
The results reported for trials of neoadjuvant cisplatin-containing chemotherapy prior to radiation have been disappointing with six randomized trials ,  showing no advantage in local control or survival and possibly some detrimental effect .
Chemotherapy may also ,  as in the neoadjuvant strategy ,  have an independent ,  additive cytotoxic effect .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
The radiation energy to be used was 6 MeV or greater .
Intracavitary irradiation was to be delivered as soon after external beam therapy as possible using a linear source without colpostats ,  usually of cesium-137 .
Statistical Methods and Study Design .
A factorial design was planned to test to what degree observed differences were attributable to either factor .
The ‘‘Lifetest Procedure’’ in SAS UNIX was used to compare survival curves .
Complications .
RESULTS .
Of the 234 patients randomized ,  221 were evaluable .
The number excluded in each stratum were 6 in stratum 1 ,  3 in stratum 2 ,  and 4 in stratum 3 .
Ninety-nine patients were in stratum 1 ,  of which 46 were stage IB/IIA and 53 were stage IIB .
One hundred and five were in stratum 2 ,  of which 38 were stage IIB and 63 stage IIIB .
Only 17 were instratum 3 .
In view of the small number of patients in stratum 3 ,  a detailed breakdown of possible tumor prognostic factors is not shown .
The median tumor size in stratum 2 was 7 cm .
Intracavitary radiation was used in all but 19 of the 221 patients .
Compliance with the planned radiation schedules was good .
The histopathology was not centrally reviewed .
Grade was not stated in 32 of 221 .
Capillary lymphatic space (CLS) involvement was commented on in 146 of 221 (66%) .
CLS involvement was found in 34 of the 146 (23%) .
Compliance with planned chemotherapy administration was good .
Pelvic Control and Survival .
For the purpose of analysis ,  the latter group are considered dead of disease .
There is no significant difference in the overall 5-year disease-free survival between the treatment arms .
Thereis a trend in favor of standard radiation and 5-FU .
Table 4 .
A factorial analysis of the magnitude of the impact of differences in the radiation schedule or the addition of 5-FU on the improvements in pelvic control and disease-free survival in stratum 1 was performed .
Table 1 shows the distribution of identifiable possible prognostic factors by treatment assigned .
There was no apparent increase in late complications associated with the addition of 5-FU .
Seven occurred in the group receiving 5-FU and six in those without 5-FU .
DISCUSSION .
It was anticipated that the magnitude of benefit might vary for each stratum .
Within stratum 2 there was an improvement in pelvic control with the use of 5-FU but the difference was not statistically significant .
However ,  in stratum 1 constituted of patients with stage IB/IIA and those IIB tumors with medial parametrial involvement ,  a significant improvement in both pelvic control and disease-free survival in favor of standard radiation with concurrent 5-FU was observed (Figs. 5 and 6) .
A factorial analysis compared the outcome for all patients treated with concurrent 5-FU compared to those without 5-FU .
A similar analysis compared all those treated with standard radiation to those treated with hyperfractionated irradiation .
Such a benefit was not observed in this study .
