In the irinotecan group ,  patients were given best supportive care and irinotecan 350 mg/m ,  diluted in 250 mL normal saline or dextrose ,  over a 90 min intravenous infusion every 3 weeks  (or 300 mg/m if aged >=70 years or WHO performance status 2 ,  according to previously recognised risk factors for developing  toxicity) .
After discontinuation of treatment in the irinotecan group ,  patients were regularly assessed as in the supportive care group  (tumour status ,  symptoms ,  or side-effects ,  every 3 weeks) until  death or for at least a year .
After  discontinuation of treatment in the irinotecan group ,  patients continued to fill in QLQ-C30 questionnaires every 6 weeks as in  the supportive-care group .
With p=0.05 and power of 0.80 ,  264 patients were  required (176 in the irinotecan group and 88 in the supportive-care group) to show a significant difference in 1-year survival from 20% (supportive care) to 35% (irinotecan) .
These characteristics were similar for both groups except for performance status (more patients having poor performance status in the supportive-care group were assessed by carcinoembryonic antigen only ,  with mean antigen ratios versus reference values of 2.24 and 2.83 ,  respectively .
40 (21%)  patients in the irinotecan group received subsequent  anticancer chemotherapies (31 a fluorouracil regimen ,   nine a drug other than irinotecan) .
17 (19%) patients in the supportive-care  group received chemotherapy within 1 month  of randomisation compared with two (1%) in the  irinotecan group .
The survival probability for this group at  6 months was 72.2% ,  at 9 months 52.6% ,  and at  12 months 36.2% .
In this group the survival probability at 6 months was 54.1% ,  at 9 months 29.1% ,  and at 12 months 13.8% .
Patients in the irinotecan group lived significantly longer than those in the supportive-care  group (p=0.0001) .
The survival  probability for this group at 6 months was 76.3% ,  at  9 months 57.2% ,  and at 12 months 40.1% .
In this group  the survival probability at 6 months was 62.5% ,  at  9 months 33.2% ,  and at 12 months 16.2% .
The survival probability for  this group at 6 months was 46.2% ,  at 9 months 26.9% ,  and at 12 months 15.4% .
In this group  the survival probability at 6 months was 26.5% ,  at 9 months 15.9% ,  and at 12 months 7.9% .
When the  treatment group was included in the model , the survival benefit for the irinotecan group remained significant (p=0.001) .
Pain-free survival in patients without pain at baseline (figure 4) was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the supportive-care group (p=0.003) ,  despite a higher proportion of patients on opioids in the supportive-care group .
The  survival probability for this group at 6 months was 56.8% ,  at 9 months 36.6% ,  and at 12 months 18.8% .
In this group the survival probability at 6 months was 31.5% ,  at 9 months  14.7% ,  and at 12 months 4.9% .
Within 23 weeks of randomisation ,  the rate of patients with opioid  consumption by 3-week blocks ranged from 25% to 34% in the irinotecan group and from 40% to 56% in the  supportive-care group .
Patients on supportive-care alone experienced a high incidence of severe adverse events ,  especially pain and asthenia ,  although significantly more patients in the irinotecan group experienced severe events ,  especially neutropenia ,  nausea ,  vomiting ,  and diarrhoea .
Admission for adverse events  occurred in 136 (72%) of patients in the irinotecan group and 57 (63%) of patients in the supportive-carealone group for a cumulative median of 15 (range 1.168) days and 11 (2.87) days ,  respectively .
