the american joint committee on cancer and the international federation of gynecology and obstetrics define stage ib cervical cancer as invasive cancer that is confined to the cervix with a depth of more than 5 mm and a width of more than 7 mm in patients with large stage ib cervical cancers local control and survival are poorer than in patients with smaller stage i cancers whether treated by surgery or irradiation 
in a previous randomized trial of combined external and intracavitary irradiation alone or followed by extrafascial hysterectomy the gynecologic oncology group found that hysterectomy did not improve survival but it did significantly reduce the rate of relapse in the pelvic region unpublished data 
we elected to test this combination in a phase 3 trial to determine whether concurrent weekly treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy would improve progression free survival and survival in women with large bulky or barrel shaped stage ib cervical cancers 
women of any age with biopsy proved primary squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix of stage ib exophytic or expansile barrel shaped tumors with a minimal diameter of 4 cm were eligible for the study 
inaddition patients could have no radiographic evidence of lymphadenopathy on computed tomographic scanning or lymphangiography and in those with enlarged or suspicious appearing lymph nodes no evidence of cancer on fine needle aspiration or histologic evaluation 
all patients were required to have a gynecologic oncology group performance status of 0 1 2 or 3 equivalent to karnofsky performance scores of 90 or 100 70 or 80 50 or 60 and 30 or 40 respectively and adequate bone marrow renal function and hepatic function 
pelvic radiation was delivered with the four field technique with x ray accelerators of at least 4 mv photons at a distance of at least 100 cm the treatment field was set to extend 3 cm beyond the known extent of disease and to encompass iliac and lower common iliac lymph nodes 
the dose to point a a reference location 2 cm lateral and 2 cm superior to the cervical os was 30 gy for a cumulative dose of 75 gy and the cumulative dose to point b the pelvic wall was 55 gy 
the design called for a final analysis when 56 events recurrences or deaths had occurred in patients receiving the control regimen radiotherapy alone and provided the study with a statistical power of 80 percent with use of the log rank test and a one sided significance level of 0 05 
at the time of this analysis 69 patients in the group receiving the control regimen had had a recurrence of disease and 49 had died 88 percent of the number of deaths needed for a final analysis of survival 
randomization was carried out by a block arrangement the treatment assignments were stratified according to center and to whether para aortic lymph nodes were evaluated surgically with approximately equal numbers of patients assigned to each group 
the first stopping rule was chosen to reject the null hypothesis at the 1 percent level whereas the second was chosen so that the level of rejection for both interim tests was 2 percent 
four were subsequently excluded after a central review by the pathology committee found that the specimen was inadequate for evaluation in the case of one patient the primary lesion had been misidentified in the case of one patient the cell type had been misidentified in the case of one patient and the stage of the tumor had been overestimated in the case of one patient 
more patients in the group given radiotherapy alone refused to undergo the operation nine vs five in the combined therapy group and more patients in this group also had an early recurrence eight vs two 
there were no treatment related deaths but 64 patients 35 percent in the combined therapy group had grade 3 moderate or grade 4 severe adverse effects as compared with 25 patients 13 percent in the group given radiotherapy alone 
grade 3 hematologic toxicity was defined as a total white cell count of less than 2000 per cubic millimeter and grade 4 as a total white cell count of less than 1000 per cubic millimeter 
forty nine of the patients in the group given radiotherapy alone died of cervical cancer 26 percent as compared with 27 of the patients in the group given radiotherapy and cisplatin 15 percent table 4 
the treatment of women with bulky stage ib cervical cancers has historically been only partially satisfactory with survival rates of 70 to 75 percent substantially below the rates of 88 to 92 percent expected with smaller stage ib cancers 
the recognition in some centers that patients with bulky stage ib cancers had higher rates of recurrent disease within the cervical area led to the inclusion of adjuvant extrafascial hysterectomy in the treatment regimen for these women 
in 1992 when the current study was initiated complete data on survival in the earlier trial were not available but an early analysis showed a significantly lower rate of relapses in the pelvic region among women who underwent hysterectomy 
the effect of these two drugs in combination with radiotherapy was compared with the effect of hydroxyurea and radiotherapy in a randomized phase 3 trial by the gynecologic oncology group involving patients with cervical cancer of stages iib through iva unpublished data 
they compared treatment with radiation and hydroxyurea treatment with radiation and weekly cisplatin and treatment with radiation and hydroxyurea cisplatin and fluorouracil and found that the rate of relapse free survival was significantly higher in both regimens containing cisplatin 
the radiation therapy oncology group study whose results appear elsewhere in this issue of the journal compared pelvic and para aortic radiotherapy with pelvic radiotherapy in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil in patients with clinical stage ib through iva cervical cancer 
the southwest oncology group study compared pelvic radiotherapy alone with pelvic radiotherapy in combination with fluorouracil and cisplatin in high risk patients with involvement of lymph nodes or surgical margins who had undergone radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer stage ia2 ib or iia unpublished data 
in the earlier gynecologic oncology group study that assessed the value of extrafascial hysterectomy after radiotherapy surgery was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of relapses in the pelvic region but the overall risk of recurrence was not significantly reduced relative risk 0 76 95 percent confidence interval 0 52 to 1 12 and there was no significant difference in survival relative risk of death 0 91 
it is reasonable to conclude on the basis of these results and our results that the elimination of hysterectomy from both regimens would not have affected the increase in survival associated with the use of cisplatin 
the five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment but they share a common result all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin 
this remarkable consistency offers a compelling reason to consider cisplatin therapy in combination with radiotherapy as a new standard of care for patients with bulky stage ib stage iib through iva and high risk cervical cancers
