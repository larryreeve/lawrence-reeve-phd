Patients also needed to have adequate medullary reserve (WBC Å½ 4,000/IpL ,  platelet count >  100,000/p.L) and normal renal (BUN < 8.9 mmol/L ,  creatinine < 130 Rimol/L ,  creatinine clearance > 1.17 mL/s) and liver  (alkaline phosphatase < 110 U/L ,  bilirubin < 21 pimol/L) function .
Staging evaluation included a complete medical history and  physical examination ,  cystoscopy ,  chest x-ray ,  bipedal lymphangiogram ,  intravenous (IV) pyelogram ,  complete blood counts ,  and  biochemistries .
The radiation therapy was administered using an  isocentric technique via a pair of parallel opposed anterior and posterior ports .
The superior limit of the radiation field  was the L5-S1 junction ,  the lower limit wasthe caudal pole of obturator foramen ,  and the lateral boundaries were 1.5 cm  beyond the lymph nodes as demonstrated on lymphangiography .
Chemotherapy consisted of bleomycin 15 U intramuscularly (IM) every 12 hours from days 1 to 4 (total dose ,  120 U) ,   vincristine 1 mg/m2 IV on day 1 ,  mitomycin 10 mg/im 2 IV on day 1 ,  and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1 ,  given on an outpatient  basis every 3 weeks for three cycles .
Six months after activation of the study ,  after nine patients had been treated with CT ,  the bleomycin dose was reduced to 15  U IM every 12 hours from day 1 to day 3 (total dose ,  90 U) ,  and after the first year ,  cisplatin administration was changed  from day 1 to day 4 .
Although not a requirement of the  study ,  attempts were made to keep the hemoglobin level > 120 g/L during pelvic irradiation .
Patients were stratified by  age (< 50 years v > 50 years) ,  extensiveness of parametrial involvement (unilateral v bilateral) ,  and lymphangiogram nodal  findings (negative v positive) .
The study was closed earlier because an interim analysis showed that ,  apart from increased serious toxicity ,  survival was  significantly worse in the combined approach group ,  and we did not feel that a positive result could be obtained with a  larger sample .
The median follow-up time for the RT arm is 51 months (range ,  34 to 67) and is 44 months  (range ,  35 to 65) for the CT + RT .
Seven patients were not included in response assessment in the combined modality group ,  four patients who died  of CT complications ,  two who died of metastatic disease ,  all of them before commencement of RT ,  and one other patient whosepelvic disease progressed during CT and who received palliative irradiation only because of poor general condition .
Late complications are shown in Table 7 and consisted of proctitis ,  cystitis ,  fistula ,  and vaginal stenosis .
All responding  patients experienced major symptomatic improvement .
Alberts et a119 studied the use of BOMP chemotherapy in 14 previously  treated patients with advanced (stage IVB) and/or recurrent disease and reported a 29% CR rate .
Because of the high CR rate and low toxicity ,  both groups felt that  this combination should be used as a front-line treatment of advanced carcinoma of the cervix .
The rationale for the use of neoadjuvant CT23 is that (1) the blood supply to the tumor is not compromised by previous  radiotherapy or surgery allowing for better drug distribution into the tumor ,  (2) patients' tolerance to CT may be enhanced  as performance status and marrow reserve are unaltered by previous treatment ,  (3) decreasing the bulkiness of the primary  disease would improve the effectiveness of the local RT ,  (4) there is the possibility of eradication of subclinical  metastases ,  and (5) theoretically a tumor may be more chemosensitive before surgery or RT .
Although 25.5% of the patients achieved a CR following three cycles of BOMP and 47% of the CT + RT group obtained a CR at the  end of RT ,  the 5-year overall survival was significantly inferior in the CT + RT group than in the control arm (39% v 21% ,  P  = .02) .
Furthermore ,  even if we exclude the patients who experienced  treatment-related death ,  the survival in the BOMP group remains significantly inferior (39% v 25%) .
Withers et a1 have suggested  that the accelerated repopulationlate in the treatment involves only a small number of surviving cells ,  and rapid  repopulation would not be detectable as a change in volume of the total tumor mass .
Thus ,  a PR or even a CR could therefore  be of questionable value in determining therapeutic effectiveness ,  as tumor masses would be still regressing while the  subclinical clonogenic cell repopulation is accelerating .
The mechanisms responsible for such cross-resistance  remain to be determined ,  but recent studies have shown significant similarity between the cytotoxicity of irradiation and  alkylating agents and that tumor cells may develop mechanisms of resistance capable of decreasing the cytotoxic effects of  some antineoplastic drugs as well as radiation .
It is now clear that response rate is  a poor end point .
Transvaginal parametrial needle biopsy has been used to detect  postirradiation recurrent cancer of the cervix and may also play an important role in defining treatment response .
Recently ,  Chambers et al also reported a high incidence of pulmonary toxicity in patients receiving BOMP CT for gynecologic  squamous cell carcinoma .
These authors treated 23 patients (20 cervical cancer ,  two vulvar ,  one ovarian) and observed the  development of pulmonary toxicity in eight patients (34.5%) ,  with five of them dying a respiratory death while free of  disease .
