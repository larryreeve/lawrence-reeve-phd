Vogl et al and Alberts et al using a combination of bleomycin ,  vincristine ,  mitomycin ,  and cisplatin (BOMP) in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent disease reported high response rates (> 20% of the patients with a complete response [CR]) with acceptable toxicity .
MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient Entry Criteria and Evaluation Between April 1984 and August 1986 ,  107 previously untreated patients with stage III B carcinoma of the cervix were entered on the study .
Patients with lymphangiographic findings of pelvic or paraaortic nodal disease were not excluded .
All patients gave written consent before entry into the trial .
Patient characteristics are outlined in Table 1. Paraaortic radiation was not given ,  even for the patients with positive paraaortic nodes on lymphangiography .
Response Criteria The local response to treatment was evaluated at the time of the intracavitary therapy by a pelvic examination under anesthesia .
Patients in the combined modality group were also assessed for local response at the completion of CT and before the start of RT .
Following completion of irradiation ,  patients were assessed every 2 to 3 months for the first 2 years and every 6 months thereafter .
Distant disease was defined as disease occuring outside the pelvis ,  including paraaortic lymph nodes .
Only supportive palliative treatment was given to relapsing patients ,  and CT was not used as a salvage treatment for the patients in the RT-only arm .
End Points All patients were observed to determine the efficiency of the combined therapy by comparing overall survival ,  rate of local control ,  incidence of distant metastases ,  and toxicity between treatment regimens .
During RT ,  patients were assessed weekly and were questioned about the presence of treatment-related symptoms .
Seven patients were not included in response assessment in the combined modality group: four patients who died of CT complications ,  two who died of metastatic disease ,  all of them before commencement of RT ,  and one other patient whose pelvic disease progressed during CT and who received palliative irradiation only because of poor general condition .
Evaluation of tumor response by pelvic examination following therapy for advanced cervical cancer is a subjective and imprecise method of assessment .
Pelvic disease remains the major site of failure ,  with at least 50% of the patients failing within the irradiated volume .
Toxicity Acute toxicity was pronounced in the combined treatment arm (Table 6) .
About two thirds of patients experienced moderate to severe nausea/vomiting .
Skin hyperpigmentation was observed in half of the treated patients ,  being of severe degree in one third .
Five patients (13%) developed such a complication ,  and four died as a direct result .
In spite of this ,  two further patients experienced a similar complication (two of 18 treated patients) .
The cisplatin treatment day was then changed from day 1 to day 4 but yet another patient developed the same problem (one of 12 treated patients) .
This patient developed a fulminant septicemia ,  and despite intensive surgical and medical treatments died soon after admission to the hospital .
Vogl et al'" treated 16 patients with advanced local and/or metastatic cancer of the uterine cervix .
Except for two patients ,  all others had received previous treatment (CT in two ,  pelvic RT in 11 ,  and major surgery in three) .
Of 13 assessable patients ,  10 achieved PRs ,  with three other patients (23%) obtaining a CR .
All responding patients experienced major symptomatic improvement .
Alberts et a119 studied the use of BOMP chemotherapy in 14 previously treated patients with advanced (stage IVB) and/or recurrent disease and reported a 29% CR rate .
Furthermore ,  even if we exclude the patients who experienced treatment-related death ,  the survival in the BOMP group remains significantly inferior (39% v 25%) .
In this study ,  27% of the patients (14 of 52) in the RT group were called partial responders at the end of irradiation .
The lung toxicity experienced by patients in the CT + RT group is unacceptable .
In this study ,  the incidence of pulmonary toxicity was 13% (five of 39) ,  with four patients dying from this complication .
Recently ,  Chambers et al also reported a high incidence of pulmonary toxicity in patients receiving BOMP CT for gynecologic squamous cell carcinoma .
These authors treated 23 patients (20 cervical cancer ,  two vulvar ,  one ovarian) and observed the development of pulmonary toxicity in eight patients (34.5%) ,  with five of them dying a respiratory death while free of disease .
