Intestinal anastomosis has been successfully performed for more than 150 years using a variety of techniques ,  materials ,  and devices .
Of these ,  the method that has proven successful in most situations and in the hands of most surgeons has been the two-layer anastomosis using interrupted silk sutures for an outer inverted seromuscular layer and a running absorbable suture for a transmural inner layer .
Recently ,  several reports have appeared advocating a single-layer continuous anastomosis using monofilament plastic suture .
Because of these potential advantages ,  we hypothesized that the single-layer technique could be introduced into our surgical teaching program with no increase in anastomotic failure and that it could be performed in less time than the two-layer technique .
METHODS .
Patients requiring anastomosis to the rectum or third or fourth portion of the duodenum were excluded because the single-layer continuous method is awkward when both ends of the bowel cannot be fully mobilized .
Patients were assigned to either the one-or two-layer technique in a prospective ,  randomized fashion .
The study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board ,  which also granted a waiver of consent because both methods were in common use in our institution and had similar results .
All single-layer anastomoses were constructed using a continuous 3.0 polypropylene double-needle suture that began at the mesenteric border (Fig. 1) .
Each stitch was advanced approximately 5 mm. To avoid ischemia of the anastomosis ,  the surgeon had to ensure that only enough pressure was applied to the suture while following to approximate the ends of the bowel and render the anastomosis watertight .
For two-layer anastomoses ,  three packets of 3.0 silk sutures ,  each containing five needled sutures ,  and two packets of 3.0 polyglycolic acid sutures were used .
The Fisher exact test and the Pearson chi-square test were used to analyze categorical data .
Anastomotic leaks ,  intraabdominal abscesses ,  length of time required for anastomosis ,  length of stay ,  and material costs are shown for both groups in Table 2 .
Of the three patients in whom fistulas developed ,  one patient had abdominal carcinomatosis ,  one had diffuse peritonitis from an iatrogenic injury of the cecum that occurred during a radical resection of a gynecologic malignancy ,  and the third patient had been treated with an abbreviated laparotomy for trauma and was undergoing a planned reoperation .
The two-layer interrupted anastomosis has its origins in the early 19th century through the experimental work of Travers and of Lembert ,  who advocated careful approximation of the serosal surfaces of the bowel and devised a method of suturing to accomplish this .
In 1836 ,  Dieffenbach performed the fist successful anastomosis of the small intestine using Lemberts method .
Numerous studies in the literature comparing techniques (e.g. ,  one-layer vs. two-layer ,  hand-sewn vs. stapled ,  and end-to-end vs. end-to-side) have failed to demonstrate a clear superiority of one over another .
The senior authors of this paper (J.M.B. ,  E.E.M.) have used the single-layer technique exclusively for many years and can routinely perform an anastomosis in 8 to 10 minutes .
Although it did not quite reach statistical significance ,  it may be related to an intrinsic difference between the two methods ,  the single-layer anastomosis always has a larger lumen .
Bailey et al have speculated that the continuous single-layer suture ,  which resembles a circular coiled spring ,  may be able to expand and contract depending on intraluminal forces .
