ALTHOUGH much progress has been made in the early detection and control of carcinoma of the cervix since the introduction of  the Papanicolau test ,  it is estimated that about 13,500 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 1990 in  the United States with 6,000 patients dying from the disease .
While surgery and radiotherapy (RT) are equally effective in early-stage disease ,  radiation  therapy has been the primary treatment modality for stage III disease ,  with 5-year survival rates between 30% to 45% being  reported.4-8 Attempts to improve these results ,  including the use of hypoxic cell sensitizers ,  hyperbaric oxygen therapy , '0  and neutron therapy" have met with limited or no success .
Vogl et al and Alberts et al using a combination of bleomycin ,  vincristine ,   mitomycin ,  and cisplatin (BOMP) in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent disease reported high response rates (> 20% of  the patients with a complete response [CR]) with acceptable toxicity .
The use of upfront CT as  initial treatment before pelvic RT would be theoretically advantageous as the vascular supply to the tumor is not  compromised ,  allowing a higher local tissue concentration of drugs ,  thereby improving the effectiveness of CT .
To test this  hypothesis ,  we began in 1984 at the Instituto Nacional de Cancer (Rio de Janeiro ,  Brazil) a prospective randomized trial  comparing neoadjuvant BOMP CT followed by pelvic RT (CT + RT) versus pelvic RT alone in patients with stage IIIB carcinoma of  the cervix .
Eligibility criteria consisted of a histopathologic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma ,  age younger than 70  years with no past history of malignancy ,  the lower third of the vagina free of disease ,  and a performance status greater  than 50% in the Karnofsky scale .
Patients also needed to have adequate medullary reserve (WBC Ž 4,000/IpL ,  platelet count >  100,000/p.L) and normal renal (BUN < 8.9 mmol/L ,  creatinine < 130 Rimol/L ,  creatinine clearance > 1.17 mL/s) and liver  (alkaline phosphatase < 110 U/L ,  bilirubin < 21 pimol/L) function .
Staging evaluation included a complete medical history and  physical examination ,  cystoscopy ,  chest x-ray ,  bipedal lymphangiogram ,  intravenous (IV) pyelogram ,  complete blood counts ,  and  biochemistries .
In  the CT + RT group ,  11 refused further therapy ,  including pelvic RT ,  after only one cycle of CT ,  and two others were found to  have abnormal renal function after randomization and before commencement of treatment .
The superior limit of the radiation field  was the L5-S1 junction ,  the lower limit wasthe caudal pole of obturator foramen ,  and the lateral boundaries were 1.5 cm  beyond the lymph nodes as demonstrated on lymphangiography .
A dose of 40 Gy was routinely prescribed to point A ,  which was located 2 cm superior  to the cervical os (applicator flange) and 2 cm lateral to the central axis of the uterus .
Chemotherapy consisted of bleomycin 15 U intramuscularly (IM) every 12 hours from days 1 to 4 (total dose ,  120 U) ,   vincristine 1 mg/m2 IV on day 1 ,  mitomycin 10 mg/im 2 IV on day 1 ,  and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1 ,  given on an outpatient  basis every 3 weeks for three cycles .
Six months after activation of the study ,  after nine patients had been treated with CT ,  the bleomycin dose was reduced to 15  U IM every 12 hours from day 1 to day 3 (total dose ,  90 U) ,  and after the first year ,  cisplatin administration was changed  from day 1 to day 4 .
A CR was defined as the complete resolution of all  measurable disease and symptoms ,  a partial response (PR) was defined as a 50% or more decrease in the sum of the products of  perpendicular diameters of measurable disease ,  and stable disease (SD) was defined as less than a 50% decrease in the sum of  the products of perpendicular diameters of the measurable lesions .
Late complications were graded as  per the morbidity grading system suggested by Pilepich et al , 2 which takes into consideration the impact of the complication  on the patient performance and/or life-style and the required treatment for such complications (Table 2) .
Patients were stratified by  age (< 50 years v > 50 years) ,  extensiveness of parametrial involvement (unilateral v bilateral) ,  and lymphangiogram nodal  findings (negative v positive) .
We planned to accrue 60 patients into each treatment arm ,  which would produce a power of 80%  and detect an improvement of 25 % in survival with the combined modality treatment at the a = 0.05 level (two-sided test) .
The study was closed earlier because an interim analysis showed that ,  apart from increased serious toxicity ,  survival was  significantly worse in the combined approach group ,  and we did not feel that a positive result could be obtained with a  larger sample .
Seven patients were not included in response assessment in the combined modality group ,  four patients who died  of CT complications ,  two who died of metastatic disease ,  all of them before commencement of RT ,  and one other patient whosepelvic disease progressed during CT and who received palliative irradiation only because of poor general condition .
At the end of therapy ,  or even after several months posttreatment ,  it is difficult to be  certain whether some of the pelvic findings are due to residual tumor or postirradiation fibrosis ,  allowing misinterpretation  of tumor responses .
After two bleomycin-related lung deaths (two of nine treated patients) ,  the  bleomycin dose was reduced from 30 U daily for 4 days to 30 U daily for 3 days .
One patient in the RT group who had grade 3 cystitis ,  characterized by  frequent hematuria ,  presented to the emergency room 19 months following completion of pelvic RT with gross hematuria with  clots .
The rationale for the use of neoadjuvant CT23 is that (1) the blood supply to the tumor is not compromised by previous  radiotherapy or surgery allowing for better drug distribution into the tumor ,  (2) patients' tolerance to CT may be enhanced  as performance status and marrow reserve are unaltered by previous treatment ,  (3) decreasing the bulkiness of the primary  disease would improve the effectiveness of the local RT ,  (4) there is the possibility of eradication of subclinical  metastases ,  and (5) theoretically a tumor may be more chemosensitive before surgery or RT .
Although 25.5% of the patients achieved a CR following three cycles of BOMP and 47% of the CT + RT group obtained a CR at the  end of RT ,  the 5-year overall survival was significantly inferior in the CT + RT group than in the control arm (39% v 21% ,  P  = .02) .
It cannot be accounted for by patient  selection as both groups were well balanced for the wellknown prognostic factors in stage III carcinoma of the cervix.4'24-27  More importantly ,  all patients in the CT + RT arm completed pelvic RT ,  as defined by the protocol guidelines ,  and therefore ,   inadequate irradiation dosage cannot explain the poorer results .
Recently ,  Withers et al28 have shown that clonogen repopulation in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region  accelerates after about 4 + 1 weeks after initiation of radiotherapy .
Since repopulation by surviving tumor clonogens is not  a specific response to RT but rather results from killing of tumor cells ,  these authors have suggested that CT ,  which is  effective in killing cells ,  could also lead to an accelerated regrowth of surviving clonogens ,  lessening the effect of  subsequent RT .
Similarly ,  in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ,  upfront CT has produced impressive response rates ,  but again ,   this has not led to an improvement in survival rates over those achieved with RT alone .
Withers et a1 have suggested  that the accelerated repopulationlate in the treatment involves only a small number of surviving cells ,  and rapid  repopulation would not be detectable as a change in volume of the total tumor mass .
The mechanisms by which this increased cell proliferation occurs  are not entirely clear ,  although ,  as suggested by Tannock , 34 it may result from improved nutrition of surviving cells  following shrinkage of the tumor due to previous therapy .
The mechanisms responsible for such cross-resistance  remain to be determined ,  but recent studies have shown significant similarity between the cytotoxicity of irradiation and  alkylating agents and that tumor cells may develop mechanisms of resistance capable of decreasing the cytotoxic effects of  some antineoplastic drugs as well as radiation .
These authors treated 23 patients (20 cervical cancer ,  two vulvar ,  one ovarian) and observed the  development of pulmonary toxicity in eight patients (34.5%) ,  with five of them dying a respiratory death while free of  disease .
Theuse of concomitant CT (usually  fluorouracil and/or cisplatin) and RT has shown promising therapeutic results in a variety of tumors43-45 and may prove  useful in circumventing the problem of accelerated regrowth of surviving clonogens .
