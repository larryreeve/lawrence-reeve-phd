CERVICAL cancer is the second most frequent cancer among women worldwide and the most frequent cancer among women in Africa ,  Asia ,  and South America .
METHODS .
Eligibility .
The institutions that participated in the study are listed in the Appendix .
Radiotherapy .
For the lateral fields ,  the anterior border was the anterior border of the pubic symphysis and the posterior border was the space between S2 and S3 .
The fields could be modified to include areas of known tumor .
Interstitial and high-dose brachytherapy were not allowed .
Chemotherapy .
Statistical Analysis .
The primary end points were survival and progression-free survival .
All reported P values are two-tailed unless otherwise stated .
The performance of these interim tests raised the type I error by only 0.05 percent .
RESULTS .
Characteristics of the Patients .
The analyses reported here were performed in December 1998 .
Progression-free Survival .
Survival .
The median duration of follow-up was 35 months .
Site of Progression .
Chemotherapy .
Radiotherapy .
Adverse Effects .
There were no treatment-related deaths .
DISCUSSION .
Thus ,  locoregional control must be improved .
Hematologic toxicity was the principal adverse effect in this trial .
Nevertheless ,  there were no significant differences in the length of radiotherapy among the three groups .
In our study ,  the duration of radiotherapy and the dose of radiation were similar among the three regimens , implying that the differences in progression-free survival and survival were related to the chemotherapy .
