SINCE JUNE 1973 ,  the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of CMF (cyclophosphamide ,  methotrexate ,  and fluorouracil) chemotherapy were evaluated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes .
All our progress reports have consistently demonstrated that there was a significant difference in the relapse-free survival (RFS) favoring patients who received adjuvant CMF .
In fact ,  a relative shortterm adjuvant systemic treatment would spare the patients a considerable amount of toxicity .
Within 4 wk from surgery ,  patients with TI-3a breast cancer ,  histologically positive axillary nodes ,  age < 70 yr ,  and living fairly close to the Institute were allocated to receive either 12 or 6 cycles of CMF .
The dose schedule of CMF was as follows ,  cyclophosphamide (CTX) 100 mg/sq m by mouth from day 1 to day 14 ,  methotrexate (MTX) 40 mg/sq m intravenously on days 1 and 8 ,  and fluorouracil (FU) 600 mg/sq m intravenously on days 1 and 8 .
A total of 18 patients older than 65 yr (CMF 12 ,  12 ,  CMF 6 ,  6) were started on low-dose CMF (MTX 30 mg/sq m ,  FU 400 mg/sq m) .
Toxic manifestations other than myelosuppression (e.g. ,  mucositis or cystitis) required temporary dose reduction only if severe .
The following systemic treatment was mainly utilized ,  patients in whom estrogen receptors were positive were subjected to hormonal manipulations (ovariectomy in premenopausal women and additive hormonal therapy ,  particularly tamoxifen ,  in postmenopausal patients) ,  combined sometimes with chemotherapy .
When estrogen receptors were negative or could not be determined ,  systemic treatment consisted of combination chemotherapy utilizing preferentially an adriamycin- containing regimen .
Whenever possible ,  patients who refused second-line cytotoxic chemotherapy were treated utilizing hormonal manipulations according to their age .
In fact ,  the retrospective evaluation of roentgenograms revealed the presence of distant metastases prior to radical mastectomy in 3 patients (CMF 12 ,  1 ,  CMF 6 ,  2) ,  while 4 additional women (CMF 12 ,  3 ,  CMF 6 ,  1) had fixation of the primary tumor to the underlying pectoral fascia or muscle (T3b) .
Prior to mastectomy ,  all patients underwent complete physical examination ,  x-ray of chest and skeleton (skull ,  spine ,  pelvis ,  upper third of femurs) ,  liver scan ,  bilateral mammography ,  hemogram ,  and biochemical tests .
Biochemical tests (serum bilirubin ,  total proteins ,  alkaline phosphatase ,  SGOT and SGPT ,  and LDH) were repeated every 6 mo during the first 3 yr and once a year thereafter .
Primary treatment failure was defined as the first documented evidence of new disease manifestation(s) in either local-regional area(s) ,  distant site(s) ,  or a combination of the two .
However ,  in spite of the fact that frequency of objective remission was superimposable (-30%) in both ER groups regardless of treatment administered and site(s) of first involvement ,  the disease in ER + tumors had amore indolent course ,  while ER - tumors showed further progression within a few months .
Only a small subgroup of 22 patients (4.8%) refused to complete the planned program ,  and this was essentially due to negative psychologic reasons since these patients objected to being on a heavy and toxic treatment program (drug injections and timing of follow-up) without having visible disease .
In one patient of the 6-cycle group ,  endometrial carcinoma in situ was documented within 16 mo from mastectomy ,  3 patients in the 12-cycle group developed endometrial carcinoma ,  thyroid cancer ,  and myoblastoma ,  respectively ,  and in all patients second neoplasms were diagnosed between 46 and 49 mo from mastectomy .
It appears evident that ,  (A) the two series given 12 cycles of CMF achieved the same results ,  (B) the data reported in the three series treated with CMF are almost equivalent ,  (C) adjuvant CMF ,  whether administered for 12 or 6 cycles ,  was able to alter the course of operable breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes compared to the group subjected to radical mastectomy alone .
The first and most important one is that there appears to be no real difference following adjuvant chemotherapy ,  namely CMF ,  between the RFS of pre- versus postmenopausal women (CMF 12 ,  59.3% versus 57.6% ,  CMF 6 ,  66.5% versus 63.1% ,  respectively) .
More recently ,  the Guy's Hospital and Manchester study groups reported the actuarial 5-yr RFS of a randomized study comparing radical mastectomy alone versus melphalan versus CMF and showed that the only group significantly improved by adjuvant CMF was that of postmenopausal women ,  while premenopausal patients had findings that were superimposable in all three treatment groups .
The results obtained in our series between ER + and ER - tumors ,  coupled with the overall findings observed in the two menopausal groups ,  further contribute to minimize the possible therapeutic role of chemotherapy-induced adjuvant castration in premenopausal women .
The fact that premenopausal women with ER + showed a significantlylonger survival than their matches with ER - tumors remains to be further evaluated .
The most important practical aspect of our current study is at which point a single drug combination has provided all the benefit possible ,  i.e. ,  maximal tumor cytoreduction ,  in the majority of patients .
Therefore ,  there are no sound clinical reasons to prolong treatment utilizing the same drugs beyond a 6-mo period .
Also ,  the Arizona group utilizing a different combination regimen ,  i.e. ,  adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide ,  for about 6 mo achieved a 5-yr RFS that is very similar to that observed in ourstudies .
In fact ,  although both frequency and intensity of acute toxicity from adjuvant therapy such as CMF are moderate ,  patients can be spared unnecessary side effects ,  including negative psychologic reactions ,  if treatment duration is rendered more tolerable .
Moreover ,  a less protracted exposure to cytotoxic regimens ,  including alkylating agents and adriamycin ,  could decrease the potential risk of delayed morbidity ,  namely cancerogenesis and chronic organ damage .
Repetitive dose treatments either eradicate all or the vast majority of drug-sensitive neoplastic cells or hold them in check ,  leaving fluctuating and sometimes larger numbers of drug-resistant cells .
This appears to be a basic law that underlies and explains some (not all) important and consistent observations in the area of cancer chemotherapy .
In our optimal kinetic situation ,  cyclic or sequential delivery of equally effective and non-cross-resistant drugs often will prevent or delay failures due to overgrowth of drug-resistant sublines of neoplastic cells ,  as recently demonstrated in advanced Hodgkin's disease .
Our current protocols are testing sequential versus alternating delivery of CMF and adriamycin ,  since our previous experience has demonstrated that both treatments are equally effective and non-cross-resistant .
Furthermore ,  to insure full drug doses in the new protocols ,  we have modified the CMF regimen and all three drugs are administered intravenously every 3 wk (CTX and FU 600 mg/sq m ,  MTX 40 mg/sq m) .
In the presence of myelosuppression(leukocytes < 3800/cu mm and/or platelets < 100,000/cu mm) on day 22 ,  treatment is delayed 1-2 wk to allow a constant delivery of full doses .
The presence of specifically multidrug-resistant phenotypes limits the therapeutic effectiveness of a single combination and renders its prolonged administration unnecessary .
Only long-term analysis will answer the questions of whether the addition of adjuvant hormone therapy to chemotherapy will improve the results in ER + tumors and whether the excellent results reported by the M D Anderson Hospital with FAC (fluorouracil ,  adriamycin ,  cyclophosphamide) in women with > 4 axillary nodes 7 will be reproducible .
