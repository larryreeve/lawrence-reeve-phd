In retrospective studies ,  the incidence of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) was estimated to be approximately 3% to 4% after a cumulative DOX dose of 450 mg/m2 and 6% to 10% after 550 mg/m2 ,  the incidence of CHF rises steeply after higher cumulative doses.On the basis of these retrospective studies ,  an empiric dose limitation of 450 to 550 mg/m2 has been recommended when DOX is used on a standard every three week schedule .
Other criteria for eligibility included a performance status of - 50% (Karnofsky scale) ,  a WBC count - 4,000/14L ,  a platelet count >- 100,000/L ,  normal serum bilirubin levels ( < 1.5 mg/dL) ,  and objectively evaluable or measurable disease .
The additional patient randomized to EPI died with progressive breast cancer and nadir sepsis 15 days after her first dose of EPI ,  she is excluded from analysis of therapeutic results ,  but is included in the analysis of hematologic toxicity .
The difference in cardiac toxicity was manifested by the difference in total cumulative dose at which changes in LVEF occurred (Fig 2A) ,  as well as by the difference in dose at which clinical CHF was seen (EPI ,  1,035 to 1,234 mg/m 2 v DOX ,  456 to 600 mg/m2) .
Although these results could have been affected by the greater incidence of cardiac irradiation inpatients treated with DOX ,  only three patients who had received such radiotherapy actually developed CHF ,  one on the EPI arm and two on the DOX arm .
In the present study ,  each drug was given every three weeks in doses that produced equivalent degrees of myelosuppression ,  a preplanned limitation on the total cumulative dose of EPI was not used .
In contrast ,  the present study predicts an incidence of laboratory cardiotoxicity in excess of 70% for those patients who receive more than 600 mg/m2 of DOX .
Most patients in our trials received less than 550 mg/m2 of EPI ,  however ,  in 11 patients receiving cumulative EPI doses from 550 to 1,465 mg/m2 ,  RNCA abnormalities were observed in only four patients at 970 ,  1,180,1,190 ,  and 1,465 mg/m2 ,  respectively (C.W .
Although at times a decrease in LVEF was observed immediately before the development of CHF ,  we were unable to confirm the previously described pattern of predictable progressive decline in LVEF over time for all patients.6 Many patients maintained their left ventricular function at the baseline value until it worsened abruptly shortly before or at the time that clinical CHF was observed .
The sudden onset of clinical deterioration was also reported byBristow who considered this a manifestation of a nonlinear relationship between myocardial structure and function.3 6 Likewise ,  changes in LVEF in response to stress frequently accompanied a decline in LVEF ,  but we did not observe such a decline without a concommittant change in resting LVEF .
