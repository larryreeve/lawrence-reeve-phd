At the time we were developing the protocol used in the current study ,  radiotherapy plus concomitant chemotherapy with hydroxyurea was the standard combined-therapy regimen for advanced cervical cancer ,  because an early analysis of the combination of radiation ,  cisplatin ,  and fluorouracil failed to show improved progression-free survival .
In a phase 3 trial conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group ,  388 patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy either with cisplatin and fluorouracil or with hydroxyurea (Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) ,  the two-drug regimen improved survival (relative risk of death ,  0.74 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.58 to 0.95) .
