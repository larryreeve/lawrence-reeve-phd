However ,  among patients with a clinically early cancer ,  there are prognostic features which identify patients at increased risk for recurrence ,  recurrent cervical cancer after initial radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy has a poor prognosis ,  with a reported 5-year survival rate of 5% or less .
A retrospective study of patients undergoing radical hysterectomy at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) from 1939 to 1977 identified the following risk factors ,  metastatic tumor to the pelvic lymph nodes ,  large cervical tumor ,  parametrial extension of disease ,  nonsquamous or grade 3 histology ,  and deep (.75%) cervical stromal invasion .
Chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation has been studied in our institution in a prospective Phase II trial ,  with an apparent improvement in survival rates when compared to historical controls .
In an effort to determine whether the improved survival in the Memorial Hospital Phase II trial was due to the combination of chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation therapy or due to the effect of the chemotherapy alone ,  a multicenter randomized Phase III clinical trial was designed .
Patients with clinical Stage IB–IIA cancer of the uterine cervix treated by radical hysterectomy ,  bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy ,  and aortic lymph node sampling were eligible for entry into this prospective study if they had one or more of the following risk factors ,  (1) metastatic disease to pelvic lymph nodes ,  (2) large primary tumors greater than or equal to 4 cm in diameter ,  (3) deeply invasive lesions with 75% or greater stromal invasion ,  (4) nonsquamous histology ,  and/or (5) occult parametrial involvement or positive surgical margins .
Randomization was performed at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center by the Department of Biostatistics using an envelope system .
Patients with recurrent disease were classified by the site of recurrence and the interval from the date of radical hysterectomy to the date of recurrence .
The null hypothesis considered that the two treatment arms ,  chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy plus radiation ,  would both result in 5-year disease-free survival of 70% .
The estimated duration of the trial when it opened in 1987 was 4–5 years .
RESULTS .
Among the 77 patients evaluable for response ,  5 were lost survival curves are presented in Fig. 1 .
Toxicity was tolerable in the two treatment arms .
Monk and colleagues pated toxicity of cisplatin and bleomycin .
However ,  many patients who have these platin held due to persistent grade 3 neutrophil toxicity risk factors are at an increased risk for early ,  subclinical  (grade 3 ? neutrophil count . 1000 cells/mm3) .
The analysis of the data from the 89 patients entered is not able to document that the two treatments are equivalent ,  but must be taken to suggest that the likelihood of finding a significant difference between these two treatment modalities in a full trial of 160 patients is small .
Additionally ,  if the patient does experience a local or regional recurrence after chemotherapy ,  pelvic radiation therapy still has curative potential .
