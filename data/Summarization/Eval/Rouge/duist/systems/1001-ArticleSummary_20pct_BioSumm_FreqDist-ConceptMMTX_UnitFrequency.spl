Purpose ,  As previously shown ,  antibody treatment increased survival of patients with resected colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C .
Since the 5-year analysis was criticized because of the wide range (2.7 to 7.5 years) of follow-up time ,  we performed a 7-year analysis with only four of 189 patients monitored for less than 5 years .
After 7 years of follow-up evaluation ,  treatment had reduced overall mortality by 32% (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P < .01 ,  log-rank ,  P = .01) and decreased the recurrence rate by 23% (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P < .04 ,  log-rank ,  P = .07) .
The intentionto-treat analysis gave a significant effect for overall survival (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P < .01 ,  log-rank ,  P = .02) and disease-free survival (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P = .02 ,  log-rank ,  P = .1 1) .
While distant metastases were significantly reduced (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P = .004 ,  log-rank ,  P = .004) ,  local relapses were not (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P = .65 ,  log-rank ,  P = .52) .
Wondering what the characteristic features of these trials were ,  one notes that two of these trials ,  one in lymphoma and one in breast carcinoma ,  2 had been performed with engineered antibodies ,  ie ,  either human/ murine chimeric or human complementanly defining regious (CDR)-grafted mmunoglobulins respectively ,  while the third stands out because of the target and end point used .
In contrast to other trials aimed at patients with larger metastatic tumor masses and using regression or shrinkage as the end point ,  this one on colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C required microscopically complete resection of the primary tumor for patients to be admitted.3 As the primary end point ,  overall-survival was determined at 5 years .
Here ,  we report on the 7-year follow-up study of this prospective randomized two-arm trial in minimal residual disease that used the murine 17-1A antibody ,  4 which recognizes a 34-kd glycoprotein of the cell membrane of epithelial cells.5 The 5-year analysis had shown that a short ,  albeit intensive ,  postoperative course of antibody treatment (900 mg total dose) significantly reduced the appearance of distant metastases ,  but did not affect the rate of local relapses .
As recently shown for breast carcinoma ,  without regional radiation therapy ,  occult local metastases can give rise to distant metastases after many years and thus affect long-term survival .
The multicenter study consisted of six academic centers in former West Germany A total of 189 patients were randomized ,  with the first patient entered in May 1985 and the last in Apnl 1990 The study was closed in December 1992 ,  and we present here the final status with median follow-up data of 7 years Eligible patients were required to have histologically confirmed adenocarcmoma of colon or the rectum with spread to regional lymph nodes (Dukes' C or International Unimon Agamst Cancer [UICC] stage III) In addition ,  hlstopathologic confirmation of curative resection (R0) was secured Radical tumor resection was performed by a standardized technique agreed upon by all participating centers When located within 15 cm of the anal verge ,  a tumor was classified as rectal carcinoma Patients were less than 70 years old and had a Karnofsky index greater than 50% Eleven of 99 patients randomized to treatment refused their treatment assignment ,  but were otherwise considered eligible for the study .
According to Zelen ,  these patients were included in the treatment group for final analysis ,  although they had not received antibodies .
After confirmation of histology and R0 resection of lymph node metastasis ,  patients were randomized into two groups one received 17-lA treatment ,  whereas the other served as observation controls .
All patients were stratified according to Zelen 8 by the following factors participating center ,  sex ,  location of tumor ,  stage (Dukes' Cl or C2 equivalent to pN1 or pN2-3) ,  number of affected lymph nodes ,  and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level before surgery (Table 1) In the treated arm ,  more patients had pT2 and pT3 tumors ,  and fewer had pT4 tumors However ,  treated patients appeared to have had higher numbers of involved lymph nodes (pN2) and tumors of less differentiated histology (grade 3) .
However ,  a Fishers' exact test ,  companng the distnbutlon of patients according to all prognostic variables ,  showed no significant differences Randomlzation before consent was performed and evaluated according to Zelen 9 On approval by legal experts in 1985 ,  this procedure was accepted by the ethical review board Statistical analyses were performed according to SAS (Statistical Analysis System ,  Cary ,  NC) To test for potential selection bias in the study ,  a retrospective analysis was performed at Medizimnische Hochschule Hannover on 67 Dukes' C colorectal cancer patients selected from 107 patients seen between 1980 and 1985 They fulfilled the entry criteria for the 17-1A clinical trial and were monitored for at least 5 years each The survival analysis was performed by the Instutut fur Medlzinische Informatlk und Blomathematlk ,  Umversltat Essen The overall survival according to Kaplan-Meier curve is nearly identical to the control group of the 17-1A trial (log-rank ,  P = 97) ,  thus ,  this historical control does not show any selection bias .
Some patients have now been monitored for 10 years and only five patients were observed for a period of less than 5 years ,  with a range of 3.5 to 4.5 years .
Thus ,  eight patients had Dukes' B ,  four had Dukes' D ,  three were older than 70 years ,  one presented with polyposis coh ,  and one patient had residual tumor (R2) after surgery .
One patient had a competing neoplasm and one patient received postoperative radiochemotherapy .
However ,  eleven patients who refused their treatment assignment were considered eligible and were included in all statistical analyses as participants in the treatment group .
The KaplanMeier survival curves (Fig 1A) showed a significant benefit for patients who received antibody over those who did not receive treatment (P < .01 with Cox's proportional hazard model corrected for influence of prognostic variables ,  and P = .01 with log-rank test for the univariate analysis) .
Also ,  the intention-to-treat analysis (Fig B) on all 185 patients showed a significant overall benefit for the treated group (P < .01 with Cox's multivariate analysis ,  and P = .02 with log-rank test for the univanate analysis) .
Among all deaths recorded ,  six patients died without recurrence or secondary colorectal cancer and one observed patient of the control group died of secondary colon carcinoma ,  which was not counted as a recurrence .
Antibody treatment increased time to recurrence (P = .04 with Cox proportional hazards model corrected for influence of prognostic variables ,  and P = .07 with log-rank test for umvanate analysis) .
However ,  when death without recurrence was considered an event (recurrence-free survival) ,  again a significant treatment advantage with 17-1A over control was obtained (P = .03 with Cox multivariate ,  and P = .05 with log-rank test for the umvariate analysis) .
When the analyses of recurrence-free interval and recurrence-free survival were performed including all randomized patients ,  ie ,  according to intention-to-treat ,  17-1A treatment again led to significant advantage over the untreated group (Cox multivanate ,  P = .02 ,  log-rank ,  P = .01 ,  respectively) .
Patients who developed recurrences and those who remained tumorfree did not show a difference in antibody titers .
As the 7-year median follow-up data confirm the previously reported 5-year findings ,  the conclusion seems warranted that antibody treatment improves the chances of curatively operated patients .
Local recurrences may not affect the overall survival curve to the same degree as distant metastases do (Fig 3) ,  therefore ,  survival at 7 years appears to be superior to the disease-free interval .
While after 5 years of follow-up evaluation ,  a significant increase in disease-free and overall survival ofpatients was evident ,  after 2 further years ,  the overall survival did not show significance .
However ,  patients with and without manifest metastatic relapses did not differ in antiidiotype titers. 18 To detect ab3 antibodies ,  we applied a sensitive enzyme-linked mmunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) ,  which allowed us to determine human 17-1A autoantibody .
Furthermore ,  humanized antibodies or entirely human antibodies generated from human mmunoglobulin gene hbrarles that are less Immunogenic than murine antibodies are now being tested .
One of these trials ,  performed in Europe and Israel ,  includes a confirmatory arm with antibody as single treatment ,  with the other two arms applying chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus antibody ,  respectively .
