TRIALS of postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer conducted during the 1960s and 1970s showed significant reductions in rates of locoregional recurrence but no improvement in overall survival .
This result has been attributed to micrometastases ,  which determine prognosis regardless of the effect of the locoregional therapy .
Nevertheless ,  there are reasons to reconsider radiotherapy ,  including the limited value of adjuvant chemotherapy for bulky disease ,  a synergistic effect of chemotherapy plus radiation on residual locoregional tumor ,  and the possibility that eliminating bulky disease with radiation may improve the effect of chemotherapy ,  because chemotherapy may be more effective when the overall disease burden is low .
METHODS .
The mastectomy was performed according to standard surgical practice between 1979 and 1986 .
Surgery .
Chemotherapy .
Radiation .
Statistical Analysis .
In all the analyses ,  the data were censored as of the date of that follow-up .
RESULTS .
All Patients .
Study Groups .
Subgroups Based on Nodal Involvement .
Side Effects of Radiation .
There were no cases of brachial plexopathy .
DISCUSSION .
There was no excess mortality we could attribute to the long-term side effects of radiotherapy .
A previous meta-analysis and several individual trials found that the latter was due to a substantial increase in mortality from cardiac causes .
