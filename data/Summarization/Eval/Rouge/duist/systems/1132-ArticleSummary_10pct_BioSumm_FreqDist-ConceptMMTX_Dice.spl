While surgery and radiotherapy (RT) are equally effective in early-stage disease ,  radiation  therapy has been the primary treatment modality for stage III disease ,  with 5-year survival rates between 30% to 45% being  reported.4-8 Attempts to improve these results ,  including the use of hypoxic cell sensitizers ,  hyperbaric oxygen therapy , '0  and neutron therapy" have met with limited or no success .
Vogl et al and Alberts et al using a combination of bleomycin ,  vincristine ,   mitomycin ,  and cisplatin (BOMP) in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent disease reported high response rates (> 20% of  the patients with a complete response [CR]) with acceptable toxicity .
Patients also needed to have adequate medullary reserve (WBC Å½ 4,000/IpL ,  platelet count >  100,000/p.L) and normal renal (BUN < 8.9 mmol/L ,  creatinine < 130 Rimol/L ,  creatinine clearance > 1.17 mL/s) and liver  (alkaline phosphatase < 110 U/L ,  bilirubin < 21 pimol/L) function .
Staging evaluation included a complete medical history and  physical examination ,  cystoscopy ,  chest x-ray ,  bipedal lymphangiogram ,  intravenous (IV) pyelogram ,  complete blood counts ,  and  biochemistries .
Following external-beam irradiation ,  a single low-dose rate  intracavitary application was performed .
Chemotherapy consisted of bleomycin 15 U intramuscularly (IM) every 12 hours from days 1 to 4 (total dose ,  120 U) ,   vincristine 1 mg/m2 IV on day 1 ,  mitomycin 10 mg/im 2 IV on day 1 ,  and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1 ,  given on an outpatient  basis every 3 weeks for three cycles .
Potassium chloride at 20 mEq/L and magnesium sulfate were added as needed .
Six months after activation of the study ,  after nine patients had been treated with CT ,  the bleomycin dose was reduced to 15  U IM every 12 hours from day 1 to day 3 (total dose ,  90 U) ,  and after the first year ,  cisplatin administration was changed  from day 1 to day 4 .
Although not a requirement of the  study ,  attempts were made to keep the hemoglobin level > 120 g/L during pelvic irradiation .
Patients were stratified by  age (< 50 years v > 50 years) ,  extensiveness of parametrial involvement (unilateral v bilateral) ,  and lymphangiogram nodal  findings (negative v positive) .
We planned to accrue 60 patients into each treatment arm ,  which would produce a power of 80%  and detect an improvement of 25 % in survival with the combined modality treatment at the a = 0.05 level (two-sided test) .
Seven patients were not included in response assessment in the combined modality group ,  four patients who died  of CT complications ,  two who died of metastatic disease ,  all of them before commencement of RT ,  and one other patient whosepelvic disease progressed during CT and who received palliative irradiation only because of poor general condition .
The rationale for the use of neoadjuvant CT23 is that (1) the blood supply to the tumor is not compromised by previous  radiotherapy or surgery allowing for better drug distribution into the tumor ,  (2) patients' tolerance to CT may be enhanced  as performance status and marrow reserve are unaltered by previous treatment ,  (3) decreasing the bulkiness of the primary  disease would improve the effectiveness of the local RT ,  (4) there is the possibility of eradication of subclinical  metastases ,  and (5) theoretically a tumor may be more chemosensitive before surgery or RT .
Although 25.5% of the patients achieved a CR following three cycles of BOMP and 47% of the CT + RT group obtained a CR at the  end of RT ,  the 5-year overall survival was significantly inferior in the CT + RT group than in the control arm (39% v 21% ,  P  = .02) .
It cannot be accounted for by patient  selection as both groups were well balanced for the wellknown prognostic factors in stage III carcinoma of the cervix.4'24-27  More importantly ,  all patients in the CT + RT arm completed pelvic RT ,  as defined by the protocol guidelines ,  and therefore ,   inadequate irradiation dosage cannot explain the poorer results .
Thus ,  a PR or even a CR could therefore  be of questionable value in determining therapeutic effectiveness ,  as tumor masses would be still regressing while the  subclinical clonogenic cell repopulation is accelerating .
The mechanisms responsible for such cross-resistance  remain to be determined ,  but recent studies have shown significant similarity between the cytotoxicity of irradiation and  alkylating agents and that tumor cells may develop mechanisms of resistance capable of decreasing the cytotoxic effects of  some antineoplastic drugs as well as radiation .
