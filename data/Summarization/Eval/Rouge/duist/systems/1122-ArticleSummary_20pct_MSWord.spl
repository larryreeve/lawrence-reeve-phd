There have been multiple studies published which have retrospectively analyzed the outcome of patients at risk for recurrence who received adjuvant therapy compared to those patients not receiving adjuvant therapy .
The initial accrual goal of the trial was 160 patients ,  with 80 patients randomized to each of the two treatment arms .
Twenty-five patients had 3 or more high70 years .
Seventy-five patients had a Stage IB cervical cancer risk factors and 64 had 1 to 2 risk factors; 33 of these patients and the remaining 14 patients had a Stage IIA cancer .
All had 1 risk factor .
Forty-five patients were randomized to the chemotherapy withdrawn by the institutional principal investigator due to plus radiation therapy treatment arm and 44 patients received poor medical condition of the patient (n ? 1) .
There were 12 major protocol viola-patients received only a portion of the proscribed treatment; tions ,  including 7 patients who were randomized (6 to che-one patient ,  randomized to chemotherapy ,  withdrew after chemotherapy plus radiation therapy and 1 patient to chemother-experiencing an allergic bleomycin reaction during the initial chemotherapy alone) and then either refused treatment (n ?6) or were infusion of bleomycin during cycle 1. free and overall survival .
Overall survival and disease-free One patient developed radiation proctitis re-has been no significant difference in disease-free survival requiring a colostomy after completion of the prescribed dose between the two treatment groups (Fig .
2); 10 patients in of pelvic radiation therapy .
the chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation therapy arm have experienced recurrences compared to 9 recurrences in the group of patients treated with chemotherapy alone .
recurrence rates .
Radiation therapy alone probably reduces Killackey et al .
reported no recurrences among 22 patients with cervical cancer at high risk after radical hysterectomy utilizing a similar treatment regimen consisting of chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation therapy .
Tattersall et al .
were unable to demonstrate a difference in disease-free or overall survival in 71 patients randomized to either pelvic radiation versus chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation after radical hysterectomy for Stage IB–IIA cervical cancer .
The risk factors did not appear to be additive ,  since the disease-free and overall survival were similar when patients with 1–2 risk factors were compared to those patients with 3 or more risk factors .
Additionally ,  if the patient does experience a local or regional recurrence after chemotherapy ,  pelvic radiation therapy still has curative potential .
Investigators who design adjuvant trials for patients at high risk for recurrence after radical hysterectomy for invasive cervical cancer must balance the potential benefit to be gained by a minority of patients against the risks inherent in treating all patients .
