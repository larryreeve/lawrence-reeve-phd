Radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea has been compared in separate trials with radiotherapy alone ,  with radiotherapy and concomitant therapy with misonidazole ,  and with radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil (and Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) .
However ,  myelosuppression is a limiting toxic effect of treatment with hydroxyurea ,  whereas cisplatin is less myelosuppressive and can be given weekly during radiotherapy ,  with acceptable levels of toxicity .
Eligibility .
The institutions that participated in the study are listed in the Appendix .
Women with untreated invasive squamous-cell carcinoma ,  adenosquamous carcinoma ,  or adenocarcinoma of the cervix of International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIB (localized disease with parametrial involvement) ,  stage III (extension of the tumor to the pelvic wall) ,  or stage IVB (involvement of the bladder or rectal mucosa) were enrolled in the study from April 1992 to April 1997 .
Patients with disease outside the pelvis and those with metastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes or intraperitoneal disease were not eligible .
Patients were required to have a Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status of 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  or 3 (equivalent to Karnofsky performance scores of 90 or 100 ,  70 or 80 ,  50 or 60 ,  and 30 or 40 ,  respectively) and to have no history of other cancers .
Radiotherapy .
Radiotherapy was administered to the whole pelvic region in 24 fractions totaling 40.8 Gy or 30 fractions totaling 51.0 Gy ,  followed one to three weeks later by intracavitary brachytherapy (the insertion of a radioactive implant) .
Pelvic radiation was delivered by anteroposterior and posteroanterior parallel ports or a four-field box technique (anteroposterior ,  posteroanterior ,  and two lateral fields) with an x-ray energy of at least 4-MV photons .
For the lateral fields ,  the anterior border was the anterior border of the pubic symphysis and the posterior border was the space between S2 and S3 .
If intracavitary brachytherapy could not be delivered ,  the tumor was treated with additional external-beam radiotherapy ,  for a total dose of 61.2 Gy .
The length of delays in radiotherapy ,  in days ,  was calculated by subtracting the planned duration of radiotherapy (the number of prescribed fractions plus 2 weekend days for every five fractions plus 10 days for each implant) from the actual duration of radiotherapy .
The Radiological Physics Center in Houston reviewed all technical aspects of radiotherapy and verified the calibration of the instruments used .
Treatment with cisplatin was discontinued if the leukocyte count dropped below 2500 per cubic millimeter or the platelet count dropped below 50,000 per cubic millimeter ,  and it was resumed once the counts rose above these levels .
Thus ,  because of the large difference in outcome among the treatment groups and the similarity between the rates of survival and progression-free survival within each of the treatment groups ,  this analysis is the final analysis of survival and progression-free survival .
The performance of these interim tests raised the type I error by only 0.05 percent .
Because of this negligible increase and to simplify the presentation ,  the P values were not adjusted for the results of the interim analyses .
After adjustment for these five factors ,  the relative risks of disease progression for the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea were extremely close (relative risks ,  0.58 and 0.55 ,  respectively) to the estimates obtained after adjustment for clinical stage of disease alone .
Chemotherapy .
The highest combined frequency of grade 3 (moderate) and grade 4 (severe) adverse effects was associated with treatment with radiotherapy and the three-drug regimen ,  the frequency in the other two groups was similar .
These results suggest that the principal effect of cisplatin is radiosensitization .
Many combinations of cisplatin have been studied in phase 2 trials of patients with cervical cancer .
In the phase 3 study by Morris et al. ,  whose results are reported in this issue of the Journal ,  radiotherapy in combination with treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil significantly improved the rates of disease-free survival and overall survival among women with stage IB through IVA cervical cancer .
The frequencies of grades 3 and 4 leukopenia were significantly higher with the three-drug combination than with the two single-drug regimens .
Closer analysis of this study showed a dose-dependent effect of the brachytherapy on late rectal complications .
Adverse urologic effects have occurred in mice treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy with cisplatin ,  but increased rates of urologic complications were not observed in our study .
Several studies have suggested that the total length of treatment influences the efficacy of radiotherapy .
Treatment with cisplatin alone was less toxic than treatment with the three-drug regimen .
