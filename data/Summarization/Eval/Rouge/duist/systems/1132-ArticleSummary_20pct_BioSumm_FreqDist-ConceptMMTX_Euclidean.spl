The trial was performed after approval by local institutional ethics committee .
Of these ,  16 were excluded from this analysis .
Patient characteristics are outlined  in Table 1 .
Both fields were treated on each day of treatment .
RT was started 3 to 4 weeks after completion of the third cycle .
Hydration consistedof 1L of normal  saline infused IV over 3 hours before cisplatin administration .
Postcisplatin hydration consisted of 1.5 L of 5% dextrose in  water in 0.5 normal saline given over 3 hours .
Dexamethasone and metoclopramide were  used as antiemetics .
Patients in the combined modality group were also assessed for local response at the completion of CT and before  the start of RT .
End Points .
During RT ,  patients were assessed weekly  and were questioned about the presence of treatment-related symptoms .
Statistical Analysis .
Patients were randomly allocated to the two treatment arms by drawing cards in sealed envelopes .
Comparisons of variables between groups  were based on the X2 test .
At the end of therapy ,  or even after several months posttreatment ,  it is difficult to be  certain whether some of the pelvic findings are due to residual tumor or postirradiation fibrosis ,  allowing misinterpretation  of tumor responses .
In Table 4 ,  we show the number of patients still alive in spite of their disease being classified as PR  at the end of treatment .
For the partial responders ,  57% in the RT arm and 37.5% in the CT + RT are alive with no evidence of  disease progression at a minimum follow-up time of 3 years .
As of December 1989 ,  31 of the 52 patients in the RT group and 30 of 39 in the CT + RT had died .
Table 5 shows the  sites of disease failure .
About two thirds of patients experienced moderate to  severe nausea/vomiting .
Skin hyperpigmentation was observed in half of the treated patients ,  being of severe degree in one  third .
A more detailed  description of the pulmonary toxicity has been the subject of another report.' .
Grade 2 3  proctitis was seen more frequently on CT + RT .
During  atheterization ,  her bladder was perforated .
Postmortem study showed no evidence of  cervical cancer .
DISCUSSION .
Vogl et al'" treated 16 patients with advanced local and/or metastatic cancer of the  uterine cervix .
The reason for this surprising and disturbing finding is not entirely clear .
The choice of end point in assessing the therapeuticbenefit of a new  treatment modality in advanced carcinoma of the cervix has to be determined carefully .
In this study ,  27% of the patients (14 of 52) in  the RT group were called partial responders at the end of irradiation .
Of these ,  57% remain alive with no evidence of disease  progression .
Similarly ,  in the combined treatment group ,  37.5% of the partial responders are still alive and well .
In fact ,  this approach might be detrimental ,  as demonstrated in the present study .
