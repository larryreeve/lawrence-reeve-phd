The purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate ,  by such a randomized and controlled comparison ,  a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5-FU activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials .
Overall therapeutic results were discouraging ,  specifically in colorectal cancer ,  a Mayo Clinic study demonstrated only one response among 30 patients ,  a study of the Baltimore Cancer Research Program showed no responses among 21 patients ,  and a New York Memorial study demonstrated only two minor responses among 19 evaluated patients .
Contraindications to selection included a WBC count < 4.000/mm or a platelet count < 130.000/mm. a serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL. complete disability (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group IECOG] performance score 4). recent major surgery (exploration and biopsy only. < 14 days ,  resection or bypass surgery ,  < 21 days) ,  an uncontrolled infectious process. frequent vomiting or severe anorexia ,  any previous chemotherapy ,  and intensive radiation to the axial skeleton within the preceding 4 weeks .
Courses of therapy were repeated every 5 weeks. 5-FU plus levamisole. 5-FU was administered in undiluted form by rapid IV injection at a dose of 500 mg/m 2/d for 5 consecutive days .
For the 5-FU plus thymidine regimen ,  patients were evaluated every 4 weeks ,  while for all other regimens ,  this evaluation occurred every 5 weeks .
Each combination regimen was compared to treatment with 5- FU alone with respect to duration of survival following randomization ,  time to disease progression. objective regression rates among measurable patients ,  and toxic reactions .
MOF-Strept was characterized by substantially more frequent and more severe nausea and vomiting ,  and this was the only regimen characterized by a substantive incidence of thrombocytopenia. 5-FU plus PALA had substantially more frequent mucocutaneous reactions and somewhat more frequent diarrhea ,  but less hematologic toxicity than 5-FU alone or any of the other regimens .
This was confirmed by a stratified Cox analysis ,  adjusting for key prognostic covariates ,  which indicated that the data were inconsistent with any combination regimen yielding a 50% increase in survival relative to 5-FU (ie ,  a hazard ratio of 1 .5) ,  wherefore 5-FU plus PALA ,  P < .01 ,  5-FU plus thymidine ,  P < .0001 ,  5-FU plus levamisole ,  P < .01 ,  and MOF-Strept ,  P < .05 .
