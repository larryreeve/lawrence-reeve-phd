The incidence of failure to control pelvic disease following radical irradiation is about 40% .
Thus ,  we designed the randomized trial to compare the tumor response and survival rate of patients with advanced cervical carcinoma receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus patients receiving radiotherapy alone .
Other eligibility criteria consisted of a pathologically verified squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix ,  a Karnofsky performance status index of 80% or above ,  and an age of younger than 70 years .
Pretreatment evaluation included a complete medical history and physical examination ,  complete blood count ,  serum electrolytes ,  chemistry profile ,  tumor markers ,  chest X ray ,  an electrocardiogram ,  and contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis .
Extraperitoneal staging laparotomy was performed if aspiration cytology was negative .
External beam irradiation was started on Day 1 and delivered using a linear accelerator of 10-MV photons to the whole pelvis using a four-field box technique .
In the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group ,  chemotherapeutic regimens consisted of cisplatin (50 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously at the rate of 1 mg/min on Day 1) ,  vincristine (1 mg/m2 intravenously push on Day 2) ,  and bleomycin (25 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously infusion in divided doses on Days 2 ,  3 ,  and 4) which were given starting on Day 1 of radiotherapy and then every 3 weeks for a total of four courses .
Flexible granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 2 mg/kg/day administration was used to prevent neutropenia and further infection .
The patients had to have a white-cell count of at least 3000/m3 and a platelet count of at least 100,000/m3 before the next course could be administered .
The primary objectives were to compare the two treatment groups with respect to tumor response ,  failure patterns ,  disease-free interval ,  and actuarial survival .
At a two-sided P value of 0.05 ,  with the use of a Pearson x2 approximation ,  the estimated power was 80% an improvement of 25% in survival with the concurrent therapy at the a Å 0.05 level (two-sided test) .
The median follow-up was 46.8 months (range ,  12 ­ 69 months) .
Acute (between initiation of therapy to 6 weeks after therapy) and late treatment-related toxicity (6 weeks after therapy) are listed in Tables 3 and 4 .
Although there was no significant difference between the two compared groups with regard to treatment-related late toxicity (concurrent group 23.3% versus radiation group 12.9% ,  P = 0.13) , a nonsignificant trend toward a higher rate of late toxicity in the chemoradiotherapy group is evident .
Analysis by Kaplan ­ Meier method showed that the actuarial survival was not statistically different between the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups (mean survival time ,  38.1 months versus 41.5 months ,  P Å 0.27) .
Several studies have confirmed that bulky cervical cancer and extensive parametrial invasion are indeed poor prognostic features .
Therefore ,  in an attempt to improve tumor control and survival in patients with advanced cervical carcinoma ,  the treatment efficacy and tolerability of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy using cisplatin-based chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer needs to be explored .
The concept of concurrent chemoradiotherapy offers a number of theoretical advantages ,  which produces no delay in the start of definitive radiotherapy ,  no time gap to induce cross-resistance ,  and the possibility of eradication of subclinical metastasis .
The published trials in advanced cervical carcinoma with concurrent chemoradiotherapy ,  either a single-agent weekly cisplatin or in combination with cisplatin ­ 5-FU or cisplatin ­ bleomycin ­ vincristine ,  yield tumor response rates of approximately 80% ,  and 3-year survival rates reached 50 to 60% of patients .
Only a randomized trial ,  using a single agent of weekly cisplatin in combination with radiotherapy ,  has shown a significant improvement in local ­ regional control when compared with radiation alone .
To further increase the systemic activity and the radiation-enhancing potential of the chemotherapy ,  we chose cisplatin-based regimens with vincristine and bleomycin in this trial because it had proven high efficacy of local control in our previous phase I and II trials for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
The most likely explanation for the poor results in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group is the higher treatmentrelated toxicity ,  and that could limit the dose of definitive radiation employed or interrupt the planned radiotherapy .
Our results demonstrated that multiagent chemoradiotherapy ,  concurrently administrated with radiation to improve tumor response ,  can also produce serious acute and late toxicities ,  and life-threatening complications .
Thus ,  tumor masses would be still regressing while the subclinical clonogenic cell repopulation in accelerating .
