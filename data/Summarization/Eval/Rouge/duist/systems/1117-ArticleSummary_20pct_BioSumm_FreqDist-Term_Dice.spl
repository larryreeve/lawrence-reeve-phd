Between September ,  1986 ,  and December ,  1991 ,  578 patients with primary invasive cervical cancer were referred to the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Radiation Oncology ,  at the Istituto di Scienze Biomediche S Gerardo ,  University of Milan ,  Monza .
We used the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) clinical staging system to classify the stage of cancer.7 If there was disagreement about the stage ,  the case was assigned to the earlier stage. 468 patients had FIGO stage Ib or IIa disease. 343 of these patients were enrolled after they had given their informed consent to take part .
Eligibility criteria were ,  age 30–70 years ,  newly diagnosed stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  no concurrent or previous malignant disease ,  WHO performance status of 1 or less ,  and feasibility of both radical surgery and radiotherapy .
Radiotherapy included ,  external pelvic irradiation with 18 MV photon beam by the multiportal technique ,  one dose of 1·8–2·0Gy at the isocentre ,  and two or more portals treated daily .
A complete computerised plane was made ,  according to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements report no 38.8 The total dose at point A (external beam plus brachyradiotherapy) ranged from 70 Gy to 90 Gy (median 76 Gy) .
When lymphangiography showed common iliac or paraortic metastases ,  paraortic lymph nodes were treated with a dose of 45 Gy over 5 weeks and two shaped opposed fields (AP-PA) .
Dissection of the pelvic lymph node consisted of removal of all fatty lymph-node bearing tissue anterior ,  lateral ,  and posterior to the common , external ,  and internal iliac vessels ,  and anterior to the obturator nerve .
Patients who had at least one of the following pathological risk factors received adjuvant radiotherapy ,  surgical stage greater than pT2a ,  less than 3 mm of uninvolved cervical stroma ,  cutthrough ,  and lymph-node metastases .
Adjuvant radiotherapy consisted of external pelvic irradiation (18 MV X-rays) with the multiportal technique ,  one fraction of 1·8–2·0 Gy daily ,  with a total dose of 50·4 Gy over 5–6 weeks .
We classified complications as ,  grade 1 ,  mild symptoms not affecting the patient’s health and easily cured ,  grade 2 ,  symptoms that can be resolved by long-term medical therapies ,  grade 3 ,  major symptoms that require surgery or invasive procedures and affect the performance status of the patient ,  or fatal complications .
We used multivariate Cox regression analysis to assess the effect of cervical size ,  age ,  FIGO state ,  histological type ,  grade of differentiation ,  radiological lymph-node status ,  and treatment group on overall survival .
Of the 468 patients with FIGO stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  125 were excluded because of age (<30 years ,  >70 years ,  n=43) ,  medical illness (n=54) ,  previous or concurrent malignant disease (n=21) ,  or the referring physician’s or patient’s preference for surgery ,  radiotherapy ,  or chemoradiotherapy (n=7) .
After randomisation ,  there were six protocol violations ,  two in the surgery group (one progression before operation and one refusal of any therapy after randomisation) and four in the radiotherapy group (two patients whose cancer was incorrectly staged and two with synchronous neoplasia) .
Adjuvant radiotherapy was done in 62 (54%) of the 114 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter of 4 cm or smaller and in 46 (84%) of 55 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm. 19 patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or less and three patients whose cervical diameter was greater than 4 cm had lymph-vascular-space involvement as the only pathological risk factor ,  these patients did not receive postoperative irradiation .
The overall and disease-free actuarial 5-year survival for all patients were 83% and 74% ,  respectively ,  and did not differ significantly between the groups (figure 2). 5-year actuarial survival stratified by cervical diameter was similar in the surgery and radiotherapy groups (diameter < 4 cm ,  87% vs 90% ,  diameter >4 cm ,  70% vs 72% ,  figure 3 ,  table 3). 5-year actuarial disease-free survival for the surgery and radiotherapy groups was 80% and 82% ,  respectively ,  for patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or smaller ,  and 63% and 57% for those with a diameter larger than 4 cm ,  the between group differences were not significant .
The median time to recurrence did not differ significantly between the surgery and radiotherapy groups (20 vs 18 months ,  p=0·24). 82% of pelvic recurrences and 61% of the distant ones became evident within 2 years of the primary treatment .
Of the 86 patients who developed a recurrence ,  50 (58%) had local or pelvic recurrence (22 [52%] in the surgery group vs 28 [64%] in the radiotherapy group ,  p=0·42) ,  and 36 (42%) had distant metastases (20 [48%] vs 16 [36%] ,  p=0·62) ,  five of these 36 patients also had a pelvic recurrence .
In addition ,  among women with a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm ,  there was a significantly higher rate of pelvic relapse among those who had radiotherapy than among those who had surgery plus adjuvant irradiation (16 [70%] vs 9 [53%] ,  p=0·46) .
Complications were classified according to the glossary of Chassagne and colleagues.10 In the surgery group ,  48 (28%) patients showed severe (grade 2–3) morbidity that required medical or surgical treatment ,  compared with 19 (12%) patients in the radiotherapy group ,  (p=0·0004 ,  table 3) .
Hydroureteronephrosis was recorded in ,  two (3%) of 61 patients who had surgery alone ,  11 (10%) of 108 patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy ,  and eight (5%) of 158 patients who had radiotherapy alone (p=0·1) .
Other vesical complications (severe actinic cystitis ,  stress incontinence ,  high-pressure bladder) were recorded in two (3%) patients after surgery ,  11 (10%) after surgery plus radiotherapy ,  and in eight (5%) after radiotherapy alone .
In the radiotherapy group ,  one patient had intestinal perforation ,  one rectovaginal fistula ,  and 12 severe proctites.Severe oedema of the legs occurred in ten (9%) patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy ,  in one (0·6%) patient who had radiotherapy alone ,  and in none of the patients who had surgery alone .
Newton5 reported that the 5-year survival rate for 119 patients with stage-I disease accrued over 10 years in a partly randomised study was 81% for radical surgery and 74% for radiotherapy ,  this difference was not significant .
Morley and Seski’s study ,  of 446 patients with stage-Ib disease recruited between 1945 and 1975 and treated with radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy or external irradiation and brachyradiotherapy ,  reported crude 5-year survival of 87% and 83% ,  respectively .
On the other hand ,  the low rate of major complications after radiotherapy (12%) suggests that this approach is well-tolerated by most patients. 25% of the surgery-group patients and 26% patients in the radiotherapy group developed neoplastic recurrence .
In Italy ,  a prospective randomised trial has been under way since 1993 to assess the best adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) for high-risk patients after radical surgery for FIGO stage Ib–IIa cancer .
This finding should resolve some of the conflicting approaches to this issue.14–16 Our results suggest that the optimum candidates for primary radical surgery are women with normal ovarian function and cervical diameters of 4 cm or smaller ,  whereas radiotherapy is preferable for postmenopausal women .
Women whose cervical diameters are larger than 4 cm should be identified before surgery so that they can benefit from tailored treatment ,  radical radiotherapy ,  with the option of concomitant radiosensitising chemotherapy to improve the local control of the disease ,  or cisplatinbased chemotherapy followed by radical surgery .
An Italian prospective randomised trial of radical radiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery in patients with squamous neoplasia and cervical diameters larger than 4 cm has been in progress since 1991 .
