Unfortunately , the list of active drugs is short and combinations have not shown a consistent improvement over single agents .
The principal toxicity of mitolactol is hematologic ,  while that of cisplatin is nonhematologic .
Nevertheless ,  the possibility existed that the combination ,  with two CRs and five PRs (39% response rate) ,  produced improved results .
Ifosfamide is a new agent closely related to cyclophosphamide ,  but with less marrow toxicity and more bladder toxicity that requires concomitant use of the uroprotectormesna .
Treatment of cervix cancer with the combination of ifosfamide ,  cisplatin ,  and bleomycin yielded a 69% response rate (49 patients) in one series .
The result was impressive ,  but the importance of bleomycin was unclear and its toxicity sometimes troublesome ,  so we proposed to compare cisplatin alone versus a regimen of cisplatinplus mitolactol (C + M) and a regimen of cisplatin plusifosfamide (and mesna) (CIFX) .
No subsequent treatment course was to begin until the WBC count was greater than 4,000/uL and the platelet count 100,000uL .
Therapy was to be delayed week by week until these levels were exceeded .
Dose adjustments were specified for hematologic ,  gastrointestinal ,  renal ,  and neurologic toxicity .
Toxicity was graded according to standard cooperative group criteria .
Ten patients did not receive the randomized study treatment .
Toxicity .
CNS toxicity ranged from confusion to somnolence to coma and/or seizures .
In all cases except one fatal case ,  CNS toxicity was reversible .
Subsequently ,  no fatal CNS toxicity was observed ,  but lesser degrees of encephalopathy continued to be observed more frequently on the CIFX arm .
The treatment arms were well balanced in this regard and there was no evidence that the treatment comparisons were distorted by this prior treatment .
In the present trial ,  there was a significant improvement in PFS associated with CIFX ,  however ,  its impact on the patient's sense of well-being was not assessed .
Since there was no overall survival improvement ,  it is unclear to what extent the improvement in PFS or in response rate actually benefitted the patients .
Since the role of bleomycin in cervix cancer is unclear ,  but implies restricting therapy to patients with good pulmonary function ,  we elected not to include bleomycinin the present study .
A report that indicated mitolactol therapy of breast cancer was associated with myelodysplasia and secondary leukemias is of concern .
Although we are not aware of such complications in the present trial ,  the possible risk of secondary malignancies plus the failure to show an improvement in outcome for C + M would suggest a limited future for mitolactol in the treatment of cervix cancer .
One of the earlier GOG trials showed an improved overall response rate (31.4% v 20.7% ,  P = .015) with double-dose cisplatin (100 mg/m2) ,  but no improvement in CR rate ,  PFI ,  or survival .
