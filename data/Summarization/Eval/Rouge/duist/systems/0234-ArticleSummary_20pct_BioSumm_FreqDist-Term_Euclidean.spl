Its use ,  however ,  is limited by cumulative ,  dose-dependent ,  chronic cardiotoxicity .
Preclinical studies suggest that this may be possible by structural alteration of the anthracyline molecule .
It is a stereoisomer of DOX in which the hydroxyl group at the 4' position of the aminosugar side chain is epimerized (Fig 1) .
The acute toxicity was qualitatively similar to that seen with DOX .
Areas of increased uptake on bone scan were further studied with roentgenograms to determine the nature of the abnormalities .
Liver scans were done only if there was elevation of the hepatic enzymes on the biochemical profile .
Blood counts were initially monitored weekly ,  and then less frequently after the pattern of myelosuppression was established .
Biochemical profiles were repeated every six weeks .
Study DesignAfter determining eligibility ,  informed consent was obtained .
Treatment ProtocolEPI was supplied by Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Milan ,  Italy) in a powdered form that was reconstituted with sterile water for injection United States Pharmacopeia .
It was anticipated that these doses would produce equivalent degrees of myelosuppression .
Doses were adjusted based on the degree of myelosuppression observed using a predetermined schedule .
Duration of response was measured from the first day of initiation of therapy until progressive disease was  documented .
RNCA was done with thepatients in supine position at rest and during maximum symptom limited bicycle exercise .
Patients' RBCs were labeled in vivo by injecting 10 to 20 mCi of technetium 99m IV 30 minutes after stannous pyrophosphate injection .
Images of the left ventricle were recorded by positioning the camera in the left anterior oblique position ,  using a computer-based procedure gated to the electrocardiogram .
LVEF was determined by computer-assisted analysis of left ventricular time-activity curves .
Imaging was obtained for three minutes at the point of maximal tolerable exercise .
Statistical MethodsComparison of response rates between the two arms was made using a chi-square test .
Several other comparisons ,  such as percent of projected dose ,  used the two-sample Wilcoxon test .
All hypothesis tests were two-sided .
Although all patients had received prior chemotherapy which included cyclophosphamide or other alkylating agent ,  no patient had been previously treated with mitomycin C .
No patient was being treated with digitalis glycosides or antiarrhythmics .
Complete responses were not observed in either arm .
This patient had been extensively treated with radiation and chemotherapy before treatment on this protocol .
Other common toxicities included nausea ,  vomiting ,  and alopecia .
These data were also analyzed taking into consideration the difference in myelosuppressive potency between the two drugs .
As noted above ,  the doses of the drugs were adjusted to produce an equivalent degree of myelosuppression .
The difference remains statistically significant with a P value of .04 .
This sometimes ,  but not always ,  occurred  before the development of symptomatic congestive cardiomyopathy .
Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the cardiotoxic effects of DOX .
Development of less cardiotoxic ,  but equally efficacious ,  anthracylines is an alternative approach .
Studies of structure-activity relationships demonstrate that changes at the position of the aminosugar moiety affect toxicity ,  and indicate that cardiotoxicity can be separated from therapeutic effect .
The optimal method for monitoring the cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines is controversial .
However ,  RNCA alone has also been useful in studying anthracycline cardiotoxicity .
Potential selection factors that might bias the comparison of cardiac effects are thereby avoided .
The design of these studies differed ,  however .
In the multidrug study ,  no clinical cardiac dysfunction was seen in the EPI-containing (FEC) arm .
Young ,  unpublished data ,  January ,  1985 ,  New York) .
These findings ,  which are supported by the independent work of several other investigators ,  provide encouragement for further clinical trials with EPI .
