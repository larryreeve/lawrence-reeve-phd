Phase III studies of patients whose disease had not responded to first-line fluorouracil ,  or patients whose disease had progressed after first-line fluorouracil treatment ,  showed increased survival times in patients given irinotecan compared with those receiving best supportive care or high-dose fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone by continuous infusion .
Phase I dose-escalation studies were done to test combined irinotecan with fluorouracil and calcium folinate weekly or every 2 weeks .
We did a phase III multicentre randomised trial that was designed to assess whether the addition of irinotecan to fluorouracil and calcium folinate would benefit patients previously untreated with chemotherapy (other than adjuvant) for metastatic colorectal cancer .
From May ,  1997 ,  to February ,  1998 ,  we enrolled patients who met the following eligibility criteria ,  histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum ,  age 18-75 years ,  WHO performance status of 2 or less and life expectancy of more than 3 months ,  haemoglobin 100 g/L or more ,  absolute neutrophil count 2.0 10/L ,  platelets 150 10/L or more ,  creatinine 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal ,  total bilirubin 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal ,  aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 3.0 or less times the upper limit of normal (if liver metastases present ,  1.5 or less times for bilirubin and 5.0 or less times for aspartate and alanine aminotransferases) ,  and no previous (other than adjuvant) chemotherapy ,  finished more than 6 months before randomisation .
Before the start of the study ,  each investigator chose one of two proposed regimens for fluorouracil and calcium folinate ,  according to local clinical practice or preference (De Gramont [every 2 weeks] or Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internische Onkologie ,  cooperative German group for oncology [once weekly]) .
For the irinotecan group ,  the regimens were ,  once weekly ,  irinotecan 80 mg/m with fluorouracil 2300 mg/m by 24 h infusion ,  plus calcium folinate 500 mg/m (n=54) ,  or ,  every 2 weeks ,  irinotecan 180 mg/m on day 1 with fluorouracil 400 mg/m bolus and 600 mg/m by 22 h infusion ,  plus calcium folinate 200 mg/m on days 1 and 2 (n=145) .
For the noirinotecan group ,  the regimens were ,  once-weekly ,  fluorouracil 2600 mg/m by 24 h infusion plus calcium folinate 500 mg/m2 (n=43) ,  or every 2 weeks ,  fluorouracil and calcium folinate at the same doses and administration as in the irinotecan-group 2weekly regimen (n=143) .
The secondary endpoints for efficacy were time to progression ,  duration of response ,  time to treatment failure ,  and overall survival .
The questionnaire includes five scales for functioning ,  one scale for global health status ,  and nine symptom scales .
We needed to include 338 evaluable patients to show a significant difference in response rate between treatment groups ,  assuming response rates of 35% in the no-irinotecan group and 50% in the irinotecan group ,  by use of two-tailed X tests (a=0.05 ,  power 0.80) .
Based on the assumption that time to progression would be 6 months in the no-irinotecan group and 9 months in the irinotecan group ,  we calculated that 286 patients were needed to show a significant difference for this variable .
We analysed the intention-to-treat population and calculated response rates for the intention-to-treat and evaluable populations.  2 tests were used to compare categorical variables between treatment groups .
The first group included countries that had recruited more than 30 patients (UK ,  Spain ,  France ,  Czech Republic ,  Germany ,  and Austria) ,  the second countries that had recruited 10.30 patients (Belgium ,  Israel ,  South Africa ,  Switzerland ,  and Italy) ,  and the third countries that had recruited fewer than ten patients (Greece ,  Portugal ,  and the Netherlands) .
We tested the nine following variables ,  sex ,  WHO performance status (<2 and <=2) ,  weight loss (<=5% and >5%) ,  number of organs involved (<3 and <=3) ,  primary tumour site (colon or rectum) ,  organ involvement (liver only or other sites) ,  time from first diagnosis to first metastasis (0.3 ,  >3-12 ,  >12 months) ,  previous surgery ,  and previous adjuvant therapy .
For time to progression ,  Cox's proportional hazards modelling was used ,  with the following variables ,  sex ,  age (<58 and <=58 years) ,  WHO performance status (<2 and >= 2) ,  weight loss (<=5% and >5%) ,  number of organs involved (<3 and >=3) ,  primary tumour site (colon or rectum) ,  liver involvement ,  lymph-node involvement ,  time from first diagnosis to first metastasis (0-3 ,  >3.12 ,  >12 months) ,  previous surgery ,  previous adjuvant therapy ,  time from first diagnosis and first infusion (<9 and <=9 months) .
The other 288 patients received treatment every 2 weeks (145 in the irinotecan group and 143 in the no-irinotecan group) .
A higher proportion of women were assigned fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone than the irinotecan regimen ,  and the rectum was the primary tumour site in a higher proportion of patients in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group .
Tumour characteristics and history in the two groups were comparable ,  except for previous surgery ,  since 89% of patients had had surgery in the irinotecan group and 95% in the no-irinotecan group .
39.4% of patients in the irinotecan group and 58.3% in the no-irinotecan group received further chemotherapy ,  31.0% of the no-irinotecan group subseqently received irinotecan .
The median time to onset of response was 8.9 (range 4.7-25.4) weeks in the irinotecan group medians.21 The probability of survival in the irinotecan group was 84.9% at 9 months and 75.5% at 12 months ,  and in the no-irinotecan group was 77.3% and 62.7% ,  respectively .
In the intention-to-treat analysis of the 2weekly regimen ,  the response rate was ,  for the irinotecan and 11.4 (5.3-29.6) weeks in the no-irinotecan group .
Time to progression was longer in the irinotecan than in the noirinotecan group (median 6.7 [0+.13.8+] vs 4.4 group and the no-irinotecan group ,  33.1% (95% CI 25.5-41.4) and 21.0% (14.6-28.6 ,  p=0.021) ,  median time to progression was 6.5 (range 0+.13.2) months and 3.7 (0+.13.1+) months (p=0.001) ,  and median survival was 17.4 (0.4-28.3+) months and 13.0 (0.5-27.6+) months .
The effect of treatment was significant (p<0.001) ,  the Survival in the irinotecan group was significantly longer hazard ratio for response was 2.6 times higher in the than in the no-irinotecan group (median 17.4 [0.4-28.4+] irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group ,  given the same degree of weight loss at baseline and the same time between first diagnosis and first metastasis .
There was insufficient power to compare the efficacy risk of progression for a patient in the no-irinotecan group was increased by about 69% compared with that for a patient in the irinotecan group when all other variables were equal .
In the irinotecan group ,  diarrhoea and neutropenia were the most common toxic effects in each regimen ,  and were significantly more frequent and severe than in the noirinotecan group .
In the irinotecan group ,  admission was required for fever in the absence of infection with concomitant grade 3 or 4 neutropenia for five (9.3%) patients on the weekly regimen and one (0.7%) on the 2-weekly regimen ,  for the no-irinotecan group ,  admission was required for one (2.3%) patient on the weekly regimen and none on the 2 weekly regimen .
When missing data for death ,  progressive disease ,  or grade 3.4 adverse events were taken into account with the two imputation methods ,  results were biased in favour of the no-irinotecan group .
Combination of irinotecan with fluorouracil and calcium folinate significantly increased response rates ,  time to progression ,  and survival .
The survival advantage was reached ,  despite a higher proportion of patients receiving further chemotherapy in the no-irinotecan group (58.3 vs 39.4%) .
This study population was large (385 patients treated) ,  and the patients were representative of candidates for first-line chemotherapy in clinical practice ,  except that an unexpectedly high proportion of them had synchronous metastases at baseline and ,  consequently ,  a relatively low proportion of them had had previous adjuvant chemotherapy .
Another phase III study that compared irinotecan combined with bolus fluorouracil and fluorouracil alone consistently provided significantly higher response rates (33 vs 18% ,  p<0.001) and median time to treatment failure (5.0 vs 3.8 months ,  p<0.05) in the irinotecan group .
