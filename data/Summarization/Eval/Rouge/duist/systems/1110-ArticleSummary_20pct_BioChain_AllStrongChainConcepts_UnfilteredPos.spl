OF the estimated 13,700 women in the United States in whom invasive cervical cancer was diagnosed in 1998 ,  nearly 5000 will ultimately die of the disease because of the inadequacies of current treatment .
The nationwide use of such screening programs has greatly reduced the incidence of invasive cervical cancer .
A previous study reported improved survival among women with locally advanced cervical cancer who received prophylactic radiation to the para-aortic nodes .
To eradicate micrometastases and sensitize tumor cells to radiation ,  several studies have explored the use of radiotherapy with concomitant chemotherapy .
We report the first results of this study .
Women with a Karnofsky performance score of at least 60 and blood counts and serum levels of blood urea nitrogen ,  creatinine ,  and bilirubin that were within normal ranges were eligible for the study .
The initial evaluation also included chest radiography ,  cystoscopy ,  proctoscopy ,  a complete blood count ,  and measurement of liver and renal function .
External-beam radiation was delivered with anteroposterior and posteroanterior opposed beams of at least 15-MV photons or the use of four fields (anteroposterior ,  posteroanterior ,  and two lateral fields) of at least 4-MV photons .
Once treatment ended ,  patients were evaluated every three months for the first two years ,  every four months during the third year ,  every six months during the fourth and fifth years ,  and then annually .
Toxicity was assessed at the time of each evaluation with use of the Cooperative Group Common Toxicity Criteria ,  the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria ,  and the Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme of the RTOG and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer .
Disease- free survival was also compared in the two groups and was calculated from the date of study entry to the date of the first occurrence of disease progression ,  a second diagnosis of cancer ,  or death from any cause ,  or if none of these events occurred ,  to the date of the last follow-up visit .
On the basis of the results of two earlier RTOG trials ,  we predicted that the five-year survival rate for the control group (radiotherapy alone) would be 65 percent for patients with stage IB or II disease and 40 percent for patients with stage III or IVA disease .
The nominal significance level required for early reporting was origioriginally set at P=0.005 ,  but we subsequently adopted a more conservative approach ,  because it allowed the number of deaths observed to determine the nominal level required for early reporting .
Fifteen patients (4 percent) — six in the combined-therapy group and nine in the radiotherapy group — were subsequently disqualified because of failure to undergo the required evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (eight patients) ,  the presence of extrapelvic cancer (two) ,  the presence of a rare histologic subtype (one) ,  the presence of a stage IB1 tumor with no involvement of pelvic nodes (one) ,  the absence of pretreatment data (two) ,  and receipt of chemotherapy before radiotherapy (one) .
Eleven patients (3 percent) did not undergo brachytherapy ,  three patients refused ,  and eight patients did not undergo it for other reasons .
Of the 195 patients in the combination-therapy group ,  159 (81 percent) completed at least two cycles of chemotherapy ,  and 133 (68 percent) completed three cycles .
Of these ,  147 patients in the combined-therapy group (76 percent) and 122 patients in the radiotherapy group (63 percent) were alive at the time of the last analysis .
Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that overall survival rates were significantly better among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy than among those treated with radiotherapy alone (73 percent vs. 58 percent ,  P=0.004) (Table 5 and Fig. 1) .
Disease-free survivalat five years was 67 percent in the combined-therapy group and 40 percent in the radiotherapy group ,  according to Kaplan–Meier analysis (P<0.001) (Fig. 2) .
The relative likelihood of disease-free survival in the combined-therapy group ,  as compared with the radiotherapy group ,  was 0.48 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.35 to 0.66) .
The rates of distant relapse were 14 percent in the combined-therapy group and 33 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) ,  with a relative risk of relapse of 0.39 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.24 to 0.63) in the combined-therapy group .
The rate of locoregional recurrences was 19 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 35 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) ,  with a relative risk of locoregional recurrences of 0.47 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.31 to 0.71) in the combined-therapy group .
The estimated five-year survival rates according to various stratification variables are summarized in Table 5 .
For patients with stage III or IVA disease ,  the five-year disease-free survival rates were 58 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 38 percent in the radiotherapy group (P=0.13) .
Although chemotherapy  increased the hematologic toxicity ,  this effect was reversible and the incidence of late side effects was similar in the two treatment groups .
Although the group reported significant improvements in overall and disease-free survival with the addition of hydroxyurea therapy ,  the study has been criticized for the use of a low dose of radiation and the poor survival rates in both groups and because more than half of the 190 patients who were enrolled could not be evaluated .
As a result ,  the median dose was higher and the median duration of treatment was shorter than those reported in other studies .
We used a higher dose of cisplatin (75 mg per square meter) than that used with fluorouracil in the Gynecologic Oncology Group studies ,  and we also included a third cycle of chemotherapy during one of the intracavitary procedures .
In our study ,  the benefit of para-aortic radiation may have been less than that observed in an earlier RTOG trial ,  because our trial required more rigorous staging of para-aortic lymph nodes and included patients with more advanced pelvic disease .
