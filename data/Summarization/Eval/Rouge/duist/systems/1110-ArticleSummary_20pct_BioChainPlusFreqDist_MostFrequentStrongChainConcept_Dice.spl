OF the estimated 13,700 women in the United States in whom invasive cervical cancer was diagnosed in 1998 ,  nearly 5000 will ultimately die of the disease because of the inadequacies of current treatment .
In the United States ,  cervical cancer disproportionately affects women who are members of minority groups and women of low socioeconomic status ,  partly because such women tend to have insufficient access to and knowledge of screening programs for cervical cancer .
The nationwide use of such screening programs has greatly reduced the incidence of invasive cervical cancer .
Women with early cervical cancer can be successfully treated with radical surgery .
Those with a large cervical lesion at presentation or with spread to the pelvic lymph nodes or other pelvic tissues are usually treated with a combination of external-beam and intracavitary radiation .
A previous study reported improved survival among women with locally advanced cervical cancer who received prophylactic radiation to the para-aortic nodes .
To eradicate micrometastases and sensitize tumor cells to radiation ,  several studies have explored the use of radiotherapy with concomitant chemotherapy .
The results of these studies are inconclusive and have been criticized because they lacked a comparison group treated with radiation alone and because the radiation therapy used may have been deficient according to current standards .
In 1990 ,  the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) began a randomized clinical trial to compare the effects on survival of treatment with extended-field radiation and treatment with pelvic radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in patients with cervical cancer .
We report the first results of this study .
METHODS .
The radioisotopes used for low-dose-rate intracavitary radiotherapy were cesium-137 or radium-226 in 392 of 402 patients (98 percent) .
Variations were scored as minor ,  major but acceptable ,  or major and unacceptable ,  if they differed by more than 5 ,  10 ,  or 20 percent ,  respectively ,  from the specified dose of radiation or duration of treatment .
On the basis of the results of two earlier RTOG trials ,  we predicted that the five-year survival rate for the control group (radiotherapy alone) would be 65 percent for patients with stage IB or II disease and 40 percent for patients with stage III or IVA disease .
A 33 percent reduction in the death rate as a result of chemotherapy would yield an absolute improvement of approximately 10 percent in the five-year survival rate .
Interim analyses were scheduled to occur when 50 percent of the patients had been enrolled and when the enrollment goal was met .
Fifteen patients (4 percent) — six in the combined-therapy group and nine in the radiotherapy group — were subsequently disqualified because of failure to undergo the required evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (eight patients) ,  the presence of extrapelvic cancer (two) ,  the presence of a rare histologic subtype (one) ,  the presence of a stage IB1 tumor with no involvement of pelvic nodes (one) ,  the absence of pretreatment data (two) ,  and receipt of chemotherapy before radiotherapy (one) .
Radiotherapy was delivered according to the protocol or with minor deviations in 83 percent of the patients in the combined-therapy group and 84 percent of those in the radiotherapy group .
Major but acceptable treatment deviations occurred in another 1 percent and 9 percent of these groups ,  respectively .
Eleven patients (3 percent) did not undergo brachytherapy ,  three patients refused ,  and eight patients did not undergo it for other reasons .
Of the 195 patients in the combination-therapy group ,  159 (81 percent) completed at least two cycles of chemotherapy ,  and 133 (68 percent) completed three cycles .
Of these ,  147 patients in the combined-therapy group (76 percent) and 122 patients in the radiotherapy group (63 percent) were alive at the time of the last analysis .
Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that overall survival rates were significantly better among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy than among those treated with radiotherapy alone (73 percent vs. 58 percent ,  P=0.004) (Table 5 and Fig. 1) .
Disease-free survivalat five years was 67 percent in the combined-therapy group and 40 percent in the radiotherapy group ,  according to Kaplan–Meier analysis (P<0.001) (Fig. 2) .
The relative likelihood of disease-free survival in the combined-therapy group ,  as compared with the radiotherapy group ,  was 0.48 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.35 to 0.66) .
The rates of distant relapse were 14 percent in the combined-therapy group and 33 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) ,  with a relative risk of relapse of 0.39 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.24 to 0.63) in the combined-therapy group .
The rate of locoregional recurrences was 19 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 35 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) ,  with a relative risk of locoregional recurrences of 0.47 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.31 to 0.71) in the combined-therapy group .
Approximately 70 percent of the patients assigned to each group had stage IB ,  IIA ,  or IIB disease .
For patients with stage III or IVA disease ,  the five-year disease-free survival rates were 58 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 38 percent in the radiotherapy group (P=0.13) .
