No substantial improvements have beenmade in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer in the past two decades .
In addition to modifications of radiation therapy multiple studies have investigated ,  and are investigating ,  strategies that combine radiation with chemotherapy either as neoadjuvant or concurrent administration .
The results reported for trials of neoadjuvant cisplatin-containing chemotherapy prior to radiation have been disappointing with six randomized trials ,  showing no advantage in local control or survival and possibly some detrimental effect .
In vitro data suggested that the addition of infusional 5-FU to radiation therapy would enhance the radiation effect .
The attenuator was used throughout the treatment course in those treated with a box technique and for half the fractions in those treated with a parallel pair .
Twice daily treatments on days 1 to 4 and 22 to 25 were delivered at least at 6 h apart .
The ‘‘Lifetest Procedure’’ in SAS UNIX was used to compare survival curves .
Cox’s proportional hazards model was used to examine the variables which might contribute to pelvic control or survival within stratum 1 .
The number excluded in each stratum were 6 in stratum 1 ,  3 in stratum 2 ,  and 4 in stratum 3 .
Ninety-nine patients were in stratum 1 ,  of which 46 were stage IB/IIA and 53 were stage IIB .
One hundred and five were in stratum 2 ,  of which 38 were stage IIB and 63 stage IIIB .
Compliance with the planned radiation schedules was good .
Pelvic Control and Survival .
The Kaplan–Meier plots of overall disease-free survival ,  disease-free survival for each stratum ,  and disease free survival by treatment assigned are shown in Figs. 2 ,  3 ,  and4 ,  respectively .
There is no significant difference in the overall 5-year disease-free survival between the treatment arms .
Thereis a trend in favor of standard radiation and 5-FU .
The disease-free survival by treatment arm for the 99 patients in stratum 1 is shown in Fig. 5 .
There was a significant improvement in 5-year survival and disease-free survival for those treated with standard radiation and 5-FU compared to the other treatments (log rank test P 5 0.05) .
The actuarial 5-year disease-free survival was 76% compared to 65% for hyperfractionated irradiation plus 5-FU ,  58% for hyperfractionated irradiation alone ,  and 39% for standard radiation .
Similar differences were observed in pelvic control ,  but the addition of 5-FU to standard radiation resulted in a greater improvement in disease-free survival than in pelvic control .
A factorial analysis of the magnitude of the impact of differences in the radiation schedule or the addition of 5-FU on the improvements in pelvic control and disease-free survival in stratum 1 was performed .
The 5-year Kaplan–Meier disease-free survival for those irradiated without 5-FU was 48% versus 71% for those who received 5-FU (log rank P 5 0.02) (Fig. 6) .
However ,  in evaluating the importance of the contribution of the change in fractionation to the differences observed ,  there was no significant difference in the 5-year survival of those treated on standard radiation versus those treated with hyperfractionated irradiation whether or not 5-FU was used .
The dose of 5280 cGy in 33 fractions is biologically similar to the standard dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions .
It was hoped that the use of two treatments daily during the 5-FU infusion would increase any opportunity for 5-FU-radiation interaction by increasing the total amount of radiation given concurrently with 5-FU .
Stratum 2 was examined for differences in pelvic control and survival between the treatment arms and no significant differences were observed .
For those receiving standard RT ,  the pelvic control rate was 60% but the disease-free survival was only 39% .
Patients were stratified into three groups in this study because pelvic control and survival outcomes are strongly influenced by the bulk of pelvic disease ,  declining with increasing bulk .
It is therefore not surprising that significant differences in survival and pelvic control were not observed in the overall population .
It was anticipated that the magnitude of benefit might vary for each stratum .
There were too few patients (17) in stratum 3 to justify further analysis .
Within stratum 2 there was an improvement in pelvic control with the use of 5-FU but the difference was not statistically significant .
However ,  in stratum 1 constituted of patients with stage IB/IIA and those IIB tumors with medial parametrial involvement ,  a significant improvement in both pelvic control and disease-free survival in favor of standard radiation with concurrent 5-FU was observed (Figs. 5 and 6) .
The disease-free survival with standard radiation alone ,  however ,  was surprisingly low at 39% .
The benefits observed occurred in relation to the use of concurrent 5-FU rather than to the change in radiation fractionation .
Because of the small numbers in each treatment arm it was surprising to observe a significant difference .
A number of patient- and tumor-related factors were analyzed for their impact on outcome using the Cox’s proportional hazard model .
The second rationale for use of the partially hyperfractionated radiation scheme was to attempt to maximize the dose of radiation delivered during the infusion of 5-FU .
Such a benefit was not observed in this study .
The mechanism by which 5-FU exerts benefit is unknown ,  but may be simply by additivity due to its independent cytotoxic effect rather than to an interaction with radiation .
From the subset analysis of this trial we have generated the hypothesis that there may be a beneficial effect of adding concurrent infusional 5-FU to standard in patients with the disease characteristics of stratum 1 .
The number of patients is too few to recommend that concurrent infusional 5-FU with pelvic irradiation should become the standard therapy for these patients .
