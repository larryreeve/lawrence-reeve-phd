We conducted a prospective ,  randomised study to compare external and internal radiotherapy with radical hysterectomy and node dissection .
Methods .
A complete computerised plane was made ,  according to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements report no 38.8 The total dose at point A (external beam plus brachyradiotherapy) ranged from 70 Gy to 90 Gy (median 76 Gy) .
The total dose to the pelvic wall exceeded 50 Gy ,  an additional dose was administered to the parametria by external beam if necessary .
In all cases ,  a lower midline incision was made ,  which skirted the umbilicus and extended to the cephalad when indicated .
Dissection of the pelvic lymph node consisted of removal of all fatty lymph-node bearing tissue anterior ,  lateral ,  and posterior to the common , external ,  and internal iliac vessels ,  and anterior to the obturator nerve .
In cases of enlarged paraortic nodes ,  only sampling or selective procedures were done .
The secondary outcome measure was recurrence of the disease .
We used 2 test with Yates’ continuity correction to test the association between discrete variables .
We compared quantitative data by one-way analysis of variance .
We analysed the rate of complications by the actual treatment delivered to each patient so that we could assess accurately the type and cause of morbidity associated with each treatment .
Results .
We excluded these cases from the analysis .
These cases were analysed according to the original group they were allocated to (intention to treat) .
The mean age of patients in the radiotherapy group was slightly greater than that of patients in the surgery group .
Of the 145 surgery-group patients with negative lymphangiography ,  27 had nodal metastases ,  which accounted for a specificity of 95% and a sensitivity of 40% .
The distribution of pathological risk factors differed significantly according to cervical diameter ,  especially for surgical stage ,  cut-through ,  and lymph-vascular-space involvement (table 2) .
Median follow-up was 87 (range 57–120) months .
Results of univariate and multivariate analysis are shown in table 4 .
Significant factors in both univariate and multivariate analyses were cervical diameter ,  positive lymphangiography ,  and adenocarcinomatous histotype .
Discussion .
Morley and Seski’s study ,  of 446 patients with stage-Ib disease recruited between 1945 and 1975 and treated with radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy or external irradiation and brachyradiotherapy ,  reported crude 5-year survival of 87% and 83% ,  respectively .
Radical hysterectomy allows the gonadal function of at least one ovary to be saved ,  thereby avoiding the effects of early menopause in younger women .
Shortening and fibrosis of the vagina can be limited if the woman is sexually active .
The women with a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm had the most unfavourable pathological prognostic factors and were at risk of a relapse independently from any other clinical factor .
Adjuvant radiotherapy was prospectively planned in patients at high risk of relapse .
The most important clinical risk factors that could indicate benefit of combined treatments are cervical diameter and lymph node status as assessed by lymphangiography .
This finding should resolve some of the conflicting approaches to this issue.14–16 Our results suggest that the optimum candidates for primary radical surgery are women with normal ovarian function and cervical diameters of 4 cm or smaller ,  whereas radiotherapy is preferable for postmenopausal women .
An Italian prospective randomised trial of radical radiotherapy versus neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery in patients with squamous neoplasia and cervical diameters larger than 4 cm has been in progress since 1991 .
