Adjuvant chemotherapy of colorectal cancer has been tested in several randomised trials .
Liver metastases are observed at diagnosis of primary colorectal cancer in 25-30% of patients .
Patients and methods.29 patients had liver metastases diagnosed at resection and 8 had incomplete resection .
5 patients were lost to follow-up .
Results .
The group assigned perioperative portal chemotherapy had significantly higher 5-year disease-free survival than the control group (table 2) .
At median follow-up of 96 months ,  235 patients had died; 108 in the infusion group and 127 in the control group .
5-year overall survival was also higher in the infusion group (table 2) .
The infusion group had fewer local recurrences and liver metastases with or without relapses at other sites than the control group (table 4) .
Among node-negative patients ,  local relapses were less frequent in those who received infusion treatment .
Similarly ,  liver recurrences were less frequent in infusion-treated patients within the node-positive and colon-cancer subgroups .
The 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 1-9% (10/533 patients)-2.3% (6/266) in the control group and 1.5% (4/267) in the infusion group .
1 patient in each group died of myocardial infarction ,  2 patients in the control group died of refractory small-bowel obstruction ,  and 3 patients in each group died of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative septicaemia .
This trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase survival in patients with colorectal cancer .
Adjuvant portal chemotherapy was tolerated without an increase in complications compared with untreated patients .
We did find ,  however ,  a consistent reduction of all kinds of tumour recurrences that resulted in a significant advantage in overall survival and disease-free survival for patients  treated with adjuvant portal infusion ,  confirming previous findings .
Most were multicentre trials and some excluded patients with rectal cancer .
Two as yet unpublished meta-analyses of all randomised trials comparing portal adjuvant chemotherapy with a no-treatment control group have been conducted by the European Organization on Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Oxford Colorectal Cancer Cooperative Group .
Both analyses are based on data for more than 3000 patients; the results show a  statistically significant overall and disease-free survival advantage for patients who received portal adjuvant therapy .
Our randomised three-arm study (control vs portal vs systemic adjuvant therapy) was carried out between 1987 and 1993 in 770 patients .
Analyses of haematological toxic effects and postoperative complications show more side-effects in the systemic treatment group than in the portal or control groups .
