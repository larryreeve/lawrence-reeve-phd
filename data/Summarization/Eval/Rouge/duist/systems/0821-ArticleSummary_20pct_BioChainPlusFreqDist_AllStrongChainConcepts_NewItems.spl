The two drugs have been used together clinically on empirical grounds for some time ,  particularly in the treatment of breast cancer ,  but data from experimental tumors in vivo and in vitro document both synergistic and antagonistic interactions .
The sequential exposure of L1210 cells to MTX and then to 5-FU was shown to increase the intracellular concentration of 5-FU ribonucleotides ,  a potential mechanism of synergy .
Patients eligible for this study had measurable or evaluable advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck , adenocarcinoma of the colon ,  rectum or stomach ,  or SCC of other primary site (Table I) .
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. leukocyte count >3.0 x 10/L ,  platelet count > 100 x 10/L and adequate renal function (scrum creatinine <90 umol/L or creatinine clearance > 1.0 mL/sec) were required .
Patients received oral or IV bicarbonate to ensure a urine pH of at least 7.0 at the time of MTX administration and for 24 hours thereafter ,  then oral folinic acid rescue (FAR) for eight doses of 15 mg each 6 hours commencing 24 hours after the MTX .
Patients who showed complete or partial response received a further four courses at two-week intervals ,  while those with stable or progressive disease discontinued chemotherapy .
Statistical analysis used BMDP statistical software to prepare and compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves (program BMDPIL) for the group as a whole and for subgroups by primary site ,  treatment sequence ,  performance status ,  sex ,  age group ,  and response to therapy .
Among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  disease stage expressed as TNM separately and as stage grouping ,  using standard definitions of the American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging and- End Result reporting were also examined as possible prognostic factors for response and survival .
Chi square and Fisher's exact tests of the significance of differences in proportions responding to each treatment sequence were performed using standard formulas .
Variables included in the Cox models for all patients with head and neck cancer were treatment group ,  prior radiotherapy ,  performance status ,  sex ,  and prior surgery .
For previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  stage expressed as either stage group or as T ,  N ,  and M stage ,  separately and with two and three-way interactions were also included .
Altogether ,  108 patients were entered ,  including 70 with head and neck cancer of whom 49 had received no prior chemotherapy ,  no radiotherapy ,  and no surgical treatment beyond diagnostic biopsy .
Four patients ,  two on each treatment sequence ,  died of treatment-related complications (sepsis in two patients ,  diarrhea in one ,  and aspiration pneumonia in one patient) ,  and a further patient developed prolonged neurologic toxicity with coma but recovered fully .
Even if the most extreme case is assumed and all four nonevaluable patients regarded as nonresponders ,  the difference was still not significant (P = .06 ,  Fisher's exact test ,  with no allowance for multiple comparisons) .
Cox model multivariate analysis showed that ECOG performance status at study entry was the most significant prognostic factor for survival duration (P < .001) ,  and that ,  among the 70 patients with head and neck cancer ,  when allowance was made for performance status ,  a survival difference in favor of the "reverse" FM sequence emerged (P < .025) .
Other factors including stage ,  sex ,  prior radiotherapy ,  and prior surgery were not significant .
Biochemical and cell culture results from this laboratory suggested that the sequence-dependent synergy observed in vitro between MTX and 5-FU was reduced in the presence of 1-3 )umol/L hypoxanthine ,  a physiologic level found in human plasma .
