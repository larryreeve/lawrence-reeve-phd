Intestinal anastomosis has been successfully performed for more than 150 years using a variety of techniques ,  materials ,  and devices .
METHODS .
Patients were also excluded if the surgeon did not believe that either technique could be used because of technical concerns such as edema or scarring .
Randomization was performed using random permuted blocks of size 10 .
All layers of the bowel wall except the mucosa were incorporated .
The time recorded for construction of the anastomosis began with the placement of the first stitch and ended with cutting the excess material from the last stitch .
Calculations of the length of stay used the number of patients for the denominator .
Each packet of polypropylene suture cost $4.61 .
Data were analyzed based on the intention-to-treat principle .
Continuous data were analyzed using the Student t test .
RESULTS .
For six patients who required more than one anastomosis ,  the same method was used for each anastomosis .
Four patients in the study died ,  but no deaths were related to the anastomosis .
DISCUSSION .
In fact ,  the only technique that has been unequivocally demonstrated to be unacceptable is the everted anastomosis .
Further ,  most of the anastomoses in this study were performed by residents ,  who were often unfamiliar with the technique or were performing their first intestinal anastomosis .
This ,  they argue ,  may also explain the rarity of stenoses of the suture line .
It is therefore difficult to make definitive statements regarding the relative risk of uncommon outcomes ,  such as anastomotic leakage .
To detect a significant difference in leakage rates based on our data ,  a power analysis indicated that 1,500 patients would be required .
However ,  our results and those in the literature are consistent and reassuring .
