ALTHOUGH much progress has been made in the early detection and control of carcinoma of the cervix since the introduction of  the Papanicolau test ,  it is estimated that about 13,500 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 1990 in  the United States with 6,000 patients dying from the disease .
The incidence is even more pronounced in developing countries  where carcinoma of the cervix is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in females ,   with the majority of the patients  presenting with advanced disease .
While surgery and radiotherapy (RT) are equally effective in early-stage disease ,  radiation  therapy has been the primary treatment modality for stage III disease ,  with 5-year survival rates between 30% to 45% being  reported.4-8 Attempts to improve these results ,  including the use of hypoxic cell sensitizers ,  hyperbaric oxygen therapy , '0  and neutron therapy" have met with limited or no success .
Patients also needed to have adequate medullary reserve (WBC Ž 4,000/IpL ,  platelet count >  100,000/p.L) and normal renal (BUN < 8.9 mmol/L ,  creatinine < 130 Rimol/L ,  creatinine clearance > 1.17 mL/s) and liver  (alkaline phosphatase < 110 U/L ,  bilirubin < 21 pimol/L) function .
Staging evaluation included a complete medical history and  physical examination ,  cystoscopy ,  chest x-ray ,  bipedal lymphangiogram ,  intravenous (IV) pyelogram ,  complete blood counts ,  and  biochemistries .
In  the CT + RT group ,  11 refused further therapy ,  including pelvic RT ,  after only one cycle of CT ,  and two others were found to  have abnormal renal function after randomization and before commencement of treatment .
Three in the RT arm refused further  treatment after only a few fractions of irradiation were delivered .
Treatment Regimens .
Radiation therapy was delivered using an 18 MeV photon linear accelerator .
The superior limit of the radiation field  was the L5-S1 junction ,  the lower limit wasthe caudal pole of obturator foramen ,  and the lateral boundaries were 1.5 cm  beyond the lymph nodes as demonstrated on lymphangiography .
Following external-beam irradiation ,  a single low-dose rate  intracavitary application was performed .
Chemotherapy consisted of bleomycin 15 U intramuscularly (IM) every 12 hours from days 1 to 4 (total dose ,  120 U) ,   vincristine 1 mg/m2 IV on day 1 ,  mitomycin 10 mg/im 2 IV on day 1 ,  and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1 ,  given on an outpatient  basis every 3 weeks for three cycles .
Potassium chloride at 20 mEq/L and magnesium sulfate were added as needed .
Six months after activation of the study ,  after nine patients had been treated with CT ,  the bleomycin dose was reduced to 15  U IM every 12 hours from day 1 to day 3 (total dose ,  90 U) ,  and after the first year ,  cisplatin administration was changed  from day 1 to day 4 .
The third bleomycin cycle was either withheld or the bleomycin dose was  reduced in 15% of the patients ,  mainly because of severe skin hyperpigmentation .
Pelvic failure was defined as disease recurring in  the true pelvis including central and parametrial failure .
All patients were observed to determine the efficiency of the combined therapy by comparing overall survival ,  rate of local  control ,  incidence of distant metastases ,  and toxicity between treatment regimens .
Blood  counts were performed weekly and the lowest granulocyte and platelet counts recorded .
Although not a requirement of the  study ,  attempts were made to keep the hemoglobin level > 120 g/L during pelvic irradiation .
Late complications were graded as  per the morbidity grading system suggested by Pilepich et al , 2 which takes into consideration the impact of the complication  on the patient performance and/or life-style and the required treatment for such complications (Table 2) .
Patients were stratified by  age (< 50 years v > 50 years) ,  extensiveness of parametrial involvement (unilateral v bilateral) ,  and lymphangiogram nodal  findings (negative v positive) .
We planned to accrue 60 patients into each treatment arm ,  which would produce a power of 80%  and detect an improvement of 25 % in survival with the combined modality treatment at the a = 0.05 level (two-sided test) .
Seven patients were not included in response assessment in the combined modality group ,  four patients who died  of CT complications ,  two who died of metastatic disease ,  all of them before commencement of RT ,  and one other patient whosepelvic disease progressed during CT and who received palliative irradiation only because of poor general condition .
Evaluation of tumor response by pelvic examination following therapy for advanced cervical cancer is a subjective and  imprecise method of assessment .
The cisplatin treatment day was then changed from day 1 to  day 4 but yet another patient developed the same problem (one of 12 treated patients) .
This study was designed with the objective of answering the question of whether neoadjuvant BOMP chemotherapy is effective in  stage III B carcinoma of the cervix .
Except for two patients ,  all others had received previous treatment (CT in two ,  pelvic RT in 11 ,  and major  surgery in three) .
Although 25.5% of the patients achieved a CR following three cycles of BOMP and 47% of the CT + RT group obtained a CR at the  end of RT ,  the 5-year overall survival was significantly inferior in the CT + RT group than in the control arm (39% v 21% ,  P  = .02) .
It cannot be accounted for by patient  selection as both groups were well balanced for the wellknown prognostic factors in stage III carcinoma of the cervix.4'24-27  More importantly ,  all patients in the CT + RT arm completed pelvic RT ,  as defined by the protocol guidelines ,  and therefore ,   inadequate irradiation dosage cannot explain the poorer results .
Furthermore ,  even if we exclude the patients who experienced  treatment-related death ,  the survival in the BOMP group remains significantly inferior (39% v 25%) .
It is a subjective evaluation that frequently depends on the ability of the investigator to differentiate  between residual local disease or treatment-induced parametrial fibrosis .
Recently ,  Chambers et al also reported a high incidence of pulmonary toxicity in patients receiving BOMP CT for gynecologic  squamous cell carcinoma .
Two  other studies reported a 14% incidence of pulmonary toxicity with one fatal drug-related event occurring in each .
