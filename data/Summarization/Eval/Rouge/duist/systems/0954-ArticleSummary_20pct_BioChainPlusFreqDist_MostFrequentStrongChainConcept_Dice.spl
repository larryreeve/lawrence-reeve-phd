Additional concern was raised by data suggesting that irradiated patients have reduced survival rates ,  due to either immune suppression or cardiac complications .
The radiation therapy was administered between the fourth and fifth cycles of chemotherapy .
Significance levels ,  estimates of relative risk ,  and 95 percent confidence intervals were calculated with a proportional-hazards  regression model .
Eleven patients (3.5 percent) were lost to follow-up — three (1.9 percent) from the chemotherapy group and eight (4.9 percent) from the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group .
Of the 164 patients randomly assigned to chemotherapy and radiotherapy ,  12 did not receive radiotherapy and were treated with chemotherapy alone (7 declined radiotherapy ,  3 had metastases before radiotherapy ,  and 2 had postsurgical complications) .
Eight patients randomly assigned to chemotherapy had radiotherapy at their own request or that of their physicians .
In the group treated with chemotherapy plus radiotherapy ,  79 of 164 patients had recurrences — locoregional ,  systemic ,  or both — as compared with 97 of 154 patients in the group given chemotherapy alone .
These values translate into an overall reduction of 33 percent in the rate of recurrence of breast cancer (relative risk ,  0.67 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.50 to 0.90 ,  P 0.007) ,  with an improvement of 17 percentage points in disease-free survival at the 15-year followup (Fig. 1) .
There was an overall reduction of 34 percent in the rate of systemic recurrence (relative risk ,  0.66 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.49 to 0.89 ,  P 0.006) in the group treated with combined therapy (75 of 164 patients vs. 94 of 154 patients in the group treated only with chemotherapy) ,  and a 17-percentage-point improvement in systemic disease-free survival (Fig. 2) .
The rate of locoregional recurrence was reduced by 56 percent (relative risk ,  0.44 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.26 to 0.77 ,  P 0.003) in the group given chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (19 events ,  vs. 36 events in the group treated with chemotherapy only) ,  for an absolute improvement of 20 percent in survival free of local disease .
There were 66 deaths in the group given the combined treatment and 78 deaths in the chemotherapy group ,  for a 26 percent reduction in overall mortality at 15 years (relative risk ,  0.74 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.53 to 1.02 ,  P 0.07) and an 8 percent improvement in overall survival (Table 2 and Fig. 4) .
This study of premenopausal women with breast cancer demonstrates that locoregional radiotherapy reduces the rates of locoregional and systemic relapses and the chance of dying from breast cancer .
The meta-analysis performed by the Early Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group , 1 which analyzed all the randomized radiation trials begun before 1985 ,  found a 67 percent reduction in rates of locoregional relapse (P 0.001) and a 6 percent reduction in mortality from breast cancer (P 0.03) ,  but no improvement in overall survival .
Of these ,  only the Danish study found that radiotherapy had a benefit of a magnitude similar to that in our trial ,  and there was a significant survival benefit in favor of radiotherapy (P 0.001) .
The patients in that study were similar to those in our cohort ,  there was a large and homogeneous group of premenopausal ,  node-positive patients treated with chemotherapy and five-field radiotherapy .
The other eight studies were notsimilar to ours or the Danish trial ,  either because the number of randomized premenopausal patients was small or because the radiotherapy techniques or the chemotherapy schedules were heterogeneous .
The Stockholm trial also provides evidence that locoregional radiotherapy in node-positive patients decreases the risk of systemic metastases .
In node-positive patients ,  adding locoregional radiotherapy may be essential to prevent secondary dissemination from the residual locoregional metastatic disease ,  and it could increase the potential for cure .
Four randomized trials comparing breast irradiation with no irradiation in patients who underwent conservative surgery showed significant reductions in the rate of relapse in the breast but no effect on systemic recurrences or overall survival .
