Statistical analysis used BMDP statistical software to prepare and compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves (program BMDPIL) for the group as a whole and for subgroups by primary site ,  treatment sequence ,  performance status ,  sex ,  age group ,  and response to therapy .
Variables included in the Cox models for all patients with head and neck cancer were treatment group ,  prior radiotherapy ,  performance status ,  sex ,  and prior surgery .
For previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  stage was included either as stage group or as TNM stage separately .
The remaining nine patients had metastatic or recurrent SCC of other primary site .
Four patients ,  two on each treatment sequence ,  died of treatment-related complications (sepsis in two patients ,  diarrhea in one ,  and aspiration pneumonia in one patient) ,  and a further patient developed prolonged neurologic toxicity with coma but recovered fully .
Two patients on each treatment sequence were withdrawn from treatment because of severe but nonlethal toxicity .
No significant differences in toxicity according to the treatment sequence were observed (Table 2) .
Both treatment sequences were effective in head and neck cancer ,  producing an overall major response rate (complete and partial) of 46% of all entered patients ,  including 52% (95% confidence limits ,  39%-65%) of evaluable patients .
Responses were seen in 53% of all entered previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  including 58% (95% confidence limits ,  40%-70%) of those evaluable for response .
This was most extreme among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer: of this subgroup 65% responded to the sequence of MF ,  while 39% of entered patients including 47% of those evaluable for response ,  responded to the reverse FM sequence (P = .18; Fisher's exact test) .
Among patients with colorectal cancer ,  responses were seen in 33% of all entered patients ,  including 40% (95% confidence limit ,  19%- 64%) of those evaluable for response .
The median survival of colorectal cancer patients from start of treatment was only 4.6 months .
No significant sequence-dependent differences in response rate or survival duration were observed among the patients with colorectal cancer .
Responses were seen among the small number of patients with other cancers (Table 3) .
In the small number of patients with colorectal cancer we observed a response rate of 33% (40% of evaluable patients) ,  a figure somewhat higher than that usually seen after 5-FU as a single agent ,  but the 95% confidence limits for this rate (19%-64%) emphasize that this could be a chance observation .
The median survival from the start of chemotherapy was short (4.6 months) with no significant difference between the two treatment sequences in response rate or survival duration (Table 3) .
