Fluorouracil can be used as first-line or second-line therapy and a different regimen of fluorouracil can be administered as second-line treatment if first-line treatment fails .
Phase III studies of patients whose disease had not responded to first-line fluorouracil ,  or patients whose disease had progressed after first-line fluorouracil treatment ,  showed increased survival times in patients given irinotecan compared with those receiving best supportive care or high-dose fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone by continuous infusion .
From May ,  1997 ,  to February ,  1998 ,  we enrolled patients who met the following eligibility criteria ,  histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum ,  age 18-75 years ,  WHO performance status of 2 or less and life expectancy of more than 3 months ,  haemoglobin 100 g/L or more ,  absolute neutrophil count 2.0 10/L ,  platelets 150 10/L or more ,  creatinine 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal ,  total bilirubin 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal ,  aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 3.0 or less times the upper limit of normal (if liver metastases present ,  1.5 or less times for bilirubin and 5.0 or less times for aspartate and alanine aminotransferases) ,  and no previous (other than adjuvant) chemotherapy ,  finished more than 6 months before randomisation .
We needed to include 338 evaluable patients to show a significant difference in response rate between treatment groups ,  assuming response rates of 35% in the no-irinotecan group and 50% in the irinotecan group ,  by use of two-tailed X tests (a=0.05 ,  power 0.80) .
We analysed the intention-to-treat population and calculated response rates for the intention-to-treat and evaluable populations.  2 tests were used to compare categorical variables between treatment groups .
The first group included countries that had recruited more than 30 patients (UK ,  Spain ,  France ,  Czech Republic ,  Germany ,  and Austria) ,  the second countries that had recruited 10.30 patients (Belgium ,  Israel ,  South Africa ,  Switzerland ,  and Italy) ,  and the third countries that had recruited fewer than ten patients (Greece ,  Portugal ,  and the Netherlands) .
We tested the nine following variables ,  sex ,  WHO performance status (<2 and <=2) ,  weight loss (<=5% and >5%) ,  number of organs involved (<3 and <=3) ,  primary tumour site (colon or rectum) ,  organ involvement (liver only or other sites) ,  time from first diagnosis to first metastasis (0.3 ,  >3-12 ,  >12 months) ,  previous surgery ,  and previous adjuvant therapy .
For time to progression ,  Cox's proportional hazards modelling was used ,  with the following variables ,  sex ,  age (<58 and <=58 years) ,  WHO performance status (<2 and >= 2) ,  weight loss (<=5% and >5%) ,  number of organs involved (<3 and >=3) ,  primary tumour site (colon or rectum) ,  liver involvement ,  lymph-node involvement ,  time from first diagnosis to first metastasis (0-3 ,  >3.12 ,  >12 months) ,  previous surgery ,  previous adjuvant therapy ,  time from first diagnosis and first infusion (<9 and <=9 months) .
A higher proportion of women were assigned fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone than the irinotecan regimen ,  and the rectum was the primary tumour site in a higher proportion of patients in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group .
Tumour characteristics and history in the two groups were comparable ,  except for previous surgery ,  since 89% of patients had had surgery in the irinotecan group and 95% in the no-irinotecan group .
Time to progression was longer in the irinotecan than in the noirinotecan group (median 6.7 [0+.13.8+] vs 4.4 group and the no-irinotecan group ,  33.1% (95% CI 25.5-41.4) and 21.0% (14.6-28.6 ,  p=0.021) ,  median time to progression was 6.5 (range 0+.13.2) months and 3.7 (0+.13.1+) months (p=0.001) ,  and median survival was 17.4 (0.4-28.3+) months and 13.0 (0.5-27.6+) months .
The effect of treatment was significant (p<0.001) ,  the Survival in the irinotecan group was significantly longer hazard ratio for response was 2.6 times higher in the than in the no-irinotecan group (median 17.4 [0.4-28.4+] irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group ,  given the same degree of weight loss at baseline and the same time between first diagnosis and first metastasis .
Combination of irinotecan with fluorouracil and calcium folinate significantly increased response rates ,  time to progression ,  and survival .
The survival advantage was reached ,  despite a higher proportion of patients receiving further chemotherapy in the no-irinotecan group (58.3 vs 39.4%) .
This study population was large (385 patients treated) ,  and the patients were representative of candidates for first-line chemotherapy in clinical practice ,  except that an unexpectedly high proportion of them had synchronous metastases at baseline and ,  consequently ,  a relatively low proportion of them had had previous adjuvant chemotherapy .
Another phase III study that compared irinotecan combined with bolus fluorouracil and fluorouracil alone consistently provided significantly higher response rates (33 vs 18% ,  p<0.001) and median time to treatment failure (5.0 vs 3.8 months ,  p<0.05) in the irinotecan group .
