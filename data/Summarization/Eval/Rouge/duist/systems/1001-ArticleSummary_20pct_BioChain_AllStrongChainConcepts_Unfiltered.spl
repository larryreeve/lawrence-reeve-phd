Purpose ,  As previously shown ,  antibody treatment increased survival of patients with resected colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C .
Primary end points were overall survival and disease-free interval .
After 7 years of follow-up evaluation ,  treatment had reduced overall mortality by 32% (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P < .01 ,  log-rank ,  P = .01) and decreased the recurrence rate by 23% (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P < .04 ,  log-rank ,  P = .07) .
The intentionto-treat analysis gave a significant effect for overall survival (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P < .01 ,  log-rank ,  P = .02) and disease-free survival (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P = .02 ,  log-rank ,  P = .1 1) .
While distant metastases were significantly reduced (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P = .004 ,  log-rank ,  P = .004) ,  local relapses were not (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P = .65 ,  log-rank ,  P = .52) .
This differential effect of 17-1A antibody on disseminated isolated tumor cells versus occult local satellites may explain the increased significance seen in the overall survival .
The therapeutic effect is maintained after 7 years of follow-up evaluation .
Wondering what the characteristic features of these trials were ,  one notes that two of these trials ,  one in lymphoma and one in breast carcinoma ,  2 had been performed with engineered antibodies ,  ie ,  either human/ murine chimeric or human complementanly defining regious (CDR)-grafted mmunoglobulins respectively ,  while the third stands out because of the target and end point used .
In contrast to other trials aimed at patients with larger metastatic tumor masses and using regression or shrinkage as the end point ,  this one on colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C required microscopically complete resection of the primary tumor for patients to be admitted.3 As the primary end point ,  overall-survival was determined at 5 years .
Now ,  after a median observation time of 7 years ,  with only four of 185 patients monitored for less than 5 years ,  the study has matured and continues to demonstrate a significant benefit with regard to survival .
The multicenter study consisted of six academic centers in former West Germany A total of 189 patients were randomized ,  with the first patient entered in May 1985 and the last in Apnl 1990 The study was closed in December 1992 ,  and we present here the final status with median follow-up data of 7 years Eligible patients were required to have histologically confirmed adenocarcmoma of colon or the rectum with spread to regional lymph nodes (Dukes' C or International Unimon Agamst Cancer [UICC] stage III) In addition ,  hlstopathologic confirmation of curative resection (R0) was secured Radical tumor resection was performed by a standardized technique agreed upon by all participating centers When located within 15 cm of the anal verge ,  a tumor was classified as rectal carcinoma Patients were less than 70 years old and had a Karnofsky index greater than 50% Eleven of 99 patients randomized to treatment refused their treatment assignment ,  but were otherwise considered eligible for the study .
After confirmation of histology and R0 resection of lymph node metastasis ,  patients were randomized into two groups one received 17-lA treatment ,  whereas the other served as observation controls .
All patients were stratified according to Zelen 8 by the following factors participating center ,  sex ,  location of tumor ,  stage (Dukes' Cl or C2 equivalent to pN1 or pN2-3) ,  number of affected lymph nodes ,  and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level before surgery (Table 1) In the treated arm ,  more patients had pT2 and pT3 tumors ,  and fewer had pT4 tumors However ,  treated patients appeared to have had higher numbers of involved lymph nodes (pN2) and tumors of less differentiated histology (grade 3) .
However ,  a Fishers' exact test ,  companng the distnbutlon of patients according to all prognostic variables ,  showed no significant differences Randomlzation before consent was performed and evaluated according to Zelen 9 On approval by legal experts in 1985 ,  this procedure was accepted by the ethical review board Statistical analyses were performed according to SAS (Statistical Analysis System ,  Cary ,  NC) To test for potential selection bias in the study ,  a retrospective analysis was performed at Medizimnische Hochschule Hannover on 67 Dukes' C colorectal cancer patients selected from 107 patients seen between 1980 and 1985 They fulfilled the entry criteria for the 17-1A clinical trial and were monitored for at least 5 years each The survival analysis was performed by the Instutut fur Medlzinische Informatlk und Blomathematlk ,  Umversltat Essen The overall survival according to Kaplan-Meier curve is nearly identical to the control group of the 17-1A trial (log-rank ,  P = 97) ,  thus ,  this historical control does not show any selection bias .
A documented histologic or radiologic diagnosis of disease was  required to confirm local or distant recurrence ,  whereas abnormal CEA values were not used as evidence of relapse .
Four patients ,  two in each group (2.1%) ,  were lost to follow-up evaluation from the start and have not been included in the trial .
The main cause of ineligibihty (12 cases) was erroneous staging .
Thus ,  eight patients had Dukes' B ,  four had Dukes' D ,  three were older than 70 years ,  one presented with polyposis coh ,  and one patient had residual tumor (R2) after surgery .
One patient had a competing neoplasm and one patient received postoperative radiochemotherapy .
Since the 5-year follow-up evaluation ,  four additional deaths occurred m the treated group and nine additional deaths in the control group .
Thus ,  treatment with antibody led to a relative reduction of mortality by 32% (hazards ratio ,  0.57 ,  95% confidence interval ,  8% to 51%) .
The KaplanMeier survival curves (Fig 1A) showed a significant benefit for patients who received antibody over those who did not receive treatment (P < .01 with Cox's proportional hazard model corrected for influence of prognostic variables ,  and P = .01 with log-rank test for the univariate analysis) .
Among all deaths recorded ,  six patients died without recurrence or secondary colorectal cancer and one observed patient of the control group died of secondary colon carcinoma ,  which was not counted as a recurrence .
As most of the relapse events occur in the first 2 years after resection ,  it is not surprising that the pattern of relapses did not show gross changes during the sixth and seventh years .
There were no late treatment-related fatalities or life-threatening conditions ,  or any evidence for chronic drug-related side effects .
As the 7-year median follow-up data confirm the previously reported 5-year findings ,  the conclusion seems warranted that antibody treatment improves the chances of curatively operated patients .
Thus ,  irradiation was applied to 11 patients of this group (two received preoperative ,  four preoperative radiation and postoperative radiochemotherapy ,  and five postoperative radiation only) .
Interestingly ,  in the most recent report (median follow-up time ,  6.5 years) ,  adjuvant therapy with fluorouracil plus levamisol administered to patients with Dukes' C colon cancer had only a minimal effect on local recurrences .
Therefore ,  the less pronounced chemotherapeutic effect on local relapses may be due to the difference in patient populations .
In other studies that also targeted a monoclonal antibody to an organ-specific ,  rather than a tumor-specific antigen ,  the tumor-specific biologic action induced by the applied antibody had been ascribed to the faster elimination of the bound antibody from normal than from malignant cells .
One of these trials ,  performed in Europe and Israel ,  includes a confirmatory arm with antibody as single treatment ,  with the other two arms applying chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus antibody ,  respectively .
