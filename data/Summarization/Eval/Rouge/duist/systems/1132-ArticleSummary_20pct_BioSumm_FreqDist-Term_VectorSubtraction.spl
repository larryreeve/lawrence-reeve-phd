ALTHOUGH much progress has been made in the early detection and control of carcinoma of the cervix since the introduction of  the Papanicolau test ,  it is estimated that about 13,500 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 1990 in  the United States with 6,000 patients dying from the disease .
Here we report the results of this study .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Patient Entry Criteria and Evaluation .
Computed tomographic scans were not routinely performed .
No patient underwent lymph node biopsy to confirm the radiologic  findings .
Of these ,  16 were excluded from this analysis .
Patient characteristics are outlined  in Table 1 .
Treatment Regimens .
Both fields were treated on each day of treatment .
This RT regimen was used for both  groups .
Dexamethasone and metoclopramide were  used as antiemetics .
Response Criteria .
End Points .
Toxicity of CT was assessed before each course .
Statistical Analysis .
Patients were randomly allocated to the two treatment arms by drawing cards in sealed envelopes .
Actuarial survival curves were compared by the log-rank method .
Comparisons of variables between groups  were based on the X2 test .
RESULTS .
No patient was lost to follow-up .
The overall 5-year actuarial  survival for the two groups is shown in Fig 1 .
Median survivals were 25 months in the RT arm and 10.5 months in the CT + RT .
The 5-year  survival rates for the complete responders were 57% and 36% for the RT and CT + RT groups ,  respectively .
Toxicity .
Diarrhea was the main complication of pelvic  irradiation ,  seen in eight patients (15.5%) on RT and 11 (34%) on CT + RT .
Late complications are shown in Table 7 and consisted of proctitis ,  cystitis ,  fistula ,  and vaginal stenosis .
During  atheterization ,  her bladder was perforated .
DISCUSSION .
This may explain why in spite of a satisfactory rate of response following neoadjuvant CT ,  there was no  improvement in local tumor control ,  and survival was adversely affected .
Thus ,  a PR or even a CR could therefore  be of questionable value in determining therapeutic effectiveness ,  as tumor masses would be still regressing while the  subclinical clonogenic cell repopulation is accelerating .
Of these ,  57% remain alive with no evidence of disease  progression .
Recently ,   comparisons between computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have suggested that the latter might become an  important method in evaluating response to treatment .
