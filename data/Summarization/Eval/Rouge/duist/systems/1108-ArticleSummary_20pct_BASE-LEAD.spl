THE American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics define stage IB cervical cancer as invasive cancer that is confined to the cervix ,  with a depth of more than 5 mm and a width of more than 7 mm. In patients with large stage IB cervical cancers ,  local control and survival are poorer than in patients with smaller stage I cancers ,  whether treated by surgery or irradiation .
The optimal treatment of large stage IB cervical cancer has been a source of controversy since the late 1960s .
In a previous randomized trial of combined external and intracavitary irradiation alone or followed by extrafascial hysterectomy ,  the Gynecologic Oncology Group found that hysterectomy did not improve survival ,  but it did significantly reduce the rate of relapse in the pelvic region (unpublished data) .
Several phase 2 studies have reported that concomitant treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy results in faster and more complete responses and better survival than expected with radiotherapy alone .
We elected to test this combination in a phase 3 trial to determine whether concurrent weekly treatment with cisplatin during radiotherapy would improve progression-free survival and survival in women with large “bulky , ” or barrel-shaped ,  stage IB cervical cancers .
METHODS .
Patients .
Women of any age with biopsy-proved primary squamous-cell carcinoma ,  adenocarcinoma ,  or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix of stage IB (exophytic or expansile barrel-shaped tumors with a minimal diameter of 4 cm) were eligible for the study .
Inaddition ,  patients could have no radiographic evidence of lymphadenopathy on computed tomographic scanning or lymphangiography ,  and in those with enlarged or suspicious-appearing lymph nodes ,  no evidence of cancer on fine-needle aspiration or histologic evaluation .
Extraperitoneal surgical staging of lymph nodes was optional .
Patients with histologic evidence of lymph-node involvementwere not eligible ,  nor were those who had previously received radiotherapy or chemotherapy or those with a history of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer .
All patients were required to have a Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status of 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  or 3 (equivalent to Karnofsky performance scores of 90 or 100 ,  70 or 80 ,  50 or 60 ,  and 30 or 40 ,  respectively) and adequate bone marrow ,  renal function ,  and hepatic function .
Patients were excluded from the study if they were thought to be unable to complete the planned course of therapy or the follow-up evaluations .
In addition ,  patients had to be medically suitable for hysterectomy .
The institutions that participated in the study are listed in the Appendix .
Written informed consent was obtained before entry into the study ,  fulfilling all institutional ,  state ,  and federal regulations .
Radiotherapy .
All patients were scheduled to undergo external irradiation ,  intracavitary brachytherapy ,  and extrafascial hysterectomy ,  with half the patients randomly assigned to receive weekly intravenous infusions of cisplatin during the period of radiotherapy .
The prescribed regimen of radiotherapy was identical in both groups .
Pelvic radiation was delivered with the four-field technique with x-ray accelerators of at least 4-MV photons at a distance of at least 100 cm. The treatment field was set to extend 3 cm beyond the known extent of disease and to encompass iliac and lower common iliac lymph nodes .
Fractions of 1.8 to 2.0 Gy were delivered 5 days a week over a period of 4 1/2 to 5 weeks ,  for a total dose of 45 Gy .
External irradiation was withheld if the white-cell count fell below 1000 per cubic millimeter and was resumed once the count rose above that level .
Low-dose brachytherapy was performed in one or two intracavitary applications after the completion of pelvic radiotherapy .
Standard Fletcher–Suit or Henschke applicators were used .
The dose to point A (a reference location 2 cm lateral and 2 cm superior to the cervical os) was 30 Gy ,  for a cumulative dose of 75 Gy ,  and the cumulative dose to point B (the pelvic wall) was 55 Gy .
Chemotherapy .
Cisplatin was given intravenously once a week at a dose of 40 mg per square meter of body-surface area ,  with the total dose not to exceed 70 mg per week .
A maximum of six doses of cisplatin was given .
