In a previous randomized trial of combined external and intracavitary irradiation alone or followed by extrafascial hysterectomy ,  the Gynecologic Oncology Group found that hysterectomy did not improve survival ,  but it did significantly reduce the rate of relapse in the pelvic region (unpublished data) .
We estimated that 173 patients were needed in each treatment group in order to be able to detect a 40 percent decrease in the recurrence rate in the group given radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
The design called for a final analysis when 56 events (recurrences or deaths) had occurred in patients receiving the control regimen (radiotherapy alone) and provided the study with a statistical power of 80 percent with use of the log-rank test and a one-sided significance level of 0.05 .
Two scheduled interim analyses were conducted during the enrollment phase of the trial ,  the first was conducted after 29 recurrences had been reported ,  and the second after 47 recurrences had been reported .
Adjustment for these factors had no significant effect on the differences between the groups in survival and progression-free survival .
In the earlier Gynecologic Oncology Group study that assessed the value of extrafascial hysterectomy after radiotherapy ,  surgery was associated with a significant reduction in the rate of relapses in the pelvic region ,  but the overall risk of recurrence was not significantly reduced (relative risk ,  0.76 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.52 to 1.12) and there was no significant difference in survival (relative risk of death ,  0.91) .
The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment ,  but they share a common result ,  all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin .
