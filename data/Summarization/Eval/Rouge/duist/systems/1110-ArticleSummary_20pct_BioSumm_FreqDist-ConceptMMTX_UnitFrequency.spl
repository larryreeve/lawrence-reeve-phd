In the United States ,  cervical cancer disproportionately affects women who are members of minority groups and women of low socioeconomic status ,  partly because such women tend to have insufficient access to and knowledge of screening programs for cervical cancer .
In 1990 ,  the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) began a randomized clinical trial to compare the effects on survival of treatment with extended-field radiation and treatment with pelvic radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in patients with cervical cancer .
Women were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria ,  disease outside the pelvic area or spread to para-aortic lymph nodes ,  a prior cancer other than cutaneous basal-cell carcinoma ,  medical contraindications to chemotherapy ,  a rare histologic subtype ,  and prior hysterectomy or transperitoneal staging procedure for cervical cancer ,  pelvic radiotherapy ,  or systemic chemotherapy .
Patients who completed the pretreatment evaluation and met all eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to receive extended field radiotherapy or radiotherapy to the pelvic region with concurrent treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil .
For patients who were assigned to receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy ,  the treatment field extended from the space between L4 and L5 to the midpubis or to a line 4 cm below the most distal vaginal or cervical site of disease .
The first intracavitary treatment was performed before or during external-beam radiotherapy ,  and additional external-beam therapy was delivered with a midline block .
To avoid treatment delays ,  intracavitary insertions were performed without chemotherapy if a patient had a granulocyte count of less than 1500 per cubic millimeter and a platelet count of less than 100,000 per cubic millimeter .
Once treatment ended ,  patients were evaluated every three months for the first two years ,  every four months during the third year ,  every six months during the fourth and fifth years ,  and then annually .
Radiotherapy records ,  including data concerning external-beam fields ,  intracavitary placement ,  doses of radiation to tumor and normal tissues ,  and other treatment variables ,  were reviewed by a radiation oncologist .
On the basis of the results of two earlier RTOG trials ,  we predicted that the five-year survival rate for the control group (radiotherapy alone) would be 65 percent for patients with stage IB or II disease and 40 percent for patients with stage III or IVA disease .
A total of 403 patients were enrolled in the study between September 1990 and November 1997 ,  201 were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy ,  and 202 were assigned to receive radiotherapy alone .
Fifteen patients (4 percent) — six in the combined-therapy group and nine in the radiotherapy group — were subsequently disqualified because of failure to undergo the required evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (eight patients) ,  the presence of extrapelvic cancer (two) ,  the presence of a rare histologic subtype (one) ,  the presence of a stage IB1 tumor with no involvement of pelvic nodes (one) ,  the absence of pretreatment data (two) ,  and receipt of chemotherapy before radiotherapy (one) .
Major but acceptable treatment deviations occurred in another 1 percent and 9 percent of these groups ,  respectively .
Eleven patients (3 percent) did not undergo brachytherapy ,  three patients refused ,  and eight patients did not undergo it for other reasons .
In all ,  26 patients did not complete treatment .
Of the 195 patients in the combination-therapy group ,  159 (81 percent) completed at least two cycles of chemotherapy ,  and 133 (68 percent) completed three cycles .
Four patients refused or were unable to receive ny chemotherapy but were included in the analysis according to the intention to treat .
Of these ,  147 patients in the combined-therapy group (76 percent) and 122 patients in the radiotherapy group (63 percent) were alive at the time of the last analysis .
In addition ,  13 patients in the combined-therapy group and 32 patients in the radiotherapy group were alive  but had recurrent cervical cancer .
Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that overall survival rates were significantly better among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy than among those treated with radiotherapy alone (73 percent vs. 58 percent ,  P=0.004) (Table 5 and Fig. 1) .
Disease-free survivalat five years was 67 percent in the combined-therapy group and 40 percent in the radiotherapy group ,  according to Kaplan–Meier analysis (P<0.001) (Fig. 2) .
The rates of distant relapse were 14 percent in the combined-therapy group and 33 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) ,  with a relative risk of relapse of 0.39 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.24 to 0.63) in the combined-therapy group .
The rate of locoregional recurrences was 19 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 35 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) ,  with a relative risk of locoregional recurrences of 0.47 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.31 to 0.71) in the combined-therapy group .
There was no significant difference in overall survival between treatment groups among patients who had stage III or IVA disease ,  although  the study was not designed to have a sufficient number of patients in these subgroups to test for a statistically significant difference .
For patients with stage III or IVA disease ,  the five-year disease-free survival rates were 58 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 38 percent in the radiotherapy group (P=0.13) .
Although chemotherapy  increased the hematologic toxicity ,  this effect was reversible and the incidence of late side effects was similar in the two treatment groups .
Although the group reported significant improvements in overall and disease-free survival with the addition of hydroxyurea therapy ,  the study has been criticized for the use of a low dose of radiation and the poor survival rates in both groups and because more than half of the 190 patients who were enrolled could not be evaluated .
Despite these criticisms ,  the resultsof that study and those of trials assessing concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy for other tumors stimulated studies of the effects of radiotherapy and various combinations of fluorouracil ,  cisplatin ,  mitomycin ,  carboplatin ,  and paclitaxel as treatments for locally advanced cervical cancer.The results of these trials have been encouraging ,  but mostclinicians have not found them sufficiently  convincing to justify the inclusion of chemotherapy in the routine treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer .
In our study ,  the benefit of para-aortic radiation may have been less than that observed in an earlier RTOG trial ,  because our trial required more rigorous staging of para-aortic lymph nodes and included patients with more advanced pelvic disease .
