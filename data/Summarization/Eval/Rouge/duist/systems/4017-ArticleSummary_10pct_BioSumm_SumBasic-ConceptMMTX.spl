Phase I dose-escalation studies were done to test combined irinotecan with fluorouracil and calcium folinate weekly or every 2 weeks .
From May ,  1997 ,  to February ,  1998 ,  we enrolled patients who met the following eligibility criteria ,  histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum ,  age 18-75 years ,  WHO performance status of 2 or less and life expectancy of more than 3 months ,  haemoglobin 100 g/L or more ,  absolute neutrophil count 2.0 10/L ,  platelets 150 10/L or more ,  creatinine 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal ,  total bilirubin 1.25 or less times the upper limit of normal ,  aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 3.0 or less times the upper limit of normal (if liver metastases present ,  1.5 or less times for bilirubin and 5.0 or less times for aspartate and alanine aminotransferases) ,  and no previous (other than adjuvant) chemotherapy ,  finished more than 6 months before randomisation .
For the noirinotecan group ,  the regimens were ,  once-weekly ,  fluorouracil 2600 mg/m by 24 h infusion plus calcium folinate 500 mg/m2 (n=43) ,  or every 2 weeks ,  fluorouracil and calcium folinate at the same doses and administration as in the irinotecan-group 2weekly regimen (n=143) .
The secondary endpoints for efficacy were time to progression ,  duration of response ,  time to treatment failure ,  and overall survival .
The questionnaire includes five scales for functioning ,  one scale for global health status ,  and nine symptom scales .
Based on the assumption that time to progression would be 6 months in the no-irinotecan group and 9 months in the irinotecan group ,  we calculated that 286 patients were needed to show a significant difference for this variable .
We analysed the intention-to-treat population and calculated response rates for the intention-to-treat and evaluable populations.  2 tests were used to compare categorical variables between treatment groups .
The first group included countries that had recruited more than 30 patients (UK ,  Spain ,  France ,  Czech Republic ,  Germany ,  and Austria) ,  the second countries that had recruited 10.30 patients (Belgium ,  Israel ,  South Africa ,  Switzerland ,  and Italy) ,  and the third countries that had recruited fewer than ten patients (Greece ,  Portugal ,  and the Netherlands) .
We tested the nine following variables ,  sex ,  WHO performance status (<2 and <=2) ,  weight loss (<=5% and >5%) ,  number of organs involved (<3 and <=3) ,  primary tumour site (colon or rectum) ,  organ involvement (liver only or other sites) ,  time from first diagnosis to first metastasis (0.3 ,  >3-12 ,  >12 months) ,  previous surgery ,  and previous adjuvant therapy .
For time to progression ,  Cox's proportional hazards modelling was used ,  with the following variables ,  sex ,  age (<58 and <=58 years) ,  WHO performance status (<2 and >= 2) ,  weight loss (<=5% and >5%) ,  number of organs involved (<3 and >=3) ,  primary tumour site (colon or rectum) ,  liver involvement ,  lymph-node involvement ,  time from first diagnosis to first metastasis (0-3 ,  >3.12 ,  >12 months) ,  previous surgery ,  previous adjuvant therapy ,  time from first diagnosis and first infusion (<9 and <=9 months) .
We used log-rank tests to compare the two groups .
In the irinotecan group ,  diarrhoea and neutropenia were the most common toxic effects in each regimen ,  and were significantly more frequent and severe than in the noirinotecan group .
This study population was large (385 patients treated) ,  and the patients were representative of candidates for first-line chemotherapy in clinical practice ,  except that an unexpectedly high proportion of them had synchronous metastases at baseline and ,  consequently ,  a relatively low proportion of them had had previous adjuvant chemotherapy .
Another phase III study that compared irinotecan combined with bolus fluorouracil and fluorouracil alone consistently provided significantly higher response rates (33 vs 18% ,  p<0.001) and median time to treatment failure (5.0 vs 3.8 months ,  p<0.05) in the irinotecan group .
Moreover ,  irinotecan combined with fluorouracil and calcium folinate is the only treatment to show a survival advantage in metastatic colorectal cancer over high-dose continuous infusion fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone .
The results we achieved with the irinotecan combination treatment show that the addition of irinotecan to weekly or 2-weekly regimens of fluorouracil and calcium folinate by infusion brings clear clinical benefit and should be considered as a first-line reference treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer as well as for advanced disease .
