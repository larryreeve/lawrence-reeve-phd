Introduction .
Methods .
The cervical diameter was assessed by alginate mould .
The codes were revealed after we had obtained the patient’s informed consent .
A boost of 5–10 Gy was given to the positive nodes .
In all cases ,  a lower midline incision was made ,  which skirted the umbilicus and extended to the cephalad when indicated .
Statistical analysis .
We used 2 test with Yates’ continuity correction to test the association between discrete variables .
We compared quantitative data by one-way analysis of variance .
A significance level of 95% was chosen .
Results .
The trial profile shows the flow of patients in the study (figure 1) .
We excluded these cases from the analysis .
There were no significant between-group differences in the distribution of factors affecting prognosis (table 1) .
Six of the 24 surgery-group patients showed no lymph-node metastasis in the surgical specimen .
Median follow-up was 87 (range 57–120) months .
The status of the patients according to primary therapy and cervical diameter is shown in table 3 .
Results of univariate and multivariate analysis are shown in table 4 .
Of these 86 patients ,  60 (70%) died of disease .
However ,  when cervical diameter was taken into account ,  there were substantial between-group differences in pelvic recurrence .
In particular ,  among radiotherapy-group patients with cervical diameter larger than 4 cm ,  the rate of pelvic relapse was more than twofold the rate of distant relapses (30% vs 13%) .
This accounts for an overall mortality rate of 0·6% .
Discussion .
Radical hysterectomy allows the gonadal function of at least one ovary to be saved ,  thereby avoiding the effects of early menopause in younger women .
Shortening and fibrosis of the vagina can be limited if the woman is sexually active .
The women with a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm had the most unfavourable pathological prognostic factors and were at risk of a relapse independently from any other clinical factor .
These data are confirmed by other previous studies .
The most important clinical risk factors that could indicate benefit of combined treatments are cervical diameter and lymph node status as assessed by lymphangiography .
This finding should resolve some of the conflicting approaches to this issue.14–16 Our results suggest that the optimum candidates for primary radical surgery are women with normal ovarian function and cervical diameters of 4 cm or smaller ,  whereas radiotherapy is preferable for postmenopausal women .
