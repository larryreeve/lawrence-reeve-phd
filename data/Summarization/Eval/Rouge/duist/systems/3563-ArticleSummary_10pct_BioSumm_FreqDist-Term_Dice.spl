Of these ,  the method that has proven successful in most situations and in the hands of most surgeons has been the two-layer anastomosis using interrupted silk sutures for an outer inverted seromuscular layer and a running absorbable suture for a transmural inner layer .
Each stitch was advanced approximately 5 mm. To avoid ischemia of the anastomosis ,  the surgeon had to ensure that only enough pressure was applied to the suture while following to approximate the ends of the bowel and render the anastomosis watertight .
Anastomotic failure was defined as a fistula documented radiographically or by the finding of a nonabsorbable material (charcoal) draining from the wound after oral administration ,  or a visible disruption of the suture line during reexploration .
Of the three patients in whom fistulas developed ,  one patient had abdominal carcinomatosis ,  one had diffuse peritonitis from an iatrogenic injury of the cecum that occurred during a radical resection of a gynecologic malignancy ,  and the third patient had been treated with an abbreviated laparotomy for trauma and was undergoing a planned reoperation .
The two-layer interrupted anastomosis has its origins in the early 19th century through the experimental work of Travers and of Lembert ,  who advocated careful approximation of the serosal surfaces of the bowel and devised a method of suturing to accomplish this .
Numerous studies in the literature comparing techniques (e.g. ,  one-layer vs. two-layer ,  hand-sewn vs. stapled ,  and end-to-end vs. end-to-side) have failed to demonstrate a clear superiority of one over another .
Because at least three packets are required (15 sutures) ,  the cost for the outer layer alone is $28.33 compared with $4.51 for one packet of polypropylene suture .
Even more dramatic is the difference in cost when compared with a stapled anastomosis ,  the disposable staple gun costs $115.26 and two refills cost an additional $123.54 ,  for a total of $238.80! .
Although it is certainly possible to create an ischemic continuous anastomosis by applying too much tension while following the suture ,  Hautefeuille has argued that this is easier to avoid with a continuous suture because there is no point in the anastomosis where the bowel is completely devoid of its blood supply .
Further ,  the surface of monofilament plastic suture is slick and may permit areas of relative excess extension to equilibrate with surrounding areas of less tension by minute movements of tissue with respect to the suture material .
