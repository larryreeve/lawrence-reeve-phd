Over the past several decades ,  the prognosis of patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix has been poor ,  particularly for those with bulky local tumors and extensive parametrial extension .
While no therapy has been proven more effective than radical external-beam plus intracavitary radiotherapy ,  considerable research effort ,  including addition of chemotherapy plus radiation ,  is currently being put into improving survival rate in patients with advanced carcinoma of the cervix .
Thus ,  we designed the randomized trial to compare the tumor response and survival rate of patients with advanced cervical carcinoma receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus patients receiving radiotherapy alone .
Other eligibility criteria consisted of a pathologically verified squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix ,  a Karnofsky performance status index of 80% or above ,  and an age of younger than 70 years .
Pretreatment evaluation included a complete medical history and physical examination ,  complete blood count ,  serum electrolytes ,  chemistry profile ,  tumor markers ,  chest X ray ,  an electrocardiogram ,  and contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis .
External beam irradiation was started on Day 1 and delivered using a linear accelerator of 10-MV photons to the whole pelvis using a four-field box technique .
In the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group ,  chemotherapeutic regimens consisted of cisplatin (50 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously at the rate of 1 mg/min on Day 1) ,  vincristine (1 mg/m2 intravenously push on Day 2) ,  and bleomycin (25 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously infusion in divided doses on Days 2 ,  3 ,  and 4) which were given starting on Day 1 of radiotherapy and then every 3 weeks for a total of four courses .
Survival was defined as the observed length of life from protocol entry to death or until January 5 ,  1997 when the data analysis was finished and patients were still alive .
Detailed data of the presenting patient characteristics with age ,  FIGO stage ,  tumor size ,  histologic grade ,  and parametrium status were listed in Table 1 .
Of the radiotherapy group ,  60 patients completed radiotherapy with no delays of treatment for toxicity ,  whereas the planned radiotherapy was interrupted for 1 week in 2 patients because of radiation protitis or neutropenia .
The acute treatment-related toxicity (grade 3 or 4) appears to be higher with the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group when compared with radiation group (36.7% versus 17.7% ,  P Å 0.02) .
Although there was no significant difference between the two compared groups with regard to treatment-related late toxicity (concurrent group 23.3% versus radiation group 12.9% ,  P = 0.13) , a nonsignificant trend toward a higher rate of late toxicity in the chemoradiotherapy group is evident .
Additionally ,  there was one death related to late toxicity due to a small bowel obstruction with perforation and following with sepsis after chemoradiotherapy .
An analysis of the patterns of failure reveals that the incidence of pelvic failure was equally distributed between the treatment groups (31.7% versus 30.6% ,  P Å 0.93) .
Of the radiation group ,  33 patients (53.2%) are alive without evidence of disease ,  7 (11.3%) remain alive with disease ,  and 22 (35.5%) died of disease at 12 ­ 45 months .
After a median follow-up of 46.8 months ,  the disease-free survival and actuarial survival rates at 3 years for patients in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group were not statistically different compared with patients in the radiotherapy group (51.7% versus 53.2% ,  P Å 0.92 ,  and 61.7% versus 64.5% ,  P Å 0.88 ,  respectively) .
Over the past few years ,  there have been multiple studies published which have retrospectively analyzed the outcome of patients with advanced cervical carcinoma who received concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
The concept of concurrent chemoradiotherapy offers a number of theoretical advantages ,  which produces no delay in the start of definitive radiotherapy ,  no time gap to induce cross-resistance ,  and the possibility of eradication of subclinical metastasis .
Only a randomized trial ,  using a single agent of weekly cisplatin in combination with radiotherapy ,  has shown a significant improvement in local ­ regional control when compared with radiation alone .
Therefore ,  to test the hypothesis of concurrent chemoradiotherapy improving the survival rate of advanced cervical cancer ,  in 1990 we began a phase III randomized trial comparing concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus pelvic radiation alone in patients with advanced cervical carcinoma at our institution .
To further increase the systemic activity and the radiation-enhancing potential of the chemotherapy ,  we chose cisplatin-based regimens with vincristine and bleomycin in this trial because it had proven high efficacy of local control in our previous phase I and II trials for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
Although the response rate of 88.4% ,  following concurrent chemoradiotherapy ,  in our study is very encouraging when compared with 74.3% of the radiotherapy group at the end of therapy ,  this study does not provide evidence that chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone with respect to survival .
The most likely explanation for the poor results in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group is the higher treatmentrelated toxicity ,  and that could limit the dose of definitive radiation employed or interrupt the planned radiotherapy .
On the other hand ,  a probable explanation for the poor survival in advanced cervical cancer patients ,  in spite of a satisfactory rate of initial response ,  may be the enhancement of accelerated tumor proliferation during treatment .
