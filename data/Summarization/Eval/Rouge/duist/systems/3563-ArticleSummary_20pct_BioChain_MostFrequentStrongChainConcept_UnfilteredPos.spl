Intestinal anastomosis has been successfully performed for more than 150 years using a variety of techniques ,  materials ,  and devices .
Of these ,  the method that has proven successful in most situations and in the hands of most surgeons has been the two-layer anastomosis using interrupted silk sutures for an outer inverted seromuscular layer and a running absorbable suture for a transmural inner layer .
Recently ,  several reports have appeared advocating a single-layer continuous anastomosis using monofilament plastic suture .
This anastomosis requires less time to fashion ,  costs less than any other method ,  and may have a lower risk of leakage .
Because of these potential advantages ,  we hypothesized that the single-layer technique could be introduced into our surgical teaching program with no increase in anastomotic failure and that it could be performed in less time than the two-layer technique .
METHODS .
Patients requiring anastomosis to the rectum or third or fourth portion of the duodenum were excluded because the single-layer continuous method is awkward when both ends of the bowel cannot be fully mobilized .
Patients requiring gastrointestinal anastomosis were excluded because of the presumably increased risk of hemorrhage from the stomach .
Patients were also excluded if the surgeon did not believe that either technique could be used because of technical concerns such as edema or scarring .
Patients were assigned to either the one-or two-layer technique in a prospective ,  randomized fashion .
Opaque ,  sealed envelopes indicating the technique to be used were placed in the operating room and were drawn sequentially when the need for intestinal anastomosis became apparent .
The study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board ,  which also granted a waiver of consent because both methods were in common use in our institution and had similar results .
All two-layer anastomoses were constructed using interrupted 3.0 silk Lembert sutures for the outer layer and a running 3.0 polyglycolic acid suture for the transmural inner layer .
Each stitch was advanced approximately 5 mm. To avoid ischemia of the anastomosis ,  the surgeon had to ensure that only enough pressure was applied to the suture while following to approximate the ends of the bowel and render the anastomosis watertight .
The two-layer interrupted anastomosis has its origins in the early 19th century through the experimental work of Travers and of Lembert ,  who advocated careful approximation of the serosal surfaces of the bowel and devised a method of suturing to accomplish this .
In 1836 ,  Dieffenbach performed the fist successful anastomosis of the small intestine using Lemberts method .
In fact ,  the only technique that has been unequivocally demonstrated to be unacceptable is the everted anastomosis .
To accomplish a two-layer anastomosis ,  at least 1 cm of the serosal surface must be circumferentially cleared of mesentery ,  appendices epiploica ,  and omentum before beginning the anastomosis .
The senior authors of this paper (J.M.B. ,  E.E.M.) have used the single-layer technique exclusively for many years and can routinely perform an anastomosis in 8 to 10 minutes .
In contrast ,  it is difficult for an experienced surgeon to create a two-layer anastomosis in less than 20 to 25 minutes .
