These doses of radiation were chosen after trials by the Veterans Administration Surgical Adjuvant Group and the Princess Margaret Hospital ,  Toronto ,  suggested survival advantage with radiotherapy for patients with tumours of Dukes stage C .
Despite the suggestion of a real biological effect of the radiotherapy in the first MRC trial ,  with significant changes in tumour stage ,  no advantage was found for either radiotherapy group over the control group in terms of disease recurrence or survival .
In 1981 ,  the MRC began this trial of a higher dose of preoperative radiotherapy in patients with fixed or partially fixed tumours of the rectum who were thought to be suitable for abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection .
Patients and methods .
Patients then proceeded to immediate surgery or to radiotherapy followed by surgery after a minimum of 4 weeks .
Recruitment into the trial started in November ,  1981 ,  and ended in November ,  1989 ,  when 279 patients had been enrolled; 140 patients were allocated surgery alone and 139 preoperative radiotherapy (figure 1) .
This ongoing trial includes randomisation with respect to preoperative radiotherapy for rectal tumours .
Of the 279 patients ,  217 died .
69 (49%) of 140 patients allocated surgery only had partially fixed tumours and 71 (51%) had fixed tumours .
Of the 139 patients who had radiotherapy and surgery 69 (50%) had fixed tumours and 70 (50%) had fixed tumours .
Of patients who received radiotherapy ,  61 (45%) of 137 reported no significant morbidity .
Of patients allocated radiotherapy ,  73 (55%) were found to have no residual disease ,  compared with 66 (48%) of the patients who had surgery alone .
Of patients allocated surgery alone ,  56 (40%) of 140 were thought to have had curative operations compared with 66 (47%) of 139 patients allocated radiotherapy (p=0.21) .
Three patients allocated surgery alone were considered unfit for surgery .
Nine patients allocated preoperative radiotherapy did not have surgery-seven were not fit ,  one patient refused ,  and one was not referred back after radiotherapy .
Again ,  there was no evidence of an increased number of late complications in the radiotherapy group ,  two patients in each treatment group still had complications of the abdominal wounds 12 months after surgery .
Among those who had abdominoperineal excision ,  four of 49 patients who had surgery alone who were assessable at 12 months had complications of the perineal wound compared with seven of 56 patients allocated radiotherapy .
Complications associated with the colostomy were reported in ten surgery alone patients and eight radiotherapy patients ,  and five patients in each group had anastomosis-related complications after anterior restorative resection .
65 patients allocated surgery alone had a recurrence compared with 50 of those allocated radiotherapy .
67 patients allocated surgery alone had a distant recurrence compared with 49 of those allocated radiotherapy .
Disease recurrence or death within 5 years occurred in 108 patients allocated surgery alone and 96 of those allocated radiotherapy .
Of the 279 patients randomised ,  217 have died; 114 (81%) of 140 patients allocated surgery alone and 103 (74%) of 139 patients allocated radiotherapy ,  median survival times are 24 months and 31 months ,  respectively .
Fewer deaths were reported to have been from colorectal cancer or complications of the disease or its treatment among patients allocated preoperative radiotherapy than among those allocated surgery alone (85 vs 103; hazard ratio 0.71 [0.54-0.97] ,  p=0.02) .
Since the trial was closed ,  surgeons have been entering patients in large numbers into the AXIS trial in which there is randomisation with respect to preoperative radiation for patients with rectal cancer ,  with the Swedish model of short ,  high-dose therapy .
