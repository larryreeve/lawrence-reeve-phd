The use of concurrent chemoradiotherapy has shown promising therapeutic results in a variety of tumors .
Therefore ,  to further test the hypothesis ,  a definitive statement about the optimal management in this situation required a prospective ,  randomized trial .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
From October 1990 to April 1995 ,  patients with advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix were entered on the study and randomly assigned to either radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy .
The trial compared the efficacy and tolerability of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer .
Other eligibility criteria consisted of a pathologically verified squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix ,  a Karnofsky performance status index of 80% or above ,  and an age of younger than 70 years .
Adequate hepatic ,  renal ,  and cardiopulmonary functions were essential .
Extraperitoneal staging laparotomy was performed if aspiration cytology was negative .
Treatment Plan .
External beam irradiation was started on Day 1 and delivered using a linear accelerator of 10-MV photons to the whole pelvis using a four-field box technique .
A dose of 4400 cGy was delivered in 22 equal fractions over 30 to 35 days .
Disease-relapsed interval was defined as the time from entry to local recurrence or distant metastasis .
Statistical Considerations .
RESULTS .
Among them ,  60 patients were randomized to the concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy ,  62 were randomized to the radiotherapy alone .
Among them ,  interrupted radiotherapy with delayed treatment because of treatment-related toxicity was observed in 9 cases .
A review of the reasons for these unscheduled interruptions of therapy revealed that 8 were due to hematological toxicity ,  and 1 was due to elevated GOT and GPT .
Of the radiotherapy group ,  60 patients completed radiotherapy with no delays of treatment for toxicity ,  whereas the planned radiotherapy was interrupted for 1 week in 2 patients because of radiation protitis or neutropenia .
The duration of therapy for the patients was 59 days (range ,  49 ­ 78 days) versus 51 days (range ,  47 ­ 65 days) in the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups ,  respectively .
The incidence of delayed treatment was significantly higher in patients with concurrent chemoradiotherapy than those patients with radiation alone (15.0% versus 3.2% ,  P Å 0.02) .
However ,  there was no difference in completeness between concurrent group and radiotherapy group (96.7% versus 100% ,  P = 0.24) .
Toxicity .
Additionally ,  there was one death related to late toxicity due to a small bowel obstruction with perforation and following with sepsis after chemoradiotherapy .
Additionally ,  there was also no difference in the incidence of distant failure between the chemoradiotherapy group and the radiotherapy group (21.6% versus 29% ,  P Å 0.47) .
DISCUSSION .
Radiation effects are dependent on well-oxygenated tumor cells .
Therefore ,  the design of a more efficient treatment modality ,  such as the addition of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy ,  with the objective of increasing tumor control and long-term survival for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma ,  is advocated .
Computerized tomography lacks sensitivity for identifying micrometastasis outside the pelvic radiation therapy field .
This finding has been associated with occult extrapelvic disease .
There appears to be a small decrease in distant relapse among the concurrent chemoradiation group ,  although the difference was not significant .
The accelerated repopulation in the treatment may involve only a small number of surviving cells ,  which could be omitted by posttreatment investigations .
