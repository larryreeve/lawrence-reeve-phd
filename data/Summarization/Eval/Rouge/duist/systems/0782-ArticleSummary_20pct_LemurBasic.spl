surgical stress anaesthetics and other drugs hypercoagulability blood transfusions and surgery induced impairment of immune function are all reasons why the perioperative period is considered a vulnerable phase in which tumour progression is likely 
patients were randomly assigned no adjuvant treatment control group or an immediate postoperative intraportal infusion of 500mg m fluorouracil plus 5000 units heparin in 1 l 5 glucose per 24 h for 7 consecutive days days 1 7 plus 10 mg m mitomycin in a single dose on day 1 
postoperatively blood counts and liver function tests were done on days 1 3 5 7 10 14 28 and 42 resected tissue was examined by histology and classified dukes classification astler coller modification 
we excluded 28 patients 26 did not have adenocarcinoma lymphoma ovarian cancer urothelial cancer and others and in 2 the protocol was violated radiation therapy to the pelvis was added for rectal cancer 
hazard ratios were derived from a proportional hazards regression model with stratification for localisation of the tumour colon vs rectum and with covariates for nodal status positive vs negative and age four groups defined by the 25th 50th and 75th percentiles of the age distribution of the evaluable patients namely 57 63 and 69 years 
in 41 patients 17 4 treatment was assigned but not given because of surgery related problems 7 difficulties with catheter placement 7 other technical problems 14 patient refusal 2 and various other reasons 11 
at median follow up of 96 months 235 patients had died 108 in the infusion group and 127 in the control group 5 year overall survival was also higher in the infusion group table 2 
the 30 day postoperative mortality rate was 1 9 10 533 patients 2 3 6 266 in the control group and 1 5 4 267 in the infusion group 1 patient in each group died of myocardial infarction 2 patients in the control group died of refractory small bowel obstruction and 3 patients in each group died of antibiotic resistant gram negative septicaemia 
transient leucopenia 3 x10 white blood cells per l developed in 6 patients during adjuvant chemotherapy and the white blood cell count was significantly lower on postoperative days 7 and 10 in the infusion group than in the control group 
there were only 2 cases of thrombocytopenia 56 and 71 x 10 l in the infusion group but the mean platelet count was significantly lower on day 28 than that in the control group 
this trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase survival in patients with colorectal cancer 
after median follow up of 8 years we were notable to confirm the overall reduction of liver metastases reported by taylor et al we did find however a consistent reduction of all kinds of tumour recurrences that resulted in a significant advantage in overall survival and disease free survival for patients treated with adjuvant portal infusion confirming previous findings 
previous investigations with the exception of one have shown improvements in overall and disease free survival and a reduction in the frequency of liver recurrences especially in the subgroups of colon cancer patients and of those with tumour involved regional lymph nodes dukes c 
two as yet unpublished meta analyses of all randomised trials comparing portal adjuvant chemotherapy with a no treatment control group have been conducted by the european organization on research and treatment of cancer and the oxford colorectal cancer cooperative group 
however none of the studies couldc onfirm the statistically significant overall effect on the frequency of liver metastases reported by taylor et al it seems likely that the effect of adjuvant portal chemotherapy on overall and disease free survival can be attributed to the systemic effects of intraportal fluorouracil which lead to a reduction in all tumour relapses ie local recurrences liver metastases and other distant metastases 
deaths attributable to portal adjuvant chemotherapy have been reported in at least three trials 1 in taylor et al s study due to perirectal sepsis 1 in fielding and colleagues study a patient more than 80 years old and 1 in our trial an insulin dependent diabetic man who had gram negative septicaemia and leucopenia during portal infusion 
for further studies we recommend that patients with insulin dependent diabetes a high risk of postoperative complications obesity cardiac and or pulmonary disease or any evidence of intra abdominal sepsis at laparotomy or during the early postoperative period should be excluded from participation 
this low incidence of surgical complications suggests advances in surgical technique and in patient management before and after elective cancer surgery that allow safe use of adjuvant chemotherapy soon after surgical intervention 
based on previous results and our own findings the swiss group for clinical cancer research decided to accept perioperative adjuvant chemotherapy as the standard treatment for further clinical trials in colorectal cancer
