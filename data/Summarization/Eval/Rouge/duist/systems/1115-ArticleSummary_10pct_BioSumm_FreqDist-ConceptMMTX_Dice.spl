These include modifications of radiation treatment volume or fractionation including extended field radiation ,  hyperfractionated RT ,  strategies to overcome the negative impact of tumor hypoxia such as hyperbaric oxygen ,  or hypoxic cell radiation sensitizers .
These advantages include no delay in the start of definitive irradiation ,  no prolongation of overall treatment time (thus minimizing the theoretical risk of accelerated clonogen proliferation during the antineoplastic course) ,  and possible interaction of the concurrently administered chemotherapy with radiation through such mechanisms as inhibition of repair of radiation damage ,  cell synchronization ,  recruitment of nonproliferating cells into cell cycle ,  and reduction of the hypoxic fraction .
Theoretical disadvantages of concurrent administration include increased acute toxicity which might limit or delay the delivery of definitive irradiation or increased late toxicity particularly if the drugs and radiation do not exhibit ‘‘toxicity’’ independence .
While these studies suggested some benefit for patients with FIGO stage IIIB cancer ,  methodological problems in the study have not resulted in wide acceptance of the conclusion of benefit from concurrent hydroxyurea and its concurrent use has not entered standard practice .
The optimal dosing schedule for maximizing cell kill with infusional 5-FU and radiation remains undefined ,  but laboratory data suggested greater effects with increasing dose and prolonged exposure to 5-FU and when drug was present for intervals in excess of 48 h after radiation .
Eligible patients were to have biopsy proven invasive carcinoma of the cervix of any pathological type excluding small cell carcinoma and to have primary radiotherapy with curative intent selected as their definitive treatment .
Patients were randomized to receive either (a) standard external beam pelvic irradiation (EBRT) in a dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions defined at 100% versus ,  (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional intravenous 5-FU in a dose of 1 g/m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  (c) partially hyperfractionated RT ,  5280 cGy in 33 fractions ,  2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  or (d) arm (c) with the same infusional 5-FU .
Figure 1 demonstrates the study design ,  the four-arm study was designed to determine whether any significant differences in outcome were evident between arms (a) and (d) and to be explanatory with respect to causation .
Assuming that the magnitude and direction of the 5-FU effects were similar in arms (b) and (d) then the effect of the addition of 5-FU could be tested by comparing arms (b) and (d) with arms (a) and (c) .
The reduced fraction size in arms (c) and (d) was designed to attempt to take advantage of knowledge of the affect of fraction size on late complications and to determine whether complication rates were decreased by using decreased fraction size .
The effect of the fractionation was to be tested by comparing arms (c) and (d) with arms (a) and (b) (Fig. 1) .
In order to detect an improvement of 15% in survival in arms (c) and (d) compared to that seen in arms (a) and (b) ,  assuming a 40% cause-specific survival rate in arm (a) and an alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.2 ,  the total number of patients required was 272 .
Severe late or chronic bowel symptoms were those of fistula ,  perforation ,  stricture ,  or obstruction requiring hospitalization or surgery and bleeding requiring transfusion .
Cytopenias were classed as grade 3 if bleeding or infection/fever occurred due to low blood counts and grade 2 if neutrophils were less than 1000 units/L or platelets less than 50,000 units/L .
For strata 1 and 2 the distribution of FIGO stage ,  tumor size ,  nodal involvement on lymphography ,  tumor grade ,  and capillary lymphatic space involvement (CLS) for each treatment are shown in Tables 1 and 2 .
In the standard radiation plus 5-FU arm (b) ,  52 of the 53 patients received the standard dose prescription .
Of the 23 patients who received no intracavitary radiation or doses less than 500 cGy ,  there was a relatively even distribution across the treatment arms with 5 in arm (a) ,  5 in arm (b) ,  3 in arm (c) ,  and 9 in arm (d) .
The disease free 5-year survival in arm (a) ,  (c) ,  (d) ,  and (b) ,  respectively , were 45 ,  53 ,  58 ,  and 61% .
The overall pelvic control by treatment assigned for arms (a) ,  (c) ,  (d) ,  and (b) was 58 ,  65 ,  68 ,  and 69% ,  respectively .
To reach the conclusion that concurrent chemotherapy truly adds benefit to results achievable with radiation alone ,  it is important that the radiation be delivered in an optimal manner with adequate doses at ‘‘Point A’’ (80 to 90 Gy) and limited overall treatment times .
The tumor- and patient-related factors examined were FIGO stage (IB versus IIA versus IIB) ,  size of tumor (greater or less than 6 cm and greater or less than 7 cm) ,  grade of tumor the presence or absence of capillary-like space involvement ,  nodal involvement ,  and patient age as a continuous variable .
