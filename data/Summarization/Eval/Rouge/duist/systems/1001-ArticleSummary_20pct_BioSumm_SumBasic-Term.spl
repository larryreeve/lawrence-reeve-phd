Patients and Methods ,  A total of 189 patients with resected Dukes' C colorectal cancer were randomly allocated to infusions of a total of 900 mg 17-1A antibody ,  500 mg postoperatively followed by 4 monthly doses of 100 mg (n = 99) ,  or to observation only (n = 90) .
Wondering what the characteristic features of these trials were ,  one notes that two of these trials ,  one in lymphoma and one in breast carcinoma ,  2 had been performed with engineered antibodies ,  ie ,  either human/ murine chimeric or human complementanly defining regious (CDR)-grafted mmunoglobulins respectively ,  while the third stands out because of the target and end point used .
In contrast to other trials aimed at patients with larger metastatic tumor masses and using regression or shrinkage as the end point ,  this one on colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C required microscopically complete resection of the primary tumor for patients to be admitted.3 As the primary end point ,  overall-survival was determined at 5 years .
Here ,  we report on the 7-year follow-up study of this prospective randomized two-arm trial in minimal residual disease that used the murine 17-1A antibody ,  4 which recognizes a 34-kd glycoprotein of the cell membrane of epithelial cells.5 The 5-year analysis had shown that a short ,  albeit intensive ,  postoperative course of antibody treatment (900 mg total dose) significantly reduced the appearance of distant metastases ,  but did not affect the rate of local relapses .
Now ,  after a median observation time of 7 years ,  with only four of 185 patients monitored for less than 5 years ,  the study has matured and continues to demonstrate a significant benefit with regard to survival .
The multicenter study consisted of six academic centers in former West Germany A total of 189 patients were randomized ,  with the first patient entered in May 1985 and the last in Apnl 1990 The study was closed in December 1992 ,  and we present here the final status with median follow-up data of 7 years Eligible patients were required to have histologically confirmed adenocarcmoma of colon or the rectum with spread to regional lymph nodes (Dukes' C or International Unimon Agamst Cancer [UICC] stage III) In addition ,  hlstopathologic confirmation of curative resection (R0) was secured Radical tumor resection was performed by a standardized technique agreed upon by all participating centers When located within 15 cm of the anal verge ,  a tumor was classified as rectal carcinoma Patients were less than 70 years old and had a Karnofsky index greater than 50% Eleven of 99 patients randomized to treatment refused their treatment assignment ,  but were otherwise considered eligible for the study .
All patients were stratified according to Zelen 8 by the following factors participating center ,  sex ,  location of tumor ,  stage (Dukes' Cl or C2 equivalent to pN1 or pN2-3) ,  number of affected lymph nodes ,  and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level before surgery (Table 1) In the treated arm ,  more patients had pT2 and pT3 tumors ,  and fewer had pT4 tumors However ,  treated patients appeared to have had higher numbers of involved lymph nodes (pN2) and tumors of less differentiated histology (grade 3) .
However ,  a Fishers' exact test ,  companng the distnbutlon of patients according to all prognostic variables ,  showed no significant differences Randomlzation before consent was performed and evaluated according to Zelen 9 On approval by legal experts in 1985 ,  this procedure was accepted by the ethical review board Statistical analyses were performed according to SAS (Statistical Analysis System ,  Cary ,  NC) To test for potential selection bias in the study ,  a retrospective analysis was performed at Medizimnische Hochschule Hannover on 67 Dukes' C colorectal cancer patients selected from 107 patients seen between 1980 and 1985 They fulfilled the entry criteria for the 17-1A clinical trial and were monitored for at least 5 years each The survival analysis was performed by the Instutut fur Medlzinische Informatlk und Blomathematlk ,  Umversltat Essen The overall survival according to Kaplan-Meier curve is nearly identical to the control group of the 17-1A trial (log-rank ,  P = 97) ,  thus ,  this historical control does not show any selection bias .
Patients in both groups were monitored in exactly the same way ,  with 14 prospectively defined follow-up visits ,  first on a quarterly and later on a half-year basis Follow-up evaluation continued beyond 5 years at yearly time points ,  but without formal protocol requirements .
For the end point analysis ,  standardized and objectively verifiable dates were used for all patients ,  e ,  time point of surgery up to death of all cause or date of last contact alive for overall survival analysis In a separate analysis ,  cancer-related mortality was assessed ,  e ,  death without recurrence was not counted as an event .
A documented histologic or radiologic diagnosis of disease was  required to confirm local or distant recurrence ,  whereas abnormal CEA values were not used as evidence of relapse .
The 17-1A antibody ,  a munne monoclonal mmunoglobulin IgG2a antibody ,  orginally described by Herlyn has a distinct antitumor effect on human xenografted tumors in a nude mouse model Clnical-grade antibody was purchased from the Wistar Institute (Philadelphia ,  PA) ,  with support by the German Cancer Aid (Bonn ,  Germany) .
The KaplanMeier survival curves (Fig 1A) showed a significant benefit for patients who received antibody over those who did not receive treatment (P < .01 with Cox's proportional hazard model corrected for influence of prognostic variables ,  and P = .01 with log-rank test for the univariate analysis) .
When cancer-related mortality was assessed ,  ie ,  death without recurrence was not counted as event ,  the benefit of treatment remained significant at P < .01 by Cox's multivariate analysis and P = .01 by log-rank test for the univariate analysis .
According to the disease-free interval analysis ,  tumor recurred in 96 of 166 eligible patients after 7 years of follow-up evaluation ,  thus ,  three more recurrences were recorded m the treatment group and one more in the observation arm .
The calculated recurrence rate was 68% (49 of 76 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  53 to 82) m the control group and 52% (47 of 90 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  39 to 67) in the 17-1A group .
The reduction in recurrence was 23% (hazards ratio ,  0.66 ,  95% confidence interval ,  1% to 43%) Recurrence-free intervals were plotted according to Kaplan-Maier (Fig 2) .
When the analyses of recurrence-free interval and recurrence-free survival were performed including all randomized patients ,  ie ,  according to intention-to-treat ,  17-1A treatment again led to significant advantage over the untreated group (Cox multivanate ,  P = .02 ,  log-rank ,  P = .01 ,  respectively) .
As will be reported elsewhere ,  the serum levels of antiidlotyplc antibodies (Ab2) showed no significant differences between the analyzed patients who remained tumor free (n = 30) or experienced a relapse (n = 30) .
Also ,  the less significant umvariate analyses may well be explained by the large treatment effect ,  which we expected at the onset of the trial in 1985 ,  when we hoped for an absolute reduction of events from 50% to 30% ,  ie ,  a 40% relative reduction .
The observed reduction of approximately 30% is clearly lower than expected ,  but still in the order of that obtained by Moertel et al and Krook et al after a similar follow-up period .
Since these forms of therapy were administered only to the control group ,  a bias may have been introduced that influenced the outcome against the antibody treatment ,  which explains the apparent difference seen m the local recurrence rate (Table 2) .
For example ,  the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) conducted a study from 1977 to 1983 to compare a combination regimen that consisted of semustmine ,  folic acid ,  and fluorouracil with bacillus Calmette-Guerin .
This strategy ,  originally pro1 7 posed by Sears et al ,  was only partially successful ,  as only about 20% of the recipients did not respond to mouse immunoglobulin ,  while the others exhibited a distinct ,  albeit slow rise of HAMA titers .
However ,  patients with and without manifest metastatic relapses did not differ in antiidiotype titers. 18 To detect ab3 antibodies ,  we applied a sensitive enzyme-linked mmunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) ,  which allowed us to determine human 17-1A autoantibody .
By double staining of individual metastatic cells in bone marrow ,  It was shown that the 17-lA target is expressed by disseminated cells in only two thirds of the examined patients .
Therefore ,  in anticipation of antigenic heterogeneity ,  a combination therapy that consists of antibodies of different specificities may forestall a selection of antigen-negative cells exerted inevitably by a one-antibody approach .
This view is supported by the immediate gastrointestinal toxicity ,  such as abdominal cramps ,  nausea ,  and transient diarrhea ,  observed in a substantial proportion of patients shortly after infusion of the antibody .
The discovery of the adhesion function of the 17-1A molecule , hence the new name EpCAM ,  raised the speculation that the antibody inhibited outgrowth of metastasis by interference with cell-cell adhesion .
In other studies that also targeted a monoclonal antibody to an organ-specific ,  rather than a tumor-specific antigen ,  the tumor-specific biologic action induced by the applied antibody had been ascribed to the faster elimination of the bound antibody from normal than from malignant cells .
In conclusion ,  the presented results still support the original hypothesis that minimal residual disease occurring so frequently in patients with sohd tumors appears to be an indication for antibody therapy .
