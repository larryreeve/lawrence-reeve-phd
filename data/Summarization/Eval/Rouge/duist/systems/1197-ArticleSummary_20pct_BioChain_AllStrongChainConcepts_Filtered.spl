Patients between 18 and 65 years of age with grade 3 to 4 spindle-cell sarcomas (primary diameter >= 5 cm or any size recurrent tumor) in extremities or girdles were eligible .
The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 48 months in the treatment group and 16 months in the control group (P = .04) ,  and the median overall survival (OS) was 75 months for treated and 46 months for untreated patients (P = .03) .
The treatment of limb sarcomas mainly relies on a combined-modality approach ,  after the demonstration that pre-or postoperative radiation and conservative surgery led to local control in a high proportion of patients.4 In fact ,  limb-sparing procedures allow an 85% to 90% local dis-ease-free survival (DFS) rate and demolitive surgery now represents only 5% to 10% of the operations in comparison with the 50% survival rate of the 1960s to 1970s .
The main findings were statistical evidence in favor of chemotherapy for local ,  metastasis ,  and overall DFS (P = .016 ,  .0003 ,  and .0001 ,  respectively) and a trend towards increased OS (P = .12) .
Not one new study has been already reported ,  whereas the present Italian co-operative study closed patient accrual in November 1996 because of the results of the planned interim analysis .
After a positive biopsy for sarcoma ,  all patients underwent complete staging and programmed local treatment .
The patients who satisfied all the selection criteria were then stratified and subsequently randomized to a control or chemotherapy group .
Inclusion criteria were as follows ,  age ,  18 to 65 years ,  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2 ,  primary tumors subfascially localized with diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm ,  high-grade spindle-cell or polymorphous sarcomas (fibrosarcoma ,  malignant fibrous histiocytoma ,  polymorphous liposarcoma ,  leiomyosarcoma ,  synovial sarcoma ,  malignant schwannoma ,  angiosarcoma ,  and polymorphous rhabdomyosarcoma) ,  local relapse of any size ,  no previous radio/chemotherapy ,  adequate bone marrow (WBC count of >= 4,000/fiL ,  platelets = 120.000/mL ,  and hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL) ,  renal (creatinine <= 1.3 mg/dL) ,  hepatic (SGOT <= 2.5 X normal value and bilirubin <= 1.2 mg/dL) ,  and pulmonary functions .
Exclusion criteria were as follows ,  distant or regional lymph-node metastases ,  previous malignancy ,  medical or psychiatric illness precluding correct written informed consent ,  pregnancy ,  uncontrolled infections ,  and risk of being lost to follow-up .
Patients were treated with radical surgery ,  wide resection followed by postoperative radiation therapy ,  or pre-operative radiation therapy .
Radical surgery consisted of amputation in case of massive involvement of critical structures or compartmental resection in highly selected patients .
Wide resection followed by postoperative radiation therapy (64 to 66 Gy in 32 to 33 fractions ,  5 fractions per week) was used for patients amenable to conservative surgery with negative margins .
Preoperative radiation therapy (44.8 Gy in 28 fractions in 2.5 weeks ,  160 cGy/ fraction ,  2 fractions per day) followed by resection with or without a post-or intraoperative boost (16 to 18 Gy for positive or close surgical margins) was used for tumors extending to critical structures for which conservative surgical resection was expected to be inadequate and amputation would usually have to be performed to obtain negative margins .
Chemotherapy ,  repeated every 3 weeks ,  consisted of five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin (EPI) 60 mg/m2/die ,  in a short intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1 and 2 (total dose per cycle ,  120 mg/m2) ,  IFO 1.8 g/m2/die diluted in 500 mL of normal saline and administered over 1 hour on days 1 through 5 (total dose per cycle ,  9 g/m2) ,  and 6-mercapto-ethansulfonate in a bolus IV injection at 20% of the IFO dose ,  given before and 4 and 8 hours after the IFO infusions .
A dose reduction scheme was defined to avoid excessive toxicity .
In the case of incomplete hematologic recovery (defined as WBC < 4,000/mL and platelets [PLTS] < 100.000/mL) ,  treatment was postponed by one or more weeks ,  furthermore ,  on complete hematologic recovery ,  a dose reduction of EPI was applied depending on the observed nadirs (WBC > 1,000/mL and PLTS > 75.000/mL ,  IFO and EPI doses both 100% ,  WBC > 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL ,  IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 75% ,  WBC < 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL ,  IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 50%) .
All centers faxed protocol-specific eligibility checklists to the statistics office in Aviano ,  patients were stratified using a four-block stratification by primary tumor (diameter < 10 cm v >= 10 cm) and recurrent tumor (diameter < 10 cm v >= 10 cm) and randomized to treatment or control groups .
Radical surgery was performed in 36 patients (35%) ,  27 of whom underwent amputation because of massive local extension and/or distal presentation ,  the other nine had conservative radical surgery .
The remaining 68 patients (65%) were treated using a limb-sparing procedure involving radiation therapy and surgery ,  45 underwent surgery and postoperative radiation therapy ,  and 24 underwent preoperative radiation therapy and conservative surgery (Table 1) .
Chemotherapy and Toxicity .
Seven patients (13%) did not start adjuvant treatment .
Of the 46 patients that started chemotherapy ,  four did not complete the treatment .
One patient refused the fifth and last cycle for personal reasons ,  and three patients did not complete the treatment because of related toxicities (reappearance of viral uveitis ,  consecutive episodes of pneumonitis ,  and persistent leukopenia) after two ,  three ,  and four cycles ,  respectively .
The mean administered doses of the fifth cycle (94 mg of EPI and 8,156 mg of IFO) were slightly lower than those of the fourth cycle (95.5 mg of EPI and 8,257 mg of IFO) .
The average median relative dose-intensity (DI) of the program was 83.3% (Table 2) ,  63% of the cycles were given at a DI of >= 80% and 48% at a DI of >= 90% .
From the third cycle ,  grade 4 leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were less frequent because of the applied dose reductions ,  and anemia became the most important hematologic side effect ,  requiring repeated packed red cell transfusions in 24% of the patients .
Univariate analyses did not reveal any statistically significant difference in overall DFS and OS for any of the characteristics considered (age ,  sex ,  center of surgery ,  histology ,  grading ,  site of primary tumor ,  presentation ,  diameter ,  local treatment ,  and stratification) with the exception of adjuvant treatment (data not shown) .
Because none of the patient characteristics was associated with the end point at the time of univariate analysis ,  unadjusted hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed by means of the Cox proportional hazards model .
In four patients ,  the first event was a synchronous local relapse with metastases (one patient in the control arm and three patients in the treatment arm) .
The cumulative incidence function estimates at 2 years were 0% and 10% for the treatment and the control arms ,  respectively (P = .02) ,  and at 4 years ,  they were 6% and 17% ,  respectively (P = .09) (Table 5) .
Four patients had local relapses simultaneously with metastasis (one patient in the control arm and three in the treatment arm) ,  and another three patients developed a local relapse as the second relapse after a distant metastasis (two patients in the treatment arm and one patient in the control arm) .
Taking into account the overall local relapse rate (all local events observed) ,  11 patients in the control group and nine in the treatment group experienced local failure .
The distribution between the different local treatment modalities (radical surgery ,  surgery and postoperative radiation therapy ,  and preoperative radiation therapy and surgery) was respectively ,  two of 16 patients ,  seven of 20 ,  and two of 15 for the control group and three of 20 patients ,  six of 24 ,  and zero of nine for the treatment group .
The absolute improvement deriving from chemotherapy was 13% at 2 years (85% and 72% in the treatment and control arms ,  respectively ,  P = .10) ,  and the improvement increased to 19% at 4 years (69% and 50% ,  P = .04) (Table 5) .
The preliminary data of previous studies were sometimes positive for DFS and OS , 15-19 but further analyses ,  made after an adequate follow-up time ,  indicated a disappearance of the positive effect of chemotherapy on 20,21 and ,  in some cases ,  worse results.22 However ,  the recently published meta-analysis , 7 involving 1,568 patients ,  showed a statistically significant benefit for treated patients of 6% ,  10% ,  and 10% for local ,  metastatic ,  and overall DFS ,  respectively ,  and a favorable (but not statistically significant) trend in OS (4%) ,  after a median of 9.4 years of follow-up .
In fact ,  disease stages ,  tumor sizes ,  and grading varied greatly.23 Second ,  eight studies made use of a polychemotherapy including an anthracycline ,  vincristine ,  cyclophosphamide ,  and dacarbazine ,  but only the first is active in soft tissue sarcomas ,  the others probably increased toxicity .
This maximum-tolerated dose gave 13 responses of 13 assessable patients ,  but induced relevant toxicities.31 Therefore ,  in the present study ,  the age of the patients was limited to 65 years ,  the number of cycles was limited to five ,  and a predefined dose reduction scheme was established to reduce the dose of anthracycline depending on the level of leukopenia reached during the previous cycle .
The benefit is seen despite the fact that four of the seven patients that never started chemotherapy for different reasons died from uncontrolled metastatic disease .
Adjuvant treatment of soft tissue sarcomas is still strongly debated35,36 ,  despite 14 published trials and one meta-analysis performed on 1,568 randomized patients .
