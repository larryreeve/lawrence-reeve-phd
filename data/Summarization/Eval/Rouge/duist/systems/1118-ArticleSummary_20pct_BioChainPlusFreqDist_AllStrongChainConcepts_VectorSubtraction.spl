The treatment of choice for advanced cervical carcinoma has traditionally been radiotherapy alone .
The use of concurrent chemoradiotherapy has shown promising therapeutic results in a variety of tumors .
We also compared the toxicity of the two compared groups after planned treatment .
From October 1990 to April 1995 ,  patients with advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix were entered on the study and randomly assigned to either radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy .
The trial compared the efficacy and tolerability of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer .
Treatment Plan .
Eligible patients were randomized to receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy or radiation therapy alone .
A dose of 4400 cGy was delivered in 22 equal fractions over 30 to 35 days .
If this delay exceeded 3 weeks ,  the patient was withdrawn from the study .
Toxicity of chemotherapy was assessed before each course .
Statistical Considerations .
RESULTS .
Among them ,  60 patients were randomized to the concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy ,  62 were randomized to the radiotherapy alone .
Among them ,  interrupted radiotherapy with delayed treatment because of treatment-related toxicity was observed in 9 cases .
A review of the reasons for these unscheduled interruptions of therapy revealed that 8 were due to hematological toxicity ,  and 1 was due to elevated GOT and GPT .
Of the radiotherapy group ,  60 patients completed radiotherapy with no delays of treatment for toxicity ,  whereas the planned radiotherapy was interrupted for 1 week in 2 patients because of radiation protitis or neutropenia .
The incidence of delayed treatment was significantly higher in patients with concurrent chemoradiotherapy than those patients with radiation alone (15.0% versus 3.2% ,  P Å 0.02) .
However ,  there was no difference in completeness between concurrent group and radiotherapy group (96.7% versus 100% ,  P = 0.24) .
Toxicity .
The acute treatment-related toxicity (grade 3 or 4) appears to be higher with the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group when compared with radiation group (36.7% versus 17.7% ,  P Å 0.02) .
Additionally ,  there was one death related to late toxicity due to a small bowel obstruction with perforation and following with sepsis after chemoradiotherapy .
Additionally ,  there was also no difference in the incidence of distant failure between the chemoradiotherapy group and the radiotherapy group (21.6% versus 29% ,  P Å 0.47) .
Survival and Disease-Free .
DISCUSSION .
Therefore ,  the design of a more efficient treatment modality ,  such as the addition of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy ,  with the objective of increasing tumor control and long-term survival for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma ,  is advocated .
Therefore ,  to test the hypothesis of concurrent chemoradiotherapy improving the survival rate of advanced cervical cancer ,  in 1990 we began a phase III randomized trial comparing concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus pelvic radiation alone in patients with advanced cervical carcinoma at our institution .
Our study also revealed that the patterns of recurrences were not changed by the concomitant therapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
This finding has been associated with occult extrapelvic disease .
Indeed ,  in our trial ,  the treatment-related toxicity was severe and resulted in delayed radiotherapy in 15% of patients after chemoradiotherapy ,  in which 77.8% of patients with treatment delays recurred or died of disease .
In our trial ,  grade 3 or 4 treatment-related toxicities were observed more often on chemoradiotherapy than radiotherapy alone .
Moreover ,  two patients died of septicemia following chemoradiotherapy .
