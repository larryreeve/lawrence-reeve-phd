Introduction .
Stage Ib and IIa carcinoma of the cervix can be cured by radical surgery or radiotherapy with similar effectiveness ,  but the rate and types of complications differ .
Radiotherapy is feasible and effective in almost all patients ,  5-year survival after this therapy ranges from 78% to 91% .
By contrast ,  radical surgery affords the opportunity to study pathological findings ,  so that groups of at-risk patients who could benefit from adjuvant treatment can be identified .
The 5-year cure rate after surgery for early-stage cervical tumours ranges from 54% to 90% ,  in most cases this rate is achieved with adjuvant therapy .
The treatment of choice will depend on the policy of the institution ,  the gynaecologist or radiation oncologist involved ,  and the age and the general health of the patient .
Apart from Newton’s study about stage-I diseases ,  there have been no randomised studies to compare radiotherapy with radical surgery in one institution over a short period of time .
We conducted a prospective ,  randomised study to compare external and internal radiotherapy with radical hysterectomy and node dissection .
Our main aim was to evaluate 5-year survival and the rate and pattern of complications and recurrences associated with each procedure .
Methods .
Between September ,  1986 ,  and December ,  1991 ,  578 patients with primary invasive cervical cancer were referred to the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Radiation Oncology ,  at the Istituto di Scienze Biomediche S Gerardo ,  University of Milan ,  Monza .
All patients received standard pretreatment evaluation ,  which included complete blood analysis ,  intravenous pyelogram ,  lymphangiography ,  cystoscopy ,  chest radiography ,  and other tests when indicated .
The cervical diameter was assessed by alginate mould .
We used the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) clinical staging system to classify the stage of cancer.7 If there was disagreement about the stage ,  the case was assigned to the earlier stage. 468 patients had FIGO stage Ib or IIa disease. 343 of these patients were enrolled after they had given their informed consent to take part .
Eligibility criteria were ,  age 30–70 years ,  newly diagnosed stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  no concurrent or previous malignant disease ,  WHO performance status of 1 or less ,  and feasibility of both radical surgery and radiotherapy .
The clinical evaluation of the patients was done by the gynaecological surgeon together with the radiation oncologist to avoid bias in the randomisation ,  in fact ,  patients with unfavourable clinical characteristics are usually treated by radiotherapy alone .
The patients were randomly assigned radical surgery (n=172) or radical radiotherapy (n=171) .
Patients were also stratified by cervical diameter (4 cm or >4 cm) .
Treatment was assigned by block randomisation (clusters of ten cases of each stratum of cervical diameter) from a computer-generated table that had been created before the start of the study .
The treatments in thetable were coded so that no-one could discover treatment allocation before randomisation .
The codes were revealed after we had obtained the patient’s informed consent .
Radiotherapy included ,  external pelvic irradiation with 18 MV photon beam by the multiportal technique ,  one dose of 1·8–2·0Gy at the isocentre ,  and two or more portals treated daily .
The median total dose of radiation was 47 (range 40–53) Gy during 3–5 weeks ,  depending on the tumour volume and nodal status .
After 2 weeks ,  one caesium-137 LDR insertion was carried out .
A complete computerised plane was made ,  according to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements report no 38.8 The total dose at point A (external beam plus brachyradiotherapy) ranged from 70 Gy to 90 Gy (median 76 Gy) .
The total dose to the pelvic wall exceeded 50 Gy ,  an additional dose was administered to the parametria by external beam if necessary .
When lymphangiography showed common iliac or paraortic metastases ,  paraortic lymph nodes were treated with a dose of 45 Gy over 5 weeks and two shaped opposed fields (AP-PA) .
A boost of 5–10 Gy was given to the positive nodes .
Radical surgery consisted of a class III radical abdominal hysterectomy ,  as described by Piver and co-workers .
