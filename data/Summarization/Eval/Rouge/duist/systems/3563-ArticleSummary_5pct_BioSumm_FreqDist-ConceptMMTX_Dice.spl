Of these ,  the method that has proven successful in most situations and in the hands of most surgeons has been the two-layer anastomosis using interrupted silk sutures for an outer inverted seromuscular layer and a running absorbable suture for a transmural inner layer .
All single-layer anastomoses were constructed using a continuous 3.0 polypropylene double-needle suture that began at the mesenteric border (Fig. 1) .
The senior authors of this paper (J.M.B. ,  E.E.M.) have used the single-layer technique exclusively for many years and can routinely perform an anastomosis in 8 to 10 minutes .
Although it did not quite reach statistical significance ,  it may be related to an intrinsic difference between the two methods ,  the single-layer anastomosis always has a larger lumen .
Bailey et al have speculated that the continuous single-layer suture ,  which resembles a circular coiled spring ,  may be able to expand and contract depending on intraluminal forces .
