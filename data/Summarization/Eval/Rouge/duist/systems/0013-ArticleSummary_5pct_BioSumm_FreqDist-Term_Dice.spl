Cisplatin is said to be the most active anticancer drug in cervical cancer ,  although 100 mg/m did not significantly improve the complete response (CR) rate compared prospectively with 50 mg/m (12.7 v 10% ,  respectively) and there was no appreciable difference in response duration ,  progression-free interval (PFI) ,  or survival.Thus ,  there is no convincing reason to use a cisplatindose higher than 50 mg/m .
A phase II study of the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) demonstrated activity formitolactol as a single agent in cervical cancer using 180mg/m/d for 10 days by mouth in repeated 4-week cycles.There were 55 assessable patients ,  with one CR and 15 partial responses (PRs) (29% response rate) .
Ineligible patients included those with cervical neoplasms other than squamous cell carcinoma or with nonmeasurable cervical cancer ,  WBC count less than 4,000/uL and/or platelet count less than 100,000/uL ,  abnormal liver function (bilirubin ,  AST ,  or alkaline phosphatase level > two times normal not related to the cancer) , bilateral hydronephrosis ,  GOG PS 3 or 4 ,  past or concomitant malignancy other than skin (excluding melanoma) ,  prior therapy with cytotoxic drugs except when used as a radiation sensitizer ,  radiationtherapy within 3 weeks of entry ,  lesions measurable only by ultrasound ,  or pregnancy or lactation .
Patients were prospectively stratified according to whether they had received prior radiation-sensitizer treatment (hydroxyurea ,  cisplatin , or fluorouracil) and by PS ,  and were then centrally randomized with equal probability to receive (1) cisplatin 50 mg/m with appropriate hydration every 3 weeks for a maximum of six courses ,  or (2) cisplatin 50 mg/m on day 1 plus mitolactol (180 mg/m orally for 5 days) on days 2 through 6 every 3 weeks ,  or (3) cisplatin 50mg/m plus ifosfamide 5.0 g/m over 24 hours plus mesna 6 g/m given concurrently with ifosfamide and for 12 hours after ,  every 3 weeks ,  again for a maximum of six courses .
Between June 1990 and January 1994 ,  454 women entered the study of whom 16 were ineligible (wrong stage ,  n = 2 ,  wrong cell type ,  n = 9 ,  wrong primary tumor ,  n = 2 ,  prior chemotherapy ,  n = 2 ,  second primary tumor ,  n = 1) ,  which left 438 eligible patients (including 10 who received no drug ,  all were included in the intent to-treat analysis) .
It appears that studies are limited to a comparison of doxorubicin with or without vincristine and doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (n = 174) , with no difference in response rate ,  PFI ,  or survival ,  a comparison of cisplatin dose schedules ,  already referred to ,  a study of cisplatin infusion time (N = 331) ,  and a comparison of carboplatin versus iproplatin (N = 361) , with no difference in response rate ,  PFI ,  or survival .
