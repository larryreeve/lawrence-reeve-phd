The preferred treatment of women with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO IA2–IIA) is radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy .
The procedure is well tolerated ,  with minimal associated morbidity and rare mortality .
The overall prognosis for patients undergoing radical hysterectomy is good ,  with reported 5-year survival rates ranging from 75 to 90% .
However ,  among patients with a clinically early cancer ,  there are prognostic features which identify patients at increased risk for recurrence ,  recurrent cervical cancer after initial radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy has a poor prognosis ,  with a reported 5-year survival rate of 5% or less .
The clinicopathologic factors which predict a poorer prognosis for patients with an early carcinoma of the cervix have been well established .
A retrospective study of patients undergoing radical hysterectomy at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) from 1939 to 1977 identified the following risk factors ,  metastatic tumor to the pelvic lymph nodes ,  large cervical tumor ,  parametrial extension of disease ,  nonsquamous or grade 3 histology ,  and deep (.75%) cervical stromal invasion .
These factors have been shown to be associated with a high risk of recurrence in other studies ,  both from single institutions and from cooperative groups .
There have been multiple studies published which have retrospectively analyzed the outcome of patients at risk for recurrence who received adjuvant therapy compared to those patients not receiving adjuvant therapy .
Whole pelvic postoperative radiation therapy has been found to possibly decrease the incidence of local/regional recurrence with little or no effect on overall survival .
Chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation has been studied in our institution in a prospective Phase II trial ,  with an apparent improvement in survival rates when compared to historical controls .
Preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been reported as another approach to management of women with early cervical cancer and high-risk features .
Few reports have utilized adjuvant postoperative chemotherapy alone after radical surgery for invasive cervical cancer .
In an effort to determine whether the improved survival in the Memorial Hospital Phase II trial was due to the combination of chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation therapy or due to the effect of the chemotherapy alone ,  a multicenter randomized Phase III clinical trial was designed .
This report summarizes the preliminary results of the trial which closed to patient accrual in June 1994 .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Patients with clinical Stage IB–IIA cancer of the uterine cervix treated by radical hysterectomy ,  bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy ,  and aortic lymph node sampling were eligible for entry into this prospective study if they had one or more of the following risk factors ,  (1) metastatic disease to pelvic lymph nodes ,  (2) large primary tumors greater than or equal to 4 cm in diameter ,  (3) deeply invasive lesions with 75% or greater stromal invasion ,  (4) nonsquamous histology ,  and/or (5) occult parametrial involvement or positive surgical margins .
