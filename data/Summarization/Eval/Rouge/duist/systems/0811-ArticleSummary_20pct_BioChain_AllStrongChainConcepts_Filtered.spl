To date there has been no convincing evidence that any chemotherapy of colorectal cancer contributes to either the duration or the quality of life .
Although a large number of alternative drugs have been studied in colorectal cancer ,  none has exceeded the meager effectiveness of 5-FU .
The purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate ,  by such a randomized and controlled comparison ,  a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5-FU activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials .
Thymidine given at high doses in animal model systems has been shown to increase both therapeutic activity and toxicity of 5-FU and to improve the therapeutic index of this agent .
These effects presumably occur through the action of thymidine in blocking oxidative metabolism of 5-FU and increasing 5-FU incorporation into RNA .
In the study of Woodcock et al ,  the single colorectal cancer patient treated who was not a prior 5-FU failure had a response of 8 months duration .
They also observed one additional response among patients who had failed 5-FU .
The first was a small surgical adjuvant study reported by Verhaegen et al in which levamisole-treated patients had a significantly improved survival when compared with untreated controls .
If this result could be confirmed it would be the first time that any regimen has demonstrated such significant survival improvement for advanced colorectal cancer in randomized trials .
An exception to the requirement for histologic confirmation of metastasis was made in the patient with a previous histologically confirmed primary colorectal carcinoma and who presented with multiple pulmonary metastasis that had shown progression on two chest x-rays taken at least 1 month apart .
A radioactive liver scan could be used to document a measurable lesion if there was a clearly defined perfusion defect measuring at least 5 cm in greatest diameter .
Contraindications to selection included a WBC count < 4.000/mm or a platelet count < 130.000/mm. a serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL. complete disability (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group IECOG] performance score 4). recent major surgery (exploration and biopsy only. < 14 days ,  resection or bypass surgery ,  < 21 days) ,  an uncontrolled infectious process. frequent vomiting or severe anorexia ,  any previous chemotherapy ,  and intensive radiation to the axial skeleton within the preceding 4 weeks .
After determining eligibility and obtaining written informed consent ,  patients were stratified according to performance score and the presence and location of measurable disease .
For the 5-FU plus thymidine regimen ,  patients were evaluated every 4 weeks ,  while for all other regimens ,  this evaluation occurred every 5 weeks .
The evaluation consisted of a history and physical examination ,  measurement of indicator lesions. hematology and chemistry panel (including serum creatinine) ,  urinalysis ,  and a chest x-ray .
If severe toxicity had been obtained with a previous treatment course ,  drug dosages were appropriately reduced with subsequent therapy .
Treatment was continued until disease progression was documented .
The primary endpoint of our overall study was patient survival .
For the comparison of any one of our drug combinations with 5-FU. this would permit our test for treatment effect to have .90 probability of detecting a true doubling in survival time (eg. from 6 to 12 months). while having only a .05 probability of obtaining a false-positive result when there were no true differences in survival .
Standard criteria for declaring objective response were used. ie. a 5017 or greater reduction in the product of longest perpendicular diameters of bidimensionally measurable lesions or a 30% or greater decrease in the sum of liver measurements below the xyphoid process at costal margin .
The log rank statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with equality of survival curves ,  while the Cox partial likelihood score statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with the hypothesis that any one of the combinations would yield at least a 50% improvement in survival over 5-FU alone .
The primary reason for ineligibility (seven patients) was failure to confirm metastatic disease according to protocol criteria .
Four patients were lost to analysis due to ineligibility or cancellation on the 5-FU alone arm ,  four patients on 5-FU plus PALA ,  two patients on 5-FU plus thymidine ,  two patients on MOF-Strept ,  and none on 5-FU plus levamisole .
Seventy-six percent had an ECOG performance score of 0 or 1 .
Fifty-five percent had measurable disease ,  primarily in liver or lung .
MOF-Strept was characterized by substantially more frequent and more severe nausea and vomiting ,  and this was the only regimen characterized by a substantive incidence of thrombocytopenia. 5-FU plus PALA had substantially more frequent mucocutaneous reactions and somewhat more frequent diarrhea ,  but less hematologic toxicity than 5-FU alone or any of the other regimens .
On the other hand ,  5-FU plus thymidine had a reduced incidence of mucocutaneous reactions and of diarrhea with comparable hematologic toxicity when compared with 5-FU alone .
The most unique toxicity of this regimen was a substantially increased incidence of neurologic effects .
These reactions were primarily headache (seven patients) ,  lethargy (four patients) ,  dizziness with ataxia (four patients) ,  and occasional confusion (two patients) .
There were also nine patients who experienced transient hypotension following drug administration .
There were three treatment-related deaths ,  one each on 5-FU alone ,  5-FU plus thymidine ,  and MOF-Strept .
One cannot conclude that this regimen added to the quality of patient life ,  and since it did not add to duration of life ,  we must conclude that this regimen has little to recommend it .
