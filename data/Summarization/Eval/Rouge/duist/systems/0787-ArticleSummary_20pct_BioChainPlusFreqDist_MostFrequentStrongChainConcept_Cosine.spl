These doses of radiation were chosen after trials by the Veterans Administration Surgical Adjuvant Group and the Princess Margaret Hospital ,  Toronto ,  suggested survival advantage with radiotherapy for patients with tumours of Dukes stage C .
Despite the suggestion of a real biological effect of the radiotherapy in the first MRC trial ,  with significant changes in tumour stage ,  no advantage was found for either radiotherapy group over the control group in terms of disease recurrence or survival .
The importance of fixity was reflected in the survival pattern ,  5-year survival for fixed or partially fixed tumours was just 29% compared with 48% for mobile tumours .
In 1981 ,  the MRC began this trial of a higher dose of preoperative radiotherapy in patients with fixed or partially fixed tumours of the rectum who were thought to be suitable for abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection .
When an eligible patient was enrolled ,  the randomised treatment allocation was obtained by means of a telephone call to the MRC Cancer Trials Office in Cambridge .
Eligibility was confirmed and treatment allocated by minimisation on three factors ,  treatment centre ,  extension of tumour (fixed or partially fixed) ,  and intended operation (abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection) .
Survival times were not censored at 5 years ,  all surviving patients have been flagged on the OPCS central register ,  and were presumed alive on Jan 1 ,  1995 .
Recruitment into the trial started in November ,  1981 ,  and ended in November ,  1989 ,  when 279 patients had been enrolled ,  140 patients were allocated surgery alone and 139 preoperative radiotherapy (figure 1) .
Of the 139 patients who had radiotherapy and surgery 69 (50%) had fixed tumours and 70 (50%) had fixed tumours .
Abdominoperineal excision was the intended operation for about two-thirds of patients in both groups .
Nine patients received less than the prescribed dose of radiation ,  two received no radiotherapy because they were judged too ill ,  three failed to complete the full treatment because of their deteriorating condition ,  and treatment was stopped early in four patients (ischiorectal abscess and perineal breakdown ,  bowel obstruction ,  a prearranged time for surgery ,  and refusal to continue by the patient) .
Of patients who received radiotherapy ,  61 (45%) of 137 reported no significant morbidity. 45 (33%) of all patients suffered diarrhoea and 30 (22%) had skin reactions .
The distribution of type of surgery done was very similar in the two treatment groups (table 2) ,  with about half the patients in each group having abdominoperineal excision .
Nine patients allocated preoperative radiotherapy did not have surgery-seven were not fit ,  one patient refused ,  and one was not referred back after radiotherapy .
Among those who had abdominoperineal excision ,  four of 49 patients who had surgery alone who were assessable at 12 months had complications of the perineal wound compared with seven of 56 patients allocated radiotherapy .
Complications associated with the colostomy were reported in ten surgery alone patients and eight radiotherapy patients ,  and five patients in each group had anastomosis-related complications after anterior restorative resection .
The hazard ratio is 0¡¤68 (95% CI of 0.47-0.98) ,  which suggests that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by a third .
Of the 279 patients randomised ,  217 have died ,  114 (81%) of 140 patients allocated surgery alone and 103 (74%) of 139 patients allocated radiotherapy ,  median survival times are 24 months and 31 months ,  respectively .
The hazard ratio for death from any cause is 0.79 ,  giving an estimated reduction in the risk of death for patients allocated radiotherapy of 21% (log-rank p=0.10) .
Fewer deaths were reported to have been from colorectal cancer or complications of the disease or its treatment among patients allocated preoperative radiotherapy than among those allocated surgery alone (85 vs 103 ,  hazard ratio 0.71 [0.54-0.97] ,  p=0.02) .
The reasons for investigating preoperative radiation therapy were ,  reduction in size of the primary tumour and frequency of regional node metastases before resection ,  a reduction in the frequency of local pelvic recurrence and of distant metastasis from cancer cells released during resection (preoperative treatment can inhibit the proliferation of malignant cells whether they remain local or spread outside the pelvis after radiation) ,  radiation responsiveness of cancer cells may be greater before surgery when they are normally oxygenated than afterwards when they may be hypoxic because of surgical effects on the vasculature ,  and a lower frequency of late radiation enteritis because the small bowel is less likely to be adherent in the pelvis .
In line with the earlier trials we found no increased frequency of early or late complications in the patients who received radiotherapy .
Patients in the preoperative radiotherapy treatment group ,  in which a moderately high dose of radiation was to be used ,  had their surgery delayed by 2 months (1 month to cover the radiotherapy fractionation and a further month for tumour regression to occur and for the normal tissues to recover from the radiation) .
In that study of 466 patients ,  the survival benefit of 69% in the treated group versus 59% in the surgery-only group also failed to achieve statistical significance (log rank p=0.08) .
