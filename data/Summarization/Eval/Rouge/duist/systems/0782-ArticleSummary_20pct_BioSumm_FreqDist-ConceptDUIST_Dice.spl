Surgical stress ,  anaesthetics and other drugs ,  hypercoagulability ,  blood transfusions ,  and surgery-induced impairment of immune function are all reasons why the perioperative period is considered a vulnerable phase in which tumour progression is likely .
Patients were randomly assigned no adjuvant treatment (control group) or an immediate postoperative intraportal infusion of 500mg/m fluorouracil plus 5000 units heparin in 1 L 5% glucose per 24 h for 7 consecutive days (days 1-7) plus 10 mg/m mitomycin in a single dose on day 1 .
Preoperative investigations included colonoscopy or bariumenema ,  abdominal ultrasound ,  chest radiography ,  haematology ,  renal and liver function tests ,  and serum carcinoembryonic antigen measurement .
Postoperatively ,  blood counts and liver function tests were done on days 1 ,  3 ,  5 ,  7 ,  10 ,  14 ,  28 ,  and 42.Resected tissue was examined by histology and classified (Dukes' classification ,  Astler-Coller modification) .
Patients were stratified according to where the tumour was (ascending ,  transverse ,  or descending/sigmoid colon ,  or rectum) and participating clinic .
We excluded 28 patients ,  26 did not have adenocarcinoma (lymphoma ,  ovarian cancer ,  urothelial cancer ,  and others) and in 2 the protocol was violated (radiation therapy to the pelvis was added for rectal cancer) .
Examinations included blood counts ,  serum carcinoembryonic antigen measurement ,  and hepatic and renal function tests .
The 37 patients who had metastases diagnosed at surgery or had incomplete resection were regarded as having relapsed on the day of surgery. 5 patients were lost to follow-up .
Hazard ratios were derived from a proportional-hazards regression model with stratification for localisation of the tumour (colon vs rectum) and with covariates for nodal status (positive vs negative) and age (four groups ,  defined by the 25th ,  50th ,  and 75th percentiles of the age distribution of the evaluable patients-namely ,  57 ,  63 , and 69 years) .
Subgroup analyses for site of first relapse were carried out with stratification for treatment group ,  node status ,  and localisation of the tumour (colon vs rectum) .
In 41 patients (17-4%) treatment was assigned but not given because of surgery-related problems (7) ,  difficulties with catheter placement (7) ,  other technical problems (14) ,  patient refusal (2) ,  and various other reasons (11) .
After median follow-up of 8 years we were notable to confirm the overall reduction of liver metastases reported by Taylor et al. We did find ,  however ,  a consistent reduction of all kinds of tumour recurrences that resulted in a significant advantage in overall survival and disease-free survival for patients  treated with adjuvant portal infusion ,  confirming previous findings .
Previous investigations ,  with the exception of one ,  have shown improvements in overall and disease-free survival  and a reduction in the frequency of liver recurrences ,  especially in the subgroups of colon  cancer patients and of those with tumour-involved regional lymph nodes (Dukes C) .
Two as yet unpublished meta-analyses of all randomised trials comparing portal adjuvant chemotherapy with a no-treatment control group have been conducted by the European Organization on Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Oxford Colorectal Cancer Cooperative Group .
Both analyses are based on data for more than 3000 patients ,  the results show a  statistically significant overall and disease-free survival advantage for patients who received portal adjuvant therapy .
However ,  none of the studies couldc onfirm the statistically significant overall effect on the frequency of liver metastases  reported by Taylor et al. It seems likely that the effect of adjuvant portal chemotherapy on overall and disease-free survival can be attributed to the systemic effects of intraportal fluorouracil ,  which lead to a reduction in all tumour relapses (ie ,  local recurrences ,  liver metastases ,  and other distant metastases) .
Our randomised three-arm study (control vs portal vs systemic adjuvant therapy) was carried out between 1987 and 1993 in 770 patients .
Analyses of haematological toxic effects and postoperative complications show more side-effects in the systemic treatment group than in the portal or control groups .
Deaths attributable to portal adjuvant chemotherapy have been reported in at least three trials ,  1 in Taylor et al’s study due to perirectal sepsis ,  1 in Fielding and colleagues' study (a patient more than 80 years old) ,  and 1 in our trial (an insulin-dependent diabetic man who had gram-negative septicaemia and leucopenia during portal infusion) .
