Cisplatin is said to be the most active anticancer drug in cervical cancer ,  although 100 mg/m did not significantly improve the complete response (CR) rate compared prospectively with 50 mg/m (12.7 v 10% ,  respectively) and there was no appreciable difference in response duration ,  progression-free interval (PFI) ,  or survival .
Thus ,  there is no convincing reason to use a cisplatindose higher than 50 mg/m .
A phase II study of the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) demonstrated activity formitolactol as a single agent in cervical cancer using 180mg/m/d for 10 days by mouth in repeated 4-week cycles .
There were 55 assessable patients ,  with one CR and 15 partial responses (PRs) (29% response rate) .
A pilot study used mitolactol plus cisplatin and established a tolerable dose schedule of 180 mg/m of mitolactoldaily for 5 days with cisplatin 50 mg/m .
Although an intermediate dose level (50 mg/m cisplatin and 225mg/m mitolactol daily for 5 days) was considered ,  it wasnot pursued ,  since six of 10 patients at the first dose level in the pilot study required dose reductions and/or delays with re-treatment .
Treatment of cervix cancer with the combination of ifosfamide ,  cisplatin ,  and bleomycin yielded a 69% response rate (49 patients) in one series .
The result was impressive ,  but the importance of bleomycin was unclear and its toxicity sometimes troublesome ,  so we proposed to compare cisplatin alone versus a regimen of cisplatinplus mitolactol (C + M) and a regimen of cisplatin plusifosfamide (and mesna) (CIFX) .
Patients were prospectively stratified according to whether they had received prior radiation-sensitizer treatment (hydroxyurea ,  cisplatin , or fluorouracil) and by PS ,  and were then centrally randomized with equal probability to receive (1) cisplatin 50 mg/m with appropriate hydration every 3 weeks for a maximum of six courses ,  or (2) cisplatin 50 mg/m on day 1 plus mitolactol (180 mg/m orally for 5 days) on days 2 through 6 every 3 weeks ,  or (3) cisplatin 50mg/m plus ifosfamide 5.0 g/m over 24 hours plus mesna 6 g/m given concurrently with ifosfamide and for 12 hours after ,  every 3 weeks ,  again for a maximum of six courses .
Thus ,  there were 140 eligible patients on the cisplatin arm ,  147 on the C + M arm ,  and 151 onthe CIFX arm .
Peripheral (P = .013) and central neurotoxicity (P = .001) were both significantly more frequent and severe with CIFX compared with cisplatin alone (Table 3) ,  but not so for C + M .
There was no significant difference in survival between cisplatin and either of the combination regimens (median[months]: cisplatin ,  8.0;  A phase II trial of bleomycin plus ifosfamide plus cisplatin that used the same dose schedules of CIFX as in the present trial achieved a 20% CR rate .
The pilot study on which the C +M arm of the present trial was based identified 180 mg/m for 5 days as the maximum-tolerated dose in combination with cisplatin .
A survival benefit was reported in a small trial (25 patients) in favor of cisplatin plus methotrexate over hydroxyurea , but prerandomization was used ,  PS was not accounted for ,  and there may have been other imbalances in the treatment arms that could account for the difference in outcome .
