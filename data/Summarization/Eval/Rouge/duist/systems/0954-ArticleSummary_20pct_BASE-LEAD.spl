TRIALS of postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer conducted during the 1960s and 1970s showed significant reductions in rates of locoregional recurrence but no improvement in overall survival .
This result has been attributed to micrometastases ,  which determine prognosis regardless of the effect of the locoregional therapy .
Additional concern was raised by data suggesting that irradiated patients have reduced survival rates ,  due to either immune suppression or cardiac complications .
In the late 1970s ,  adjuvant chemotherapy became a standard treatment for high-risk premenopausal patients with breast cancer .
The use of adjuvant radiation subsequently declined ,  because it did not appear to prolong survival .
Nevertheless ,  there are reasons to reconsider radiotherapy ,  including the limited value of adjuvant chemotherapy for bulky disease ,  a synergistic effect of chemotherapy plus radiation on residual locoregional tumor ,  and the possibility that eliminating bulky disease with radiation may improve the effect of chemotherapy ,  because chemotherapy may be more effective when the overall disease burden is low .
To test the hypothesis that adding radiation to adjuvant systemic therapy improves the outcome in patients with breast cancer ,  we designed a randomized trial in 1978 in British Columbia .
This report presents our findings after 15 years of follow-up .
METHODS .
From 1979 through 1986 ,  318 premenopausal women with newly diagnosed stage I or II breast cancer were enrolled in the study after undergoing modified radical mastectomy if ,  after axillary-node dissection ,  one or more level I or II lymph nodes were found to be positive on pathological examination .
The mastectomy was performed according to standard surgical practice between 1979 and 1986 .
After written informed consent was obtained ,  the patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups ,  those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy plus locoregional radiotherapy in five fields (the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group ,  with 164 patients) and those receiving chemotherapy alone (the chemotherapy group ,  with 154 patients) .
The characteristics of the patients were evenly balanced ,  as Table 1 shows .
Surgery .
All the patients underwent modified radical mastectomy ,  with dissection of level I and II axillary lymph nodes .
The surgery was performed by specialists who referred all the patients to the British Columbia Cancer Agency ,  the provincial cancer institute ,  for registration ,  randomization ,  and the planning of the chemotherapy and radiation treatments .
Chemotherapy .
The chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (600 mg per square meter of body-surface area) ,  methotrexate (40 mg per square meter) ,  and fluorouracil (600 mg per square meter) (the CMF regimen) ,  given intravenously every 21 days as described by Bonadonna et al. ,  initially for 12 months (80 patients) ,  and in the case of patients randomized after 1981 ,  for 6 months .
