Purpose ,  As previously shown ,  antibody treatment increased survival of patients with resected colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C .
Since the 5-year analysis was criticized because of the wide range (2.7 to 7.5 years) of follow-up time ,  we performed a 7-year analysis with only four of 189 patients monitored for less than 5 years .
Patients and Methods ,  A total of 189 patients with resected Dukes' C colorectal cancer were randomly allocated to infusions of a total of 900 mg 17-1A antibody ,  500 mg postoperatively followed by 4 monthly doses of 100 mg (n = 99) ,  or to observation only (n = 90) .
Primary end points were overall survival and disease-free interval .
Patients were stratified by a dynamic randomization according to center ,  sex ,  location of tumor ,  number of affected lymph nodes ,  and preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen concentration .
Results ,  Randomization produced balanced distribution of risk factors .
After 7 years of follow-up evaluation ,  treatment had reduced overall mortality by 32% (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P < .01 ,  log-rank ,  P = .01) and decreased the recurrence rate by 23% (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P < .04 ,  log-rank ,  P = .07) .
The intentionto-treat analysis gave a significant effect for overall survival (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P < .01 ,  log-rank ,  P = .02) and disease-free survival (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P = .02 ,  log-rank ,  P = .1 1) .
While distant metastases were significantly reduced (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P = .004 ,  log-rank ,  P = .004) ,  local relapses were not (Cox's proportional hazard ,  P = .65 ,  log-rank ,  P = .52) .
This differential effect of 17-1A antibody on disseminated isolated tumor cells versus occult local satellites may explain the increased significance seen in the overall survival .
Conclusion ,  The now-matured study shows that 17-1A antibody administered after surgery prevents the development of distant metastasis in approximately one third of patients .
The therapeutic effect is maintained after 7 years of follow-up evaluation .
THE CURRENT PESSIMISTIC VIEW of unconjugated monoclonal antibodies as cancer therapeutics has been largely influenced by the negative outcome of multiple clinical trials initiated shortly after introduction of the hybridoma technology .
Thus ,  it comes as no surprise that recent reports on some successes obtained with antibody therapy in lymphoma ,  breast ,  and colorectal carcinoma were met with great reserve .
Wondering what the characteristic features of these trials were ,  one notes that two of these trials ,  one in lymphoma and one in breast carcinoma ,  2 had been performed with engineered antibodies ,  ie ,  either human/ murine chimeric or human complementanly defining regious (CDR)-grafted mmunoglobulins respectively ,  while the third stands out because of the target and end point used .
In contrast to other trials aimed at patients with larger metastatic tumor masses and using regression or shrinkage as the end point ,  this one on colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C required microscopically complete resection of the primary tumor for patients to be admitted.3 As the primary end point ,  overall-survival was determined at 5 years .
Here ,  we report on the 7-year follow-up study of this prospective randomized two-arm trial in minimal residual disease that used the murine 17-1A antibody ,  4 which recognizes a 34-kd glycoprotein of the cell membrane of epithelial cells.5 The 5-year analysis had shown that a short ,  albeit intensive ,  postoperative course of antibody treatment (900 mg total dose) significantly reduced the appearance of distant metastases ,  but did not affect the rate of local relapses .
However ,  local metastases may not be as innocuous as generally thought .
As recently shown for breast carcinoma ,  without regional radiation therapy ,  occult local metastases can give rise to distant metastases after many years and thus affect long-term survival. 6  , 7 Therefore ,  with no effect of antibody therapy on the local relapse at 5 years ,  It was of interest to know how the overall survival evolved at the 7-year follow-up evaluation .
This analysis also invalidated objections concerned about the maturity of the reported 5-year follow-up study .
Now ,  after a median observation time of 7 years ,  with only four of 185 patients monitored for less than 5 years ,  the study has matured and continues to demonstrate a significant benefit with regard to survival .
PATIENTS AND METHODS .
Patient Selection and Surgery .
The multicenter study consisted of six academic centers in former West Germany A total of 189 patients were randomized ,  with the first patient entered in May 1985 and the last in Apnl 1990 The study was closed in December 1992 ,  and we present here the final status with median follow-up data of 7 years Eligible patients were required to have histologically confirmed adenocarcmoma of colon or the rectum with spread to regional lymph nodes (Dukes' C or International Unimon Agamst Cancer [UICC] stage III) In addition ,  hlstopathologic confirmation of curative resection (R0) was secured Radical tumor resection was performed by a standardized technique agreed upon by all participating centers When located within 15 cm of the anal verge ,  a tumor was classified as rectal carcinoma Patients were less than 70 years old and had a Karnofsky index greater than 50% Eleven of 99 patients randomized to treatment refused their treatment assignment ,  but were otherwise considered eligible for the study .
According to Zelen ,  these patients were included in the treatment group for final analysis ,  although they had not received antibodies .
Stratification and Randomization .
After confirmation of histology and R0 resection of lymph node metastasis ,  patients were randomized into two groups one received 17-lA treatment ,  whereas the other served as observation controls .
All patients were stratified according to Zelen 8 by the following factors participating center ,  sex ,  location of tumor ,  stage (Dukes' Cl or C2 equivalent to pN1 or pN2-3) ,  number of affected lymph nodes ,  and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level before surgery (Table 1) In the treated arm ,  more patients had pT2 and pT3 tumors ,  and fewer had pT4 tumors However ,  treated patients appeared to have had higher numbers of involved lymph nodes (pN2) and tumors of less differentiated histology (grade 3) .
However ,  a Fishers' exact test ,  companng the distnbutlon of patients according to all prognostic variables ,  showed no significant differences Randomlzation before consent was performed and evaluated according to Zelen 9 On approval by legal experts in 1985 ,  this procedure was accepted by the ethical review board Statistical analyses were performed according to SAS (Statistical Analysis System ,  Cary ,  NC) To test for potential selection bias in the study ,  a retrospective analysis was performed at Medizimnische Hochschule Hannover on 67 Dukes' C colorectal cancer patients selected from 107 patients seen between 1980 and 1985 They fulfilled the entry criteria for the 17-1A clinical trial and were monitored for at least 5 years each The survival analysis was performed by the Instutut fur Medlzinische Informatlk und Blomathematlk ,  Umversltat Essen The overall survival according to Kaplan-Meier curve is nearly identical to the control group of the 17-1A trial (log-rank ,  P = 97) ,  thus ,  this historical control does not show any selection bias .
The first 5-year analysis of the study performed by the Essen biometrical center was confirmed by two independent external audits ,  both of which relied on examination of original representative record samples .
