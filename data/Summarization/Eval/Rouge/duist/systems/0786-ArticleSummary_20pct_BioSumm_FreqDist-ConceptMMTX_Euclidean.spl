RECURRENCE OF rectal cancer in the pelvis after a complete resection represents a major contributor to morbidity and subsequent mortality .
Consequently ,  the GITSG sought to assess the contribution of MeCCNU to the combined modality regimen in study GI 7180 .
An escalating single-agent 5-FU regimen incorporating a theoretical maximum-tolerated dose was chosen as the alternative treatment option based on clinical evidence suggesting a dose response curve for 5-FU and pilot data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggesting added efficacy of 5-FU when given at higher dose levels .
Randomization .
Supervoltage radiation therapy with the treatment volume to encompass the true and false pelvis was specified by the study protocol .
For all other patients ,  inclusion of the perineum in the radiation field was at the discretion of the investigator .
After the completion of radiation therapy and 5-FU ,  nochemotherapy was given for 5 weeks .
5-FU and MeCCNU .
Escalating 5-FU .
Assessment of Radiation Therapy Quality .
Variations of field placement were also categorized into minor and major clinicaldeviations .
Perineal pain ,  if preceded by a pain-free interval ,  was considered indicative of recurrence ,  and time of recurrence was listed as the time of pain onset .
Statistical Considerations .
A major goal was to assess the contribution of MeCCNU to adjuvant benefit .
All of these patients are included in the analyses .
Patient Characteristics .
Of the 199 patients who comprised the cohort for primary analysis ,  95 were randomized to receive postradiation 5-FU and MeCCNU ,  and 104 were randomized to receive postradiation escalating 5-FU .
The median age of the 199 patients analyzed was 59 years .
None of these differences were statistically significant .
Approximately one third of patients (41 of 104) randomized to the escalating 5-FU arm were escalated to at least one 5-day course of 500 mg/m of 5-FU .
Central review of compliance with radiation therapy confirmed that the majority of patients were treated as per protocol ,  with discrepancies occurring equally in each treatment arm .
In three patients the small bowel obstruction appeared to occur at an anatomic site remote from the radiation field .
Disease Recurrence .
Disease recurrence has been documented in 48% of eligible patients including 54% (51 of 95) of patient srandomized to receive 5-FU and MeCCNU and 43% (45of 104) of patients randomized to receive escalating 5-FU (Table 3) .
Of the 96 recurrent patients ,  10 died of disease without adequate documentation and were classified as recurrences by group review .
The probability of 3-year disease-free survival on the two arms is 54% and 68% for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and the escalating 5-FU arm ,  respectively ,  median time to recurrenceis estimated to be 4 years and greater than 4 years ,  respectively (Fig 1) .
After adjustment for these variables ,  the 5-FU and MeCCNU and the escalating 5-FU treatment results remained statistically indistinguishable (P = .30 , two-tailed) .
Mortality .
A total of 91 deaths have been reported ,  46% (44 of95) on 5-FU and MeCCNU and 45% (47 of 104) on 5-FU .
Six of the deaths unrelated to disease occurred in patients receiving escalating 5-FU and three in patients receiving 5-FU and MeCCNU .
Kaplan-Meier estimates of 3-year survival probabilities for patients assigned to 5-FU and MeCCNU and escalating 5-FU are 66% and 75% ,  respectively (Fig 2) .
DISCUSSION .
Although there were twice as many intestinal obstructions among patients receiving escalating 5-FU ,  no association with type of chemotherapy can be drawn from these small samples .
The risk to the patient ,  however ,  is balanced by the expected survival benefit .
Progress has clearly been made in the adjuvant treatment of rectal cancer .
The increased leukemicpotential of MeCCNU makes the drug additionally undesirable to include in the adjuvant setting .
Therefore ,  we conclude that MeCCNU is not an essential component of effective postoperative combined modality treatment of adjuvant rectal cancer and should not be included in future treatment regimens .
