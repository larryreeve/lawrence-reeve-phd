However ,  among patients with a clinically early cancer ,  there are prognostic features which identify patients at increased risk for recurrence ,  recurrent cervical cancer after initial radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy has a poor prognosis ,  with a reported 5-year survival rate of 5% or less .
A retrospective study of patients undergoing radical hysterectomy at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) from 1939 to 1977 identified the following risk factors ,  metastatic tumor to the pelvic lymph nodes ,  large cervical tumor ,  parametrial extension of disease ,  nonsquamous or grade 3 histology ,  and deep (.75%) cervical stromal invasion .
In an effort to determine whether the improved survival in the Memorial Hospital Phase II trial was due to the combination of chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation therapy or due to the effect of the chemotherapy alone ,  a multicenter randomized Phase III clinical trial was designed .
Patients with clinical Stage IB–IIA cancer of the uterine cervix treated by radical hysterectomy ,  bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy ,  and aortic lymph node sampling were eligible for entry into this prospective study if they had one or more of the following risk factors ,  (1) metastatic disease to pelvic lymph nodes ,  (2) large primary tumors greater than or equal to 4 cm in diameter ,  (3) deeply invasive lesions with 75% or greater stromal invasion ,  (4) nonsquamous histology ,  and/or (5) occult parametrial involvement or positive surgical margins .
One arm consisted of 2 cycles of chemotherapy (given 3–4 weeks apart) utilizing bleomycin 20 U/m2/day via continuous 24-hr infusion on Days 1–3 after an initial intravenous bolus of 20 U/m2 followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 by iv infusion on Day 4 .
Following recovery from the second cycle of chemotherapy ,  patients received a course of whole pelvic radiation therapy to a dose of 45 Gy ,  delivered in 20 fractions via a four-field technique ,  patients did not receive intravaginal therapy .
In the second arm of the study ,  patients were randomized to treatment with a similar regimen of chemotherapy as described above without pelvic radiation ,  following the first two cycles of cisplatin and bleomycin ,  the patient then received the third and fourth treatment of cisplatin alone at 3-to 4-week intervals .
Additional entry criteria included histologic confirmation of negative para-aortic lymph nodes ,  normal renal function (creatinine clearance of greater than 60 ml/min) ,  normal liver function tests ,  hemoglobin of greater than 8.0 g/dl ,  and a normal DLCO pulmonary function test .
Forty-five patients were randomized to the chemotherapy withdrawn by the institutional principal investigator due to plus radiation therapy treatment arm and 44 patients received poor medical condition of the patient (n ? 1) .
There were 12 major protocol viola-patients received only a portion of the proscribed treatment ,  tions ,  including 7 patients who were randomized (6 to che-one patient ,  randomized to chemotherapy ,  withdrew after chemotherapy plus radiation therapy and 1 patient to chemother-experiencing an allergic bleomycin reaction during the initial chemotherapy alone) and then either refused treatment (n ?6) or were infusion of bleomycin during cycle 1 .

Among patients with 3 or more risk factors ,  there was also no differ-The debate regarding the role of adjuvant therapy for paence in the disease-free survival or overall survival when tients at high risk for recurrence after radical hysterectomy compared to patients with 1–2 risk factors (Fig. 3) .
Major toxicity suggest that a 65% 5-year survival rate after therapy combinincluded one patient who did not receive the second cycle ing radical hysterectomy ,  pelvic lymphadenectomy ,  and of bleomycin due to the onset of pulmonary symptoms and postoperative pelvic radiotherapy for patients with pelvic a significant decrease in pulmonary function compared to a lymph node metastases is an improvement compared to his-pretreatment study .
The analysis of the data from the 89 patients entered is not able to document that the two treatments are equivalent ,  but must be taken to suggest that the likelihood of finding a significant difference between these two treatment modalities in a full trial of 160 patients is small .
Investigators who design adjuvant trials for patients at high risk for recurrence after radical hysterectomy for invasive cervical cancer must balance the potential benefit to be gained by a minority of patients against the risks inherent in treating all patients .
