By contrast ,  radical surgery affords the opportunity to study pathological findings ,  so that groups of at-risk patients who could benefit from adjuvant treatment can be identified .
Eligibility criteria were ,  age 30–70 years ,  newly diagnosed stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  no concurrent or previous malignant disease ,  WHO performance status of 1 or less ,  and feasibility of both radical surgery and radiotherapy .
Radiotherapy included ,  external pelvic irradiation with 18 MV photon beam by the multiportal technique ,  one dose of 1·8–2·0Gy at the isocentre ,  and two or more portals treated daily .
Radical surgery consisted of a class III radical abdominal hysterectomy ,  as described by Piver and co-workers .
Adjuvant radiotherapy consisted of external pelvic irradiation (18 MV X-rays) with the multiportal technique ,  one fraction of 1·8–2·0 Gy daily ,  with a total dose of 50·4 Gy over 5–6 weeks .
We classified complications as ,  grade 1 ,  mild symptoms not affecting the patient’s health and easily cured ,  grade 2 ,  symptoms that can be resolved by long-term medical therapies ,  grade 3 ,  major symptoms that require surgery or invasive procedures and affect the performance status of the patient ,  or fatal complications .
Of the 468 patients with FIGO stage Ib or IIa cervical cancer ,  125 were excluded because of age (<30 years ,  >70 years ,  n=43) ,  medical illness (n=54) ,  previous or concurrent malignant disease (n=21) ,  or the referring physician’s or patient’s preference for surgery ,  radiotherapy ,  or chemoradiotherapy (n=7) .
After randomisation ,  there were six protocol violations ,  two in the surgery group (one progression before operation and one refusal of any therapy after randomisation) and four in the radiotherapy group (two patients whose cancer was incorrectly staged and two with synchronous neoplasia) .
Ten patients crossed over treatment ,  one refused surgery and was irradiated ,  and nine refused radiotherapy and underwent surgery .
Five patients in the radiotherapy group did not receive brachyradiotherapy after external irradiation because of unfavourable anatomy and subsequently underwent radical surgery .
Lymphangiography revealed positive nodes in 24 (14%) surgery-group patients and in 22 (13%) radiotherapy group patients .
Adjuvant radiotherapy was done in 62 (54%) of the 114 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter of 4 cm or smaller and in 46 (84%) of 55 surgery-group patients who had a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm. 19 patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or less and three patients whose cervical diameter was greater than 4 cm had lymph-vascular-space involvement as the only pathological risk factor ,  these patients did not receive postoperative irradiation .
For rates of adenocarcinoma there was a significant advantage for patients who had surgery compared with those who had radiotherapy in both overall survival (70% vs 59% ,  p=0·05) and disease-free survival (66% vs 47% ,  p=0·02) .
In addition ,  among women with a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm ,  there was a significantly higher rate of pelvic relapse among those who had radiotherapy than among those who had surgery plus adjuvant irradiation (16 [70%] vs 9 [53%] ,  p=0·46) .
Grade 2 or 3 complications affected 19 (31%) patients who had surgery alone and 29 (27%) patients who received surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy (p=0·71) .
Three (1·7%) surgery-group patients had perioperative complications ,  one vascular lesion during lymphadenectomy ,  one postoperative ureterovaginal fistula ,  and one fatal pulmonary embolism .
Chronic neurological bladder was observed in eight (13%) patients who had surgery alone and in five (5%) patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy .
Other vesical complications (severe actinic cystitis ,  stress incontinence ,  high-pressure bladder) were recorded in two (3%) patients after surgery ,  11 (10%) after surgery plus radiotherapy ,  and in eight (5%) after radiotherapy alone .
Ileal obstruction occurred in six (5%) patients who underwent surgery plus radiotherapy and in two (1%) who received radical radiotherapy .
In the radiotherapy group ,  one patient had intestinal perforation ,  one rectovaginal fistula ,  and 12 severe proctites.Severe oedema of the legs occurred in ten (9%) patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy ,  in one (0·6%) patient who had radiotherapy alone ,  and in none of the patients who had surgery alone .
Morley and Seski’s study ,  of 446 patients with stage-Ib disease recruited between 1945 and 1975 and treated with radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy or external irradiation and brachyradiotherapy ,  reported crude 5-year survival of 87% and 83% ,  respectively .
Surgery also offers other advantages ,  pelvic relapses can be successfully cured by radiotherapy ,  whereas salvage surgery after primary irradiation carries a high rate of failures and severe morbidity .
Hydroureteronephroses ,  oedema of the lower limbs ,  various vesical complications ,  and bowel morbidity are more common and compromising in women who undergo surgery plus radiotherapy .
Our study was not aimed to assess the usefulness of the postoperative treatment ,  though our finding that patients treated with surgery plus radiotherapy were exposed to early and late complicationsof both treatments is important .
Clinical prognostic factors can prove useful to select those patients who should be treated primarily by irradiation ,  reserving surgery for patients who do not need adjuvant treatment .
In Italy ,  a prospective randomised trial has been under way since 1993 to assess the best adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) for high-risk patients after radical surgery for FIGO stage Ib–IIa cancer .
Improvements in local control and survival could be achieved by combined treatments ,  which would avoid the discomforting complications associated with surgery plus radiotherapy .
Most women with stage Ib–IIa cervical cancer can be treated successfully with radiotherapy ,  whereas a judicious selection of patients is necessary before planning primary radical surgery .
Women whose cervical diameters are larger than 4 cm should be identified before surgery so that they can benefit from tailored treatment ,  radical radiotherapy ,  with the option of concomitant radiosensitising chemotherapy to improve the local control of the disease ,  or cisplatinbased chemotherapy followed by radical surgery .
