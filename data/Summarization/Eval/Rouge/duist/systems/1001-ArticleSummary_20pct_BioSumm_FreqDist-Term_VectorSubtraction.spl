Purpose ,  As previously shown ,  antibody treatment increased survival of patients with resected colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C .
Primary end points were overall survival and disease-free interval .
Results ,  Randomization produced balanced distribution of risk factors .
Conclusion ,  The now-matured study shows that 17-1A antibody administered after surgery prevents the development of distant metastasis in approximately one third of patients .
This analysis also invalidated objections concerned about the maturity of the reported 5-year follow-up study .
PATIENTS AND METHODS .
Patient Selection and Surgery .
Stratification and Randomization .
Protocol Management .
Protocol management has been described in detail previously .
Antibody and Antigen .
Patients and Causes of Ineligibility .
A final status of 185 patients could be obtained for this analysis .
Survival .
The death rate of the observed group was 63% (48 of 76 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  48 to 78) of patients and that of the treated group was 43% (39 of 90 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  31 to 58) .
Recurrence .
The calculated recurrence rate was 68% (49 of 76 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  53 to 82) m the control group and 52% (47 of 90 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  39 to 67) in the 17-1A group .
In this analysis ,  data on patients who died without recurrence were censored .
Pattern of Recurrence .
Toxicity .
Immune Response to 17-1A Antibody .
Patients who developed recurrences and those who remained tumorfree did not show a difference in antibody titers .
As will be reported elsewhere ,  the serum levels of antiidlotyplc antibodies (Ab2) showed no significant differences between the analyzed patients who remained tumor free (n = 30) or experienced a relapse (n = 30) .
DISCUSSION .
These findings were confirmed by another cooperative group .
The dose of antibody chosen deserves a special comment .
Similar high doses were used in the lymphoma trial cited earlier .
Antildiotype antibodies were detected in most HAMA-posltive samples .
Thus far ,  this assay has been negative .
Immunohistochemical staining of the primary tumor had shown that the antigen is expressed by most ,  but not all cells within an individual tumor .
They do not only possess extended serum half-lives ,  but also harness human effector mechanisms much more efficiently than murine immunoglobulihns can do .
