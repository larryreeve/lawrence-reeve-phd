Efforts to overcome this problem have included the use of large-particle radiotherapy ,  the use of different radiation-fractionation schedules ,  and the concurrent use of hyperthermia or chemotherapy .
Theoretically ,  chemotherapy and radiotherapy could have a synergistic effect ,  for example ,  the chemotherapy might increase the sensitivity of the tumor to radiation .
Moreover ,  radiotherapy could be used for local disease while chemotherapy is used for systemic disease .
The concurrent use of single-drug and multiple-drug regimens with radiotherapy has been tested in women with cervical cancer ,  but combination therapy has not gained wide acceptance .
The Gynecologic Oncology Group has performed several prospective ,  randomized studies of the effect of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in women with locally advanced cervical cancer .
Radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea has been compared in separate trials with radiotherapy alone ,  with radiotherapy and concomitant therapy with misonidazole ,  and with radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil (and Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) .
As compared with radiotherapy alone ,  treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy significantly increased the rate of complete response ,  progression-free survival ,  and overall survival .
As compared with treatment with misonidazole and radiotherapy ,  treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy increased progression-free survival and was less toxic .
However ,  treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and radiotherapy resulted in greater improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival than did treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy (Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) .
At the time we were developing the protocol used in the current study ,  radiotherapy plus concomitant chemotherapy with hydroxyurea was the standard combined-therapy regimen for advanced cervical cancer ,  because an early analysis of the combination of radiation ,  cisplatin ,  and fluorouracil failed to show improved progression-free survival .
Radiotherapy was administered to the whole pelvic region in 24 fractions totaling 40.8 Gy or 30 fractions totaling 51.0 Gy ,  followed one to three weeks later by intracavitary brachytherapy (the insertion of a radioactive implant) .
The total dose delivered to point A (a reference location 2 cm lateral and 2 cm superior to the cervical os) was 80.8 Gy in patients with stage IIB and 81.0 Gy in patients with stage III or IVA disease ,  the total dose delivered to point B (the pelvic wall) was 55.0 Gy in patients with stage IIB disease and 60.0 Gy in patients with stage III or IVA disease .
Pelvic radiation was delivered by anteroposterior and posteroanterior parallel ports or a four-field box technique (anteroposterior ,  posteroanterior ,  and two lateral fields) with an x-ray energy of at least 4-MV photons .
We calculated the target sample size of 165 patients for each regimen on the basis of an ability to detect a 35 percent decrease in the rate of disease progression with the use of either radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin or radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea .
The Cox model was used to adjust for prognostic factors and to estimate the relative likelihood (and 95 percent confidence intervals) of survival and progression-free survival .
From April 1992 to April 1997 ,  575 patients were enrolled ,  192 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin ,  191 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 192 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with hydroxyurea .
Forty-nine of these patients (9 percent) were subsequently found to be ineligible for the following reasons ,  because of deviations from the surgical protocol for the evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (44 patients) ,  ineligible stage of disease (2) ,  metastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes (1) ,  incorrect primary diagnosis (1) ,  and incomplete pretreatment testing (1) .
The relative risk of progression of disease or death was 0.57 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.42 to 0.78) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0.55 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.40 to 0.75) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy ,  after adjustment for the clinical stage of disease .
After adjustment for these five factors ,  the relative risks of disease progression for the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea were extremely close (relative risks ,  0.58 and 0.55 ,  respectively) to the estimates obtained after adjustment for clinical stage of disease alone .
After adjustment for the clinical stage of disease ,  the relative risk of death was 0.61 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.44 to 0.85) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0.58 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.41 to 0.81) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
Survival rates were also significantly better in these two groups (P=0.004 and P=0.002 ,  respectively) than in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy (Fig. 2) .
Patients in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea had less local progression (19 percent and 20 percent ,  respectively) than those in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy (30 percent) .
Eight patients did not receive any radiation therapy ,  and 41 (8 percent) received only external-beam treatment ,  but these 49 patients were evenly distributed among the three treatment groups .
The number of patients who received within 15 percent of the prescribed total dose to both point A (69 to 93 Gy) and point B (stage IIB ,  47 to 63 Gy ,  stage III or IVA ,  51 to 59 Gy) was 159 (90 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  147 (85 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 149 (84 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
The median duration of treatment was 9.0 weeks (10th and 90th percentiles ,  7.1 and 11.9 ,  respectively) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  9.3 weeks (10th and 90th percentiles ,  7.6 and 11.6) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 8.9 weeks (10th and 90th percentiles ,  7.2 and 11.2) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
The median delay was 8 days (the 10th percentile was a time 2 days ahead of schedule ,  and the 90th percentile was a delay of 22 days) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  10 days (10th and 90th percentiles ,  1 and 26) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 8 days (10th and 90th percentiles ,  1 day ahead of schedule and a delay of 23 days) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
However ,  in a small study of 45 patients with cervical cancer ,  radiotherapy and chemotherapy with cisplatin (25 mg per square meter per week) increased the rate of local control by 35 percent (P<0.025 for the comparison with radiotherapy alone) ,  but there was no long-term improvement in survival .
In a phase 3 trial conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group ,  388 patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy either with cisplatin and fluorouracil or with hydroxyurea (Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) ,  the two-drug regimen improved survival (relative risk of death ,  0.74 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.58 to 0.95) .
In the phase 3 study by Morris et al. ,  whose results are reported in this issue of the Journal ,  radiotherapy in combination with treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil significantly improved the rates of disease-free survival and overall survival among women with stage IB through IVA cervical cancer .
