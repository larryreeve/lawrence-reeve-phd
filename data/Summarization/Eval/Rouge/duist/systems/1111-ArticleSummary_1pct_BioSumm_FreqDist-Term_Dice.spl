In 1988 the GOG initiated a prospective randomized study (GOG #92) ,  reported here ,  to investigate the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy for Stage I cervical cancer patients treated by conventional radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who were at high risk for recurrence ,  because of LTD ,  DSI ,  CLS ,  but excluding patients with lymph node metastases .
The GOG #92 multicenter prospective randomized study was designed to determine whether postoperative pelvic radiotherapy following radical hysterectomy and pelvic node dissection would reduce the rate of recurrence and decrease the mortality in Stage IB cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter ,  deep stromal invasion by tumor ,  and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces found on microscopic examination .
