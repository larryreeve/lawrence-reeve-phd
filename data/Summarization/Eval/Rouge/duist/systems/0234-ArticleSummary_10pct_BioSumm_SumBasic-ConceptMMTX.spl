The antitumor activity of EPI in animal models is similar to that of DOX ,  but EPI is a less toxic compound with regard to both cytotoxicity and cardiac injury .
Pretreatment Evaluation and Follow-up Studies Pretreatment evaluation of patients included complete history and physical examination ,  complete blood cell count (CBC) ,  12-channel biochemical profile ,  serum creatinine ,  chest roentgenogram ,  ECG ,  and bone scan .
Patients were stratified for performance status (Karnofsky scale < 70% v > 80%) and for estrogen receptor status of the primary or a metastatic lesion (positive or unknown v negative) .
Statistical MethodsComparison of response rates between the two arms was made using a chi-square test .
Eight patients on the EPI arm and 14 on the DOX arm had received prior radiotherapy to the chest ,  mediastinum ,  or thoracic spine that may have exposed the myocardium to ionizing radiation .
In addition ,  four patients who received EPI and six who received DOX had a history of wellcontrolled systemic arterial hypertension .
Although all patients had received prior chemotherapy which included cyclophosphamide or other alkylating agent ,  no patient had been previously treated with mitomycin C .
There was no difference (log rank test ,  P = .90) in the median time to progression between the patients on the EPI arm (3.9 months) and those on the DOX arm (5.1 months) .
Because all patients had been treated previously with chemotherapy ,  the degree and incidence of alopecia is difficult to assess ,  however ,  hair loss was noted in 50% of patients treated with EPI and 35% of those treated with DOX .
Nor did all patients experience a steady progressive decline in LVEF ,  most maintained a stable LVEF until there was an acute decrease .
Of the patients who developed symptomatic CHF on the EPI arm ,  one had prior radiotherapy and one had hypertension .
Among patients who experienced clinical CHF ,  however ,  the median cumulative doses to CHF were 1,134 mg/m2 of EPI and 492 mg/m 2 of DOX .
Thirteen percent of patients in another recent study developed CHF at a median dose of 405 mg/m 2 when DOX was given on an every three week schedule. 22 With optimal monitoring ,  one might be able to detect subclinical cardiac injury and prevent CHF by stopping the drug ,  this implies ,  however ,  the interruption of effective antineoplastic therapy .
Two recent studies that used endomyocardial biopsy have demonstrated that a larger total cumulative dose of DOX can be tolerated if the drug is given weekly or by continuous intravenous infusion .
Structurally ,  EPI differsvery slightly from DOX and has the same molecular weight ,  yet EPI and DOX have different therapeutic ,  myelosuppressive ,  and  cardiotoxic potencies in animal systems .
The observed major therapeutic response rate to EPI (25%) was identical to that observed with DOX (25%) .
Although these results could have been affected by the greater incidence of cardiac irradiation inpatients treated with DOX ,  only three patients who had received such radiotherapy actually developed CHF ,  one on the EPI arm and two on the DOX arm .
In the murine tumor model systems ,  equal doses of EPI and DOX produce equal therapeutic effects with less host toxicity in the EPI-treated mice ,  but a clinical assessment can only be based on studies in humans .
Brambilla and coworkers in Milan33 studied equal doses (75 mg/m2) of both drugs every three weeks ,  they limited the total cumulative dose of each drug to 600 mg/m2 .
In this study ,  worsening cardiac function forced the premature discontinuation of DOX therapy in three patients experiencing partial responses ,  whereas effective treatment with EPI was never discontinued because of cardiac toxicity .
