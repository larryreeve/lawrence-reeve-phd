Introduction .
Adjuvant chemotherapy of colorectal cancer has been tested in several randomised trials .
Liver metastases are observed at diagnosis of primary colorectal cancer in 25-30% of patients .
Overt liver metastases seem to be the first site of relapse for 40-50%of patients with operable disease .
Intraportal injection of cytotoxic agents at the time of surgery for colorectal cancer was advocated in 1957 to prevent liver metastases .
Interest in this treatment was stimulated by the promising findings of a 1979 randomised study .
We report long-term results here .
Access to the portal vein was through any side branch of the mesenteric venous system .
All randomised patients were followed up for recurrence and survival every 3 months for 1 year then every 6 months .
Results .
At median follow-up of 96 months ,  235 patients had died ,  108 in the infusion group and 127 in the control group. 5-year overall survival was also higher in the infusion group (table 2) .
The advantage is most pronounced around 5 years after randomisation .
Treatment outcome was similar in all subgroups ,  and was best in that with positive nodes .
Discussion .
This trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase survival in patients with colorectal cancer .
This effect was observed in all subgroups ,  but was greatest in patients with tumour-involved lymph nodes (33%) and in those with colon cancer (22%) .
We know of at least twelve prospective controlled studies with a similar design .
In two trials intraportal treatment was compared with systemic cytotoxic drugs .
We have investigated this hypothesis in a second clinical trial .
