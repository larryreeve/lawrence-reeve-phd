In retrospective studies ,  the incidence of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) was estimated to be approximately 3% to 4% after a cumulative DOX dose of 450 mg/m2 and 6% to 10% after 550 mg/m2 ,  the incidence of CHF rises steeply after higher cumulative doses.On the basis of these retrospective studies ,  an empiric dose limitation of 450 to 550 mg/m2 has been recommended when DOX is used on a standard every three week schedule .
Other criteria for eligibility included a performance status of - 50% (Karnofsky scale) ,  a WBC count - 4,000/14L ,  a platelet count >- 100,000/L ,  normal serum bilirubin levels ( < 1.5 mg/dL) ,  and objectively evaluable or measurable disease .
Pretreatment Evaluation and Follow-up Studies Pretreatment evaluation of patients included complete history and physical examination ,  complete blood cell count (CBC) ,  12-channel biochemical profile ,  serum creatinine ,  chest roentgenogram ,  ECG ,  and bone scan .
After imageswere obtained at rest for six minutes ,  supine bicycle exercise was started with graded increment in exercise load and monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure .
The additional patient randomized to EPI died with progressive breast cancer and nadir sepsis 15 days after her first dose of EPI ,  she is excluded from analysis of therapeutic results ,  but is included in the analysis of hematologic toxicity .
There was no difference (log rank test ,  P = .90) in the median time to progression between the patients on the EPI arm (3.9 months) and those on the DOX arm (5.1 months) .
Thirteen percent of patients in another recent study developed CHF at a median dose of 405 mg/m 2 when DOX was given on an every three week schedule. 22 With optimal monitoring ,  one might be able to detect subclinical cardiac injury and prevent CHF by stopping the drug ,  this implies ,  however ,  the interruption of effective antineoplastic therapy .
The difference in cardiac toxicity was manifested by the difference in total cumulative dose at which changes in LVEF occurred (Fig 2A) ,  as well as by the difference in dose at which clinical CHF was seen (EPI ,  1,035 to 1,234 mg/m 2 v DOX ,  456 to 600 mg/m2) .
Although these results could have been affected by the greater incidence of cardiac irradiation inpatients treated with DOX ,  only three patients who had received such radiotherapy actually developed CHF ,  one on the EPI arm and two on the DOX arm .
In the murine tumor model systems ,  equal doses of EPI and DOX produce equal therapeutic effects with less host toxicity in the EPI-treated mice ,  but a clinical assessment can only be based on studies in humans .
In the present study ,  each drug was given every three weeks in doses that produced equivalent degrees of myelosuppression ,  a preplanned limitation on the total cumulative dose of EPI was not used .
A third study34 compared two multidrug combinations in which 5-fluorouracil (F) 500 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide (C) 500 mg/m2 were combined with an equal dosage (50 mg/m2) of either EPI (FEC [5-fluorouracil ,  EPI ,  cyclophosphamidel) or DOX (FAC) and administered every three weeks ,  the total dose of EPI was limited to 750 mg/m2 and of DOX to 550 mg/m2 .
In contrast ,  the present study predicts an incidence of laboratory cardiotoxicity in excess of 70% for those patients who receive more than 600 mg/m2 of DOX .
Most patients in our trials received less than 550 mg/m2 of EPI ,  however ,  in 11 patients receiving cumulative EPI doses from 550 to 1,465 mg/m2 ,  RNCA abnormalities were observed in only four patients at 970 ,  1,180,1,190 ,  and 1,465 mg/m2 ,  respectively (C.W .
Although the patients studied were heterogeneous ,  the data were subjected to multivariate analysis with regard to dose ,  prior cardiac irradiation ,  and schedule of drug administration .
Although at times a decrease in LVEF was observed immediately before the development of CHF ,  we were unable to confirm the previously described pattern of predictable progressive decline in LVEF over time for all patients.6 Many patients maintained their left ventricular function at the baseline value until it worsened abruptly shortly before or at the time that clinical CHF was observed .
The sudden onset of clinical deterioration was also reported byBristow who considered this a manifestation of a nonlinear relationship between myocardial structure and function.3 6 Likewise ,  changes in LVEF in response to stress frequently accompanied a decline in LVEF ,  but we did not observe such a decline without a concommittant change in resting LVEF .
Our results show that EPI has therapeutic activity that is similar to that of DOX in patients with advanced breast cancer ,  and that EPI is a less cardiotoxic drug than DOX ,  even accounting for the difference in myelosuppressive potency .
In this study ,  worsening cardiac function forced the premature discontinuation of DOX therapy in three patients experiencing partial responses ,  whereas effective treatment with EPI was never discontinued because of cardiac toxicity .
In addition ,  the preliminary results from the FEC v FAC combination chemotherapy trial suggest that EPI should be studied further in combination with other active agents in patients with advanced breast cancer .
