Theoretically ,  chemotherapy and radiotherapy could have a synergistic effect ,  for example ,  the chemotherapy might increase the sensitivity of the tumor to radiation .
Moreover ,  radiotherapy could be used for local disease while chemotherapy is used for systemic disease .
The Gynecologic Oncology Group has performed several prospective ,  randomized studies of the effect of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in women with locally advanced cervical cancer .
Radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea has been compared in separate trials with radiotherapy alone ,  with radiotherapy and concomitant therapy with misonidazole ,  and with radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil (and Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) .
As compared with radiotherapy alone ,  treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy significantly increased the rate of complete response ,  progression-free survival ,  and overall survival .
As compared with treatment with misonidazole and radiotherapy ,  treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy increased progression-free survival and was less toxic .
However ,  treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and radiotherapy resulted in greater improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival than did treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy (Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) .
At the time we were developing the protocol used in the current study ,  radiotherapy plus concomitant chemotherapy with hydroxyurea was the standard combined-therapy regimen for advanced cervical cancer ,  because an early analysis of the combination of radiation ,  cisplatin ,  and fluorouracil failed to show improved progression-free survival .
Therefore ,  we undertook a randomized study in which all women with locally advanced cervical cancer received local radiation as well as weekly concomitant treatment with cisplatin alone ,  the combination of cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  or hydroxyurea alone .
Radiotherapy was withheld if a patient had a leukocyte count of less than 2000 per cubic millimeter ,  and delays of up to one week were also allowed in the event of radiation-related gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicity .
We calculated the target sample size of 165 patients for each regimen on the basis of an ability to detect a 35 percent decrease in the rate of disease progression with the use of either radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin or radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea .
From April 1992 to April 1997 ,  575 patients were enrolled ,  192 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin ,  191 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 192 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with hydroxyurea .
The relative risk of progression of disease or death was 0.57 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.42 to 0.78) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0.55 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.40 to 0.75) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy ,  after adjustment for the clinical stage of disease .
After adjustment for these five factors ,  the relative risks of disease progression for the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea were extremely close (relative risks ,  0.58 and 0.55 ,  respectively) to the estimates obtained after adjustment for clinical stage of disease alone .
The rates of progression-free survival at 24 months were 67 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  64 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 47 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
After adjustment for the clinical stage of disease ,  the relative risk of death was 0.61 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.44 to 0.85) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0.58 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.41 to 0.81) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
Patients in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea had less local progression (19 percent and 20 percent ,  respectively) than those in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy (30 percent) .
Patients in the two cisplatin-treated groups also had a lower frequency of lung metastases (3 percent and 4 percent ,  respectively) than patients treated with hydroxyurea alone (10 percent) .
Eight patients did not receive any radiation therapy ,  and 41 (8 percent) received only external-beam treatment ,  but these 49 patients were evenly distributed among the three treatment groups .
The number of patients who received within 15 percent of the prescribed total dose to both point A (69 to 93 Gy) and point B (stage IIB ,  47 to 63 Gy ,  stage III or IVA ,  51 to 59 Gy) was 159 (90 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  147 (85 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 149 (84 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
The median duration of treatment was 9.0 weeks (10th and 90th percentiles ,  7.1 and 11.9 ,  respectively) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  9.3 weeks (10th and 90th percentiles ,  7.6 and 11.6) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 8.9 weeks (10th and 90th percentiles ,  7.2 and 11.2) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
The median delay was 8 days (the 10th percentile was a time 2 days ahead of schedule ,  and the 90th percentile was a delay of 22 days) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy ,  10 days (10th and 90th percentiles ,  1 and 26) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea ,  and 8 days (10th and 90th percentiles ,  1 day ahead of schedule and a delay of 23 days) in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy .
The frequencies of other hematologic effects of both grade 3 and grade 4 - predominantly granulocytopenia - in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea therapy were approximately double those in the other two groups (P<0.001) .
In a study of 19 human cervical-cancer cell lines ,  Britten et al. found that radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin increased the rates of death of these tumor cells .
However ,  in a small study of 45 patients with cervical cancer ,  radiotherapy and chemotherapy with cisplatin (25 mg per square meter per week) increased the rate of local control by 35 percent (P<0.025 for the comparison with radiotherapy alone) ,  but there was no long-term improvement in survival .
In a phase 3 trial conducted by the Gynecologic Oncology Group ,  388 patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy either with cisplatin and fluorouracil or with hydroxyurea (Whitney CW ,  unpublished data) ,  the two-drug regimen improved survival (relative risk of death ,  0.74 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.58 to 0.95) .
In the phase 3 study by Morris et al. ,  whose results are reported in this issue of the Journal ,  radiotherapy in combination with treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil significantly improved the rates of disease-free survival and overall survival among women with stage IB through IVA cervical cancer .
Souhami et al. used radiotherapy concurrently with treatment with cisplatin ,  followed by high-dose brachytherapy ,  to treat 50 patients with cervical cancer .
Our results demonstrate the superiority of radiotherapy and chemotherapy either with cisplatin alone or with cisplatin ,  fluorouracil ,  and hydroxyurea in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (stage IIB ,  III ,  or IVA without metastasis to the para-aortic lymph nodes) .
