The first UK Medical Research Council (MRC) trial of preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer was a three-arm randomised trial with 824 patients comparing a control (surgery alone) group with a group treated with 20 Gy given in 10 equal fractions and another treated with a single exposure of 5 Gy .
These doses of radiation were chosen after trials by the Veterans Administration Surgical Adjuvant Group and the Princess Margaret Hospital ,  Toronto ,  suggested survival advantage with radiotherapy for patients with tumours of Dukes stage C .
The importance of fixity was reflected in the survival pattern ,  5-year survival for fixed or partially fixed tumours was just 29% compared with 48% for mobile tumours .
Eligible patients were men or women younger than 80 years who ,  had histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum partially or totally fixed within the pelvis with the lower margin of the tumour within 15 cm of the anal verge ,  were deemed suitable and fit for the proposed treatment and available for regular follow-up ,  were free of disseminated disease (confirmed by clinical and radiological examination) ,  and had had no previous malignant disease .
At each visit ,  the status of the abdominal and perineal wounds was assessed ,  late complications of treatment recorded ,  and evidence of local or distant recurrence noted .
Criteria for suspicion of local recurrence were pain ,  increasing in severity and requiring medication ,  or disturbance of bladder function ,  induration in the perineum or pelvis on examination ,  or palpation of a mass in the pelvis or at the anastomosis .
Event-free times were recorded from the date of randomisation .
We decided to continue the trial only until the launch ,  in November ,  1989 ,  of the UK Coordinating Committee on Cancer Research (UKCCCR) adjuvant X-ray and fluorouracil infusion study (AXIS) for treatment of colorectal cancer .
Abdominoperineal excision was the intended operation for about two-thirds of patients in both groups .
The proportion of tumours graded as Dukes C was significantly lower in the radiotherapy group than in the surgery alone group (29 vs 59% ,  p.0.0002) and the number of involved lymph nodes was also smaller .
The hazard ratio is 0¡¤68 (95% CI of 0.47-0.98) ,  which suggests that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by a third .
Median follow-up time for the patients who survived is 10 years .
However ,  cause-specific survival analysis suggests a larger benefit for radiotherapy .
Fewer deaths were reported to have been from colorectal cancer or complications of the disease or its treatment among patients allocated preoperative radiotherapy than among those allocated surgery alone (85 vs 103 ,  hazard ratio 0.71 [0.54-0.97] ,  p=0.02) .
Patients in the preoperative radiotherapy treatment group ,  in which a moderately high dose of radiation was to be used ,  had their surgery delayed by 2 months (1 month to cover the radiotherapy fractionation and a further month for tumour regression to occur and for the normal tissues to recover from the radiation) .
Several Swedish studies have advanced the case for the use of preoperative rather than postoperative radiation in terms of better patient compliance ,  greater reduction in local recurrence rates ,  and lower morbidity .
Moreover ,  current practice is to give a short course of high-dose radiation (25 Gy over 5.7 days) and to proceed to immediate surgery ,  thus avoiding the long delay before surgery .
Since the trial was closed ,  surgeons have been entering patients in large numbers into the AXIS trial in which there is randomisation with respect to preoperative radiation for patients with rectal cancer ,  with the Swedish model of short ,  high-dose therapy .
