Nevertheless ,  there is little evidence of effective therapy for such patients other than symptomatic and supportive care. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is considered by many as the standard of chemotherapy ,  but in larger experiences with this agent ,  response rates have only been in the 15% to 20% range .
A hope frequently pursued in clinical research has been that the activity of 5-FU can be enhanced either by adding the activity of other cytotoxic drugs or ,  more recently ,  by favorably modulating the effects of 5-FU itself .
Although enhanced activity by such methods has occasionally been suggested in pilot studies or in phase 2 trials ,  these claims have seldom been substantiated by the essential definitive study-a randomized comparison with 5-FU used alone .
The purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate ,  by such a randomized and controlled comparison ,  a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5-FU activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials .
These effects presumably occur through the action of thymidine in blocking oxidative metabolism of 5-FU and increasing 5-FU incorporation into RNA .
Rustum demonstrated in colon 26 tumor and in a transplanted colon tumor in rats that thymidine plus 5-FU produced a significant prolongation of survival time when compared with 5-FU alone .
In the study of Woodcock et al ,  the single colorectal cancer patient treated who was not a prior 5-FU failure had a response of 8 months duration .
Overall therapeutic results were discouraging ,  specifically in colorectal cancer ,  a Mayo Clinic study demonstrated only one response among 30 patients ,  a study of the Baltimore Cancer Research Program showed no responses among 21 patients ,  and a New York Memorial study demonstrated only two minor responses among 19 evaluated patients .
The second study ,  conducted at the University of Wisconsin (Madison) ,  showed that advanced-disease patients treated with combined 5-FU and levamisole lived significantly longer than patients treated with 5-FU alone .
With this background we initiated a randomized controlled comparison of 5-FU alone with 5-FU plus high-dose thymidine ,  5-FU plus PALA ,  5-FU plus levamisole ,  and MOF-Strept .
We elected to use survival as our primary endpoint in patients with both measurable and nonmeasurable disease and also to evaluate objective response rates among those patients with measurable disease .
Contraindications to selection included a WBC count < 4.000/mm or a platelet count < 130.000/mm. a serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL. complete disability (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group IECOG] performance score 4). recent major surgery (exploration and biopsy only. < 14 days ,  resection or bypass surgery ,  < 21 days) ,  an uncontrolled infectious process. frequent vomiting or severe anorexia ,  any previous chemotherapy ,  and intensive radiation to the axial skeleton within the preceding 4 weeks .
Patients were then randomized to treatment with 5-FU alone ,  5-FU plus PALA. 5-FU plus thymidine. 5-FU plus levamisole ,  or MOFStrept .
5-FU alone. 5-FU was administered in undiluted form by rapid intravenous (IV) injection at a dose of 500 mg/m2 daily for 5 consecutive days .
Two hours following initiation of the thymidine infusion. 5-FU was administered by rapid IV injection in a single dose of 300 mg/m' .
The single doses of thymidine and 5-FU were repeated at 4-week intervals. 5-FUplus PALA. 5-FU was administered by rapid IV injection at a dosage of 300 mg/m2 for 5 consecutive days .
Courses of therapy were repeated every 5 weeks. 5-FU plus levamisole. 5-FU was administered in undiluted form by rapid IV injection at a dose of 500 mg/m 2/d for 5 consecutive days .
MOF-Strept. 5-FU was administered in undiluted form by rapid IV injection at a dose of 300 mg/m 2/d on days I through 5 and 36 through 40 .
For the 5-FU plus thymidine regimen ,  patients were evaluated every 4 weeks ,  while for all other regimens ,  this evaluation occurred every 5 weeks .
Standard criteria for declaring objective response were used. ie. a 5017 or greater reduction in the product of longest perpendicular diameters of bidimensionally measurable lesions or a 30% or greater decrease in the sum of liver measurements below the xyphoid process at costal margin .
The log rank statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with equality of survival curves ,  while the Cox partial likelihood score statistic was used to assess consistency of the data with the hypothesis that any one of the combinations would yield at least a 50% improvement in survival over 5-FU alone .
Four patients were lost to analysis due to ineligibility or cancellation on the 5-FU alone arm ,  four patients on 5-FU plus PALA ,  two patients on 5-FU plus thymidine ,  two patients on MOF-Strept ,  and none on 5-FU plus levamisole .
MOF-Strept was characterized by substantially more frequent and more severe nausea and vomiting ,  and this was the only regimen characterized by a substantive incidence of thrombocytopenia. 5-FU plus PALA had substantially more frequent mucocutaneous reactions and somewhat more frequent diarrhea ,  but less hematologic toxicity than 5-FU alone or any of the other regimens .
On the other hand ,  5-FU plus thymidine had a reduced incidence of mucocutaneous reactions and of diarrhea with comparable hematologic toxicity when compared with 5-FU alone .
These reactions were primarily headache (seven patients) ,  lethargy (four patients) ,  dizziness with ataxia (four patients) ,  and occasional confusion (two patients) .
There were three treatment-related deaths ,  one each on 5-FU alone ,  5-FU plus thymidine ,  and MOF-Strept .
It is noteworthy that while the MOF-Strept regimen had the highest regression rate ,  it was also the regimen with the lowest proportion of patients whose disease remained stable and the highest proportion of patients in whom the best response observed was tumor regression .
There was no suggestion that any of the combination regimens performed in a superior fashion to 5-FU used alone ,  and it is unlikely that any could produce as much as a 50% increase in time to progression (P < .05) for each regimen v 5-FU alone .
This was confirmed by a stratified Cox analysis ,  adjusting for key prognostic covariates ,  which indicated that the data were inconsistent with any combination regimen yielding a 50% increase in survival relative to 5-FU (ie ,  a hazard ratio of 1 .5) ,  wherefore 5-FU plus PALA ,  P < .01 ,  5-FU plus thymidine ,  P < .0001 ,  5-FU plus levamisole ,  P < .01 ,  and MOF-Strept ,  P < .05 .
In spite of the fact that the patients tested were in very good overall general condition with no previous chemotherapy exposure ,  none of our experimental regimens produced any meaningful advantage over therapy with simple 5-FU alone and none can be recommended for standard practice .
Martin has pointed out that it might be possible to obtain the full biochemical modulating effect of PALA by using a considerably lower dose of this agent ,  thereby allowing the 5-FU dose to be increased to near full therapeutic levels .
The total dose of 5-FU in this combination was only 12% of the dosage of 5-FU used alone that would produce a comparable degree of hematologic toxicity .
