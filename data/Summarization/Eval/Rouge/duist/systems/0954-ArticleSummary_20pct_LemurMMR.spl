in the various analyses we studied the following end points any relapse of breast cancer or death without a known relapse of breast cancer for the analysis of disease free survival locoregional recurrence as a first event before a systemic recurrence in the ipsilateral chest wall or an axillary internal mammary or supraclavicular node for the analysis of survival free of locoregional disease any systemic relapse with or without a locoregional relapse or death without a known systemic relapse for the analysis of survival free of systemic disease death from breast cancer for the analysis of breast cancer specific survival and any death for the analysis of overall survival 
trials of postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer conducted during the 1960s and 1970s showed significant reductions in rates of locoregional recurrence but no improvement in overall survival 
this study of premenopausal women with breast cancer demonstrates that locoregional radiotherapy reduces the rates of locoregional and systemic relapses and the chance of dying from breast cancer 
the surgery was performed by specialists who referred all the patients to the british columbia cancer agency the provincial cancer institute for registration randomization and the planning of the chemotherapy and radiation treatments 
nevertheless there are reasons to reconsider radiotherapy including the limited value of adjuvant chemotherapy for bulky disease a synergistic effect of chemotherapy plus radiation on residual locoregional tumor and the possibility that eliminating bulky disease with radiation may improve the effect of chemotherapy because chemotherapy may be more effective when the overall disease burden is low 
in the survival analysis the time to the end points associated with each event was calculated from the date of the tissue diagnosis of breast cancer 
the meta analysis performed by the early breast cancer trialists collaborative group 1 which analyzed all the randomized radiation trials begun before 1985 found a 67 percent reduction in rates of locoregional relapse p 0 001 and a 6 percent reduction in mortality from breast cancer p 0 03 but no improvement in overall survival 
the chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide 600 mg per square meter of body surface area methotrexate 40 mg per square meter and fluorouracil 600 mg per square meter the cmf regimen given intravenously every 21 days as described by bonadonna et al initially for 12 months 80 patients and in the case of patients randomized after 1981 for 6 months 
among the 94 patients who had systemic relapses after chemotherapy alone 19 were alive at the time of the 15 year analysis as compared with 9 of the 75 patients with such relapses in the chemotherapy radiotherapy group 
these values translate into an overall reduction of 33 percent in the rate of recurrence of breast cancer relative risk 0 67 95 percent confidence interval 0 50 to 0 90 p 0 007 with an improvement of 17 percentage points in disease free survival at the 15 year followup fig 1 
mortality from breast cancer was reduced by 29 percent in the chemotherapy radiotherapy group relative risk 0 71 95 percent confidence interval 0 51 to 0 99 p 0 05 with 62 deaths as compared with 76 in the chemotherapy only group which represented an improvement of 10 percentage points in breast cancer specific survival fig 3 
the rate of locoregional recurrence was reduced by 56 percent relative risk 0 44 95 percent confidence interval 0 26 to 0 77 p 0 003 in the group given chemotherapy plus radiotherapy 19 events vs 36 events in the group treated with chemotherapy only for an absolute improvement of 20 percent in survival free of local disease 
our trial did not stratify the patients according to nodal status but a test for interaction showed no significant difference in the magnitude of the benefit from radiotherapy between the subgroup with three or fewer positive nodes and the subgroup with four or more positive nodes 
also in various past trials different areas were encompassed in the irradiated volume and the trials differed in techniques of radiation treatment planning age nodal status and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy 
there was an overall reduction of 34 percent in the rate of systemic recurrence relative risk 0 66 95 percent confidence interval 0 49 to 0 89 p 0 006 in the group treated with combined therapy 75 of 164 patients vs 94 of 154 patients in the group treated only with chemotherapy and a 17 percentage point improvement in systemic disease free survival fig 2 
the other eight studies were notsimilar to ours or the danish trial either because the number of randomized premenopausal patients was small or because the radiotherapy techniques or the chemotherapy schedules were heterogeneous 
of these only the danish study found that radiotherapy had a benefit of a magnitude similar to that in our trial and there was a significant survival benefit in favor of radiotherapy p 0 001 
four randomized trials comparing breast irradiation with no irradiation in patients who underwent conservative surgery showed significant reductions in the rate of relapse in the breast but no effect on systemic recurrences or overall survival 
after written informed consent was obtained the patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy plus locoregional radiotherapy in five fields the chemotherapy radiotherapy group with 164 patients and those receiving chemotherapy alone the chemotherapy group with 154 patients
