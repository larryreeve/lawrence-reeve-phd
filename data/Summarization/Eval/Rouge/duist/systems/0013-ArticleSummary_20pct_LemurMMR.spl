although many patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix are cured with local measures a substantial minority recur or present with metastases and are potential candidates for systemic therapy 
although we are not aware of such complications in the present trial the possible risk of secondary malignancies plus the failure to show an improvement in outcome for c m would suggest a limited future for mitolactol in the treatment of cervix cancer 
the results of this trial in cervix cancer reflect a common set of findings in combination chemotherapy of advanced solid tumors namely a higher response rate but not a high cr rate with a combination compared with single agent therapy at the cost of more toxicity and no survival benefit 
it appears that studies are limited to a comparison of doxorubicin with or without vincristine and doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide n 174 with no difference in response rate pfi or survival a comparison of cisplatin dose schedules already referred to a study of cisplatin infusion time n 331 and a comparison of carboplatin versus iproplatin n 361 with no difference in response rate pfi or survival 
therefore the primary objective of this study was to compare the proportion of patients who responded to the cisplatin only regimen versus each of the combination regimens 
eligible patients included women with histologically confirmed advanced stage ivb recurrent or persistent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix not suitable for curative treatment with surgery and or radiotherapy 
ineligible patients included those with cervical neoplasms other than squamous cell carcinoma or with nonmeasurable cervical cancer wbc count less than 4 000 ul and or platelet count less than 100 000 ul abnormal liver function bilirubin ast or alkaline phosphatase level two times normal not related to the cancer bilateral hydronephrosis gog ps 3 or 4 past or concomitant malignancy other than skin excluding melanoma prior therapy with cytotoxic drugs except when used as a radiation sensitizer radiationtherapy within 3 weeks of entry lesions measurable only by ultrasound or pregnancy or lactation 
although an intermediate dose level 50 mg m cisplatin and 225mg m mitolactol daily for 5 days was considered it wasnot pursued since six of 10 patients at the first dose level in the pilot study required dose reductions and or delays with re treatment 
treatment of cervix cancer with the combination of ifosfamide cisplatin and bleomycin yielded a 69 response rate 49 patients in one series 
the pilot study on which the c m arm of the present trial was based identified 180 mg m for 5 days as the maximum tolerated dose in combination with cisplatin 
they are also included in the analysis of overall survival and pfs but are not included in the summary of toxicity 
since the role of bleomycin in cervix cancer is unclear but implies restricting therapy to patients with good pulmonary function we elected not to include bleomycinin the present study 
patients were prospectively stratified according to whether they had received prior radiation sensitizer treatment hydroxyurea cisplatin or fluorouracil and by ps and were then centrally randomized with equal probability to receive 1 cisplatin 50 mg m with appropriate hydration every 3 weeks for a maximum of six courses or 2 cisplatin 50 mg m on day 1 plus mitolactol 180 mg m orally for 5 days on days 2 through 6 every 3 weeks or 3 cisplatin 50mg m plus ifosfamide 5 0 g m over 24 hours plus mesna 6 g m given concurrently with ifosfamide and for 12 hours after every 3 weeks again for a maximum of six courses 
the use of lorazepam was discouraged in such patients in order not to mask the possible neurotoxicity of ifosfamide 
the design for this study was based on the assumption that a 15 increase in the response rate due to the addition of either mitolactolor ifosfamide to cisplatin would be regarded as clinically meaningful 
the result was impressive but the importance of bleomycin was unclear and its toxicity sometimes troublesome so we proposed to compare cisplatin alone versus a regimen of cisplatinplus mitolactol c m and a regimen of cisplatin plusifosfamide and mesna cifx 
the null hypothesis was rejected if the probability of the observed result or a more extreme result under the null hypothesis was less than 0 025 one tail test a linear logistic model was used to adjust for age ps and whether cisplatin had been used as a radiosensitizer 
cisplatin is said to be the most active anticancer drug in cervical cancer although 100 mg m did not significantly improve the complete response cr rate compared prospectively with 50 mg m 12 7 v 10 respectively and there was no appreciable difference in response duration progression free interval pfi or survival thus there is no convincing reason to use a cisplatindose higher than 50 mg m 
in the present trial there was a significant improvement in pfs associated with cifx however its impact on the patient s sense of well being was not assessed 
in fact this appears to be the first evidence of an impact of a chemotherapy regimen on pfs in advanced cervix cancer 
a phase ii study of the gynecologic oncology group gog demonstrated activity formitolactol as a single agent in cervical cancer using 180mg m d for 10 days by mouth in repeated 4 week cycles there were 55 assessable patients with one cr and 15 partial responses prs 29 response rate 
cisplatin alone has limited value in advanced cervix cancer we are not aware of a randomized trial of cisplatin versus supportive care
