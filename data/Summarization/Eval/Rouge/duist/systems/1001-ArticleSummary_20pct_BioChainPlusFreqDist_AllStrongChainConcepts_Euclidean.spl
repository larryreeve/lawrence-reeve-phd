Purpose ,  As previously shown ,  antibody treatment increased survival of patients with resected colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C .
Conclusion ,  The now-matured study shows that 17-1A antibody administered after surgery prevents the development of distant metastasis in approximately one third of patients .
Patient Selection and Surgery .
Stratification and Randomization .
The study performance and protocol adherence was overseen by the trial's blometncal center located at the University of Essen .
The presented 7-year follow-up data may therefore be considered mature and final .
A final status of 185 patients could be obtained for this analysis .
The main cause of ineligibihty (12 cases) was erroneous staging .
Survival .
After 7 years ,  a total of 87 deaths were observed in 166 eligible patients .
The death rate of the observed group was 63% (48 of 76 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  48 to 78) of patients and that of the treated group was 43% (39 of 90 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  31 to 58) .
The calculated recurrence rate was 68% (49 of 76 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  53 to 82) m the control group and 52% (47 of 90 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  39 to 67) in the 17-1A group .
Antibody treatment increased time to recurrence (P = .04 with Cox proportional hazards model corrected for influence of prognostic variables ,  and P = .07 with log-rank test for umvanate analysis) .
Therefore ,  the proposition is holding up that treatment with 17-1A may preferentially act on isolated tumor cells and thus prevent outgrowth of distant metastases .
As shown in Table 2 ,  there is an excess of local recurrences in the treatment group ,  which may partially be explained by the longer survival of treated patients .
Toxicity .
There were no late treatment-related fatalities or life-threatening conditions ,  or any evidence for chronic drug-related side effects .
The kinetics of the HAMA response in the two subgroups have been described in the 5-year report .
DISCUSSION .
Since these forms of therapy were administered only to the control group ,  a bias may have been introduced that influenced the outcome against the antibody treatment ,  which explains the apparent difference seen m the local recurrence rate (Table 2) .
These findings were confirmed by another cooperative group .
This finding lends some support to the concept of long-lasting dormancy in early disseminated tumor cells .
The dose of antibody chosen deserves a special comment .
This strategy ,  originally pro1 7 posed by Sears et al ,  was only partially successful ,  as only about 20% of the recipients did not respond to mouse immunoglobulin ,  while the others exhibited a distinct ,  albeit slow rise of HAMA titers .
Nevertheless ,  the high dose may have been critical to obtain a steep transvascular concentration gradient required for tissue penetration .
Similar high doses were used in the lymphoma trial cited earlier .
Why only one third of the patients at risk have responded to the antibody treatment may be explained by variations in accessibility ,  vulnerability ,  and/or antigen expression in individual disseminated tumor cells .
Therefore ,  in anticipation of antigenic heterogeneity ,  a combination therapy that consists of antibodies of different specificities may forestall a selection of antigen-negative cells exerted inevitably by a one-antibody approach .
On the other hand ,  the peculiar immunogenicity of the murine antibody may be important for the recruitment of human T cells as mediators of an indirect antitumor effect .
These reactions are best explained by cytotoxic effects of the antibody on normal epithelial cells that bear the 17-1A antigen to a similar degree as tumor cells .
In conclusion ,  the presented results still support the original hypothesis that minimal residual disease occurring so frequently in patients with sohd tumors appears to be an indication for antibody therapy .
