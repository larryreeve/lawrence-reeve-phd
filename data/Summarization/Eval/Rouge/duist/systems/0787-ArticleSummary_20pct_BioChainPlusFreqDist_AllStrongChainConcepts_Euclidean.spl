Little change has been seen in survival rates ,  which remain at about 40% at 5 years from diagnosis .
The aim was to increase the number of patients in whom curative resection could be done ,  and so improve survival rates .
The dose of radiation (40 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks) was chosen as the highest that was deemed safe before anterior resection with the wide-field technique proposed .
We present the results of this trial with a minimum follow-up time for surviving patients of 5 years .
Two parallel opposed fields 18 cm by 15 cm were positioned to cover the tumour with an adequate proximal margin (normally 5 cm). 20 daily fractions of 2 Gy at the mid-plane central axis of the volume of the tumour were given over 4 weeks .
Criteria for suspicion of local recurrence were pain ,  increasing in severity and requiring medication ,  or disturbance of bladder function ,  induration in the perineum or pelvis on examination ,  or palpation of a mass in the pelvis or at the anastomosis .
For the analyses the date of first local recurrence was taken as the date of the first new clinical or histological evidence of local recurrence ,  we included an assessment of clinical evidence of local recurrence at death .
We intended to enrol 450 patients (with the anticipation of 251 deaths) ,  this sample size would have provided 90% power to detect a 15% increase in the 3-year survival rate (from 35% to 50%) ,  which was thought plausible at the time the trial was designed .
Based on accrual to the previous MRC preoperative radiotherapy trial ,  we expected that this number would be accrued in 4 to 5 years .
Proportions were compared by the  2 test ,  and ordered categorical data by the Mann-Whitney test .
Results .
The presence of residual disease in the pelvis ,  abdomen ,  or both ,  was assessed .
However ,  the number of lymph nodes examined was lower in the radiotherapy group .
The log-rank comparison suggests an advantage for the radiotherapy group of borderline statistical significance (p=0¡¤04) .
Consistent with the results of the individual endpoints ,  results for disease-free survival also suggest a benefit to the radiotherapy patients (hazard ratio 0.76 [0.58-1.0] ,  log-rank p=0.05) .
This estimate indicates a substantial decrease in the risk of death from colorectal cancer in patients allocated radiotherapy ,  although the data are compatible with a halving of the risk of death from colorectal cancer at one extreme or as little as 3% reduction in risk at the other .
Discussion .
Failure to recruit the planned number of patients is reflected in the wide 95% CI seen for each of the main endpoints .
There was a suggestion that the risk of death from colorectal cancer was reduced ,  and a trend towards an improvement in overall survival .
However ,  the trial was of sufficient size to detect only substantial improvement in overall survival .
In the earlier trial surgeons were asked only to record their preoperative findings with respect to fixity ,  but in this trial they were asked to base a crucial decision on type of treatment on these observations .
The case for preoperative adjuvant radiotherapy has been supported by several trials published since this trial started ,  including the European trial reported by Gerard and colleagues .
None of these studies has concentrated specifically on locally advanced tumours .
Moreover ,  current practice is to give a short course of high-dose radiation (25 Gy over 5.7 days) and to proceed to immediate surgery ,  thus avoiding the long delay before surgery .
