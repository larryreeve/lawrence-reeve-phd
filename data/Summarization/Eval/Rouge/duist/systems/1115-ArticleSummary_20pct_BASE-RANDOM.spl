INTRODUCTION .
An analysis of the patterns of failure after radiation therapy in locally advanced cervical cancer reveals that of those who recur over 70% have some component of pelvic failure as the first site of relapse and two-thirds develop some component of distant disease .
Theoretical disadvantages of concurrent administration include increased acute toxicity which might limit or delay the delivery of definitive irradiation or increased late toxicity particularly if the drugs and radiation do not exhibit ‘‘toxicity’’ independence .
Interest in infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with or without other agents such as mitomycin C and cisplatin ,  developed from both laboratory data suggesting enhanced tumor cell kill over radiation alone and clinical data .
The success of concurrent regimens with these agents in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of other sites such as the anal canal and esophagus suggested that similar regimens were worthy of exploration in carcinomas of the cervix .
The optimal dosing schedule for maximizing cell kill with infusional 5-FU and radiation remains undefined ,  but laboratory data suggested greater effects with increasing dose and prolonged exposure to 5-FU and when drug was present for intervals in excess of 48 h after radiation .
Stratum 2 included those with FIGO stage IIB disease with any lateral parametrial involvement or stage IIIB with involvement of one pelvic sidewall .
Patients were randomized to receive either (a) standard external beam pelvic irradiation (EBRT) in a dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions defined at 100% versus ,  (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional intravenous 5-FU in a dose of 1 g/m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  (c) partially hyperfractionated RT ,  5280 cGy in 33 fractions ,  2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of RT ,  or (d) arm (c) with the same infusional 5-FU .
Patients were treated prone preferably using a four-field box technique ,  or a parallel pair .
It was loaded to extend at least 2 cm above the clinically identified superior extent of disease and inferiorly to 1 cm below the cervix or 1 cm below the lowest extent of vaginal disease identified after external therapy .
If a weekend break was necessary ,  the infusion was only given on radiotherapy treatment days .
The reduced fraction size in arms (c) and (d) was designed to attempt to take advantage of knowledge of the affect of fraction size on late complications and to determine whether complication rates were decreased by using decreased fraction size .
Where information was missing for some parameters ,  single models were fitted for these parameters .
Severe late or chronic bowel symptoms were those of fistula ,  perforation ,  stricture ,  or obstruction requiring hospitalization or surgery and bleeding requiring transfusion .
Severe bladder symptoms were any condition requiring surgery ,  e.g. ,  fistula ,  or hematuria requiring transfusion .
The median age of the patients was 48 years with a range of 23 to 85 years .
For strata 1 and 2 the distribution of FIGO stage ,  tumor size ,  nodal involvement on lymphography ,  tumor grade ,  and capillary lymphatic space involvement (CLS) for each treatment are shown in Tables 1 and 2 .
Ninety-nine patients were in stratum 1 ,  of which 46 were stage IB/IIA and 53 were stage IIB .
In view of the small number of patients in stratum 3 ,  a detailed breakdown of possible tumor prognostic factors is not shown .
The median duration of follow-up for the whole population is 59 months (95% confidence interval ,  57 to 66 months) .
One hundred and ninety of 221 patients received external beam radiation using the box technique ,  while 31 were treated with a parallel pair .
Compliance with the planned radiation schedules was good .
Tumor was grade 1 in 8 of 221 (4%) ,  grade 2 in 106 of 221 (48%) ,  and grade 3 in 75 of the 221 (34%) .
Capillary lymphatic space (CLS) involvement was commented on in 146 of 221 (66%) .
Twelve patients are lost to follow-up ,  6 with a duration of less than 2 years ,  4 with less than 3 years ,  and 2 with less than 5 years .
The 5-year Kaplan–Meier disease-free survival for those irradiated without 5-FU was 48% versus 71% for those who received 5-FU (log rank P 5 0.02) (Fig. 6) .
However ,  in evaluating the importance of the contribution of the change in fractionation to the differences observed ,  there was no significant difference in the 5-year survival of those treated on standard radiation versus those treated with hyperfractionated irradiation whether or not 5-FU was used .
The 5-year Kaplan–Meier survival was 62% for those treated with hyperfractionated irradiation and was not significantly different from the 58% survival of those treated with standard irradiation .
The observed differences in pelvic control and survival in favor of the standard radiation and concurrent 5-FU associated with the addition of 5-FU rather than the change in radiation schedule .
There appears to be no imbalance in the distribution by FIGO stage ,  cell type or CLS involvement .
Eight occurred in those receiving standard radiation and five in those receiving altered RT .
Serious complications resolved (obstruction resolved or colostomy closed) in all but four of the patients .
Given the low incidence of late complications it is not possible to establish an actuarial probability of risk with these regimens .
DISCUSSION .
Within stratum 2 there was an improvement in pelvic control with the use of 5-FU but the difference was not statistically significant .
The direction of benefit in favor of 5-FU with standard radiation compared to the other treatments was the same in strata 1 and 2 .
The tumor- and patient-related factors examined were FIGO stage (IB versus IIA versus IIB) ,  size of tumor (greater or less than 6 cm and greater or less than 7 cm) ,  grade of tumor the presence or absence of capillary-like space involvement ,  nodal involvement ,  and patient age as a continuous variable .
The treatment related factors examined were the use of intracavitary radiation ,  the use of 5-FU ,  and the fractionation scheme ,  standard versus partially hyperfractionated .
The only significant factor predicting for disease-free survival was the use of 5-FU .
Such a benefit was not observed in this study .
From the subset analysis of this trial we have generated the hypothesis that there may be a beneficial effect of adding concurrent infusional 5-FU to standard in patients with the disease characteristics of stratum 1 .
The results of these additional studies will be influential in confirming whether the strategy of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation is beneficial for patients with advanced cervical cancer .
