Purpose .
Adjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma is controversial because previous trials reported conflicting results .
The present study was designed with restricted selection criteria and high dose-intensities of the two most active chemotherapeutic agents .
Patients and Methods .
Patients between 18 and 65 years of age with grade 3 to 4 spindle-cell sarcomas (primary diameter >= 5 cm or any size recurrent tumor) in extremities or girdles were eligible .
Stratification was by primary versus recurrent tumors and by tumor diameter greater than or equal to 10 cm versus less than 10 cm. One hundred four patients were randomized ,  51 to the control group and 53 to the treatment group (five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin 60 mg/m2 days 1 and 2 and ifosfamide 1.8 g/m2 days 1 through 5 ,  with hydration ,  mesna ,  and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) .
Results .
The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 48 months in the treatment group and 16 months in the control group (P = .04) ,  and the median overall survival (OS) was 75 months for treated and 46 months for untreated patients (P = .03) .
Therefore ,  our data favor an intensified treatment in similar cases .
The treatment of limb sarcomas mainly relies on a combined-modality approach ,  after the demonstration that pre-or postoperative radiation and conservative surgery led to local control in a high proportion of patients.4 In fact ,  limb-sparing procedures allow an 85% to 90% local dis-ease-free survival (DFS) rate and demolitive surgery now represents only 5% to 10% of the operations in comparison with the 50% survival rate of the 1960s to 1970s .
In the early 1960s ,  this clinical behaviour prompted the introduction of adjuvant chemotherapy trials with the aim of increasing DFS and possibly overall survival (OS) .
The main findings were statistical evidence in favor of chemotherapy for local ,  metastasis ,  and overall DFS (P = .016 ,  .0003 ,  and .0001 ,  respectively) and a trend towards increased OS (P = .12) .
After a positive biopsy for sarcoma ,  all patients underwent complete staging and programmed local treatment .
Treatment started after the completion of any local treatment and/or as soon as the wound had healed (Fig 1) .
Inclusion criteria were as follows ,  age ,  18 to 65 years ,  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2 ,  primary tumors subfascially localized with diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm ,  high-grade spindle-cell or polymorphous sarcomas (fibrosarcoma ,  malignant fibrous histiocytoma ,  polymorphous liposarcoma ,  leiomyosarcoma ,  synovial sarcoma ,  malignant schwannoma ,  angiosarcoma ,  and polymorphous rhabdomyosarcoma) ,  local relapse of any size ,  no previous radio/chemotherapy ,  adequate bone marrow (WBC count of >= 4,000/fiL ,  platelets = 120.000/mL ,  and hemoglobin >= 10 g/dL) ,  renal (creatinine <= 1.3 mg/dL) ,  hepatic (SGOT <= 2.5 X normal value and bilirubin <= 1.2 mg/dL) ,  and pulmonary functions .
Local Treatment .
Adjuvant Treatment .
Chemotherapy ,  repeated every 3 weeks ,  consisted of five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin (EPI) 60 mg/m2/die ,  in a short intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1 and 2 (total dose per cycle ,  120 mg/m2) ,  IFO 1.8 g/m2/die diluted in 500 mL of normal saline and administered over 1 hour on days 1 through 5 (total dose per cycle ,  9 g/m2) ,  and 6-mercapto-ethansulfonate in a bolus IV injection at 20% of the IFO dose ,  given before and 4 and 8 hours after the IFO infusions .
In the case of incomplete hematologic recovery (defined as WBC < 4,000/mL and platelets [PLTS] < 100.000/mL) ,  treatment was postponed by one or more weeks ,  furthermore ,  on complete hematologic recovery ,  a dose reduction of EPI was applied depending on the observed nadirs (WBC > 1,000/mL and PLTS > 75.000/mL ,  IFO and EPI doses both 100% ,  WBC > 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL ,  IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 75% ,  WBC < 500/mL and PLTS < 50.000/mL ,  IFO dose 100% and EPI dose 50%) .
Overall DFS was defined as the time between randomization and the first recurrence ,  and OS was defined as the time between randomization and death as a result of disease (patients dying in complete remission were considered as censored on the date of death for OS) .
However ,  the median diameter is the same in the two groups ,  and the difference in range is caused by a small number (three patients) of large tumors in the control group .
Local Treatment .
Seven patients (13%) did not start adjuvant treatment .
The median time between surgery and the start of chemotherapy was 62 days (range ,  8 to 187 days) ,  in the three cases with early metastases ,  the time intervals between surgery and relapse were 42 ,  74 ,  and 89 days .
Of the 46 patients that started chemotherapy ,  four did not complete the treatment .
One patient refused the fifth and last cycle for personal reasons ,  and three patients did not complete the treatment because of related toxicities (reappearance of viral uveitis ,  consecutive episodes of pneumonitis ,  and persistent leukopenia) after two ,  three ,  and four cycles ,  respectively .
The mean administered doses of the fifth cycle (94 mg of EPI and 8,156 mg of IFO) were slightly lower than those of the fourth cycle (95.5 mg of EPI and 8,257 mg of IFO) .
The average median relative dose-intensity (DI) of the program was 83.3% (Table 2) ,  63% of the cycles were given at a DI of >= 80% and 48% at a DI of >= 90% .
At the time of statistical analysis (November 1999) ,  the median follow-up for the 104 patients included in the study was 59 months ,  61 months in the treatment arm and 55 months in the control arm .
Univariate analyses did not reveal any statistically significant difference in overall DFS and OS for any of the characteristics considered (age ,  sex ,  center of surgery ,  histology ,  grading ,  site of primary tumor ,  presentation ,  diameter ,  local treatment ,  and stratification) with the exception of adjuvant treatment (data not shown) .
Overall DFS .
The median overall DFS was 48 months among treated patients and 16 months in the control group .
Taking into account the overall local relapse rate (all local events observed) ,  11 patients in the control group and nine in the treatment group experienced local failure .
Adjuvant treatment of localized soft tissue sarcomas is controversial because no sufficient and convincing data are available .
The preliminary data of previous studies were sometimes positive for DFS and OS , 15-19 but further analyses ,  made after an adequate follow-up time ,  indicated a disappearance of the positive effect of chemotherapy on 20,21 and ,  in some cases ,  worse results.22 However ,  the recently published meta-analysis , 7 involving 1,568 patients ,  showed a statistically significant benefit for treated patients of 6% ,  10% ,  and 10% for local ,  metastatic ,  and overall DFS ,  respectively ,  and a favorable (but not statistically significant) trend in OS (4%) ,  after a median of 9.4 years of follow-up .
It is directly derived from consecutive phase I-II dose-intensification trials carried out at the Centro di Riferimento Oncologico of Aviano.27,31 The epirubicin dose level of 60 mg/m2 X 2 days represents the step before the maximum-tolerated dose established in those trials (70 mg/m2 epirubicin X 2 days) when given in combination with fixed full doses of ifosfamide (1.8 g/m2/d X 5 days) in advanced cases of soft tissue sarcoma .
The outcome results at 4 years revealed a 23% overall local relapse ,  with a trend in favor of the treatment group .
In fact ,  the median diameter of the primary tumors and relapses was 10 and 9 cm ,  respectively ,  with no differences between treatment and control groups (Table 1) .
Adjuvant treatment of soft tissue sarcomas is still strongly debated35,36 ,  despite 14 published trials and one meta-analysis performed on 1,568 randomized patients .
