Surgical stress ,  anaesthetics and other drugs ,  hypercoagulability ,  blood transfusions ,  and surgery-induced impairment of immune function are all reasons why the perioperative period is considered a vulnerable phase in which tumour progression is likely .
Patients were randomly assigned no adjuvant treatment (control group) or an immediate postoperative intraportal infusion of 500mg/m fluorouracil plus 5000 units heparin in 1 L 5% glucose per 24 h for 7 consecutive days (days 1-7) plus 10 mg/m mitomycin in a single dose on day 1 .
Postoperatively ,  blood counts and liver function tests were done on days 1 ,  3 ,  5 ,  7 ,  10 ,  14 ,  28 ,  and 42.Resected tissue was examined by histology and classified (Dukes' classification ,  Astler-Coller modification) .
Subgroup analyses for site of first relapse were carried out with stratification for treatment group ,  node status ,  and localisation of the tumour (colon vs rectum) .
The group assigned perioperative portal chemotherapy had significantly higher 5-year disease-free survival than the control group (table 2) .
There were only 2 cases of thrombocytopenia (56 and 71 X 10/L) in the infusion group ,  but the mean platelet count was significantly lower on day 28 than that in the control group .
This trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase survival in patients with colorectal cancer .
However ,  none of the studies couldc onfirm the statistically significant overall effect on the frequency of liver metastases  reported by Taylor et al. It seems likely that the effect of adjuvant portal chemotherapy on overall and disease-free survival can be attributed to the systemic effects of intraportal fluorouracil ,  which lead to a reduction in all tumour relapses (ie ,  local recurrences ,  liver metastases ,  and other distant metastases) .
Our randomised three-arm study (control vs portal vs systemic adjuvant therapy) was carried out between 1987 and 1993 in 770 patients .
The median observation time will soon reach 5 years and the first survival analysis will be undertaken .
