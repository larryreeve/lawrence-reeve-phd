The optimal treatment of large stage IB cervical cancer has been a source of controversy since the late 1960s .
METHODS .
All patients were required to have a Gynecologic Oncology Group performance status of 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  or 3 (equivalent to Karnofsky performance scores of 90 or 100 ,  70 or 80 ,  50 or 60 ,  and 30 or 40 ,  respectively) and adequate bone marrow ,  renal function ,  and hepatic function .
Cisplatin was given intravenously once a week at a dose of 40 mg per square meter of body-surface area ,  with the total dose not to exceed 70 mg per week .
The final dose could be given during a patient’s hospitalization for intracavitary brachytherapy .
Treatment with cisplatin was withheld if the total white-cell count fell below 3000 per cubic millimeter or if creatinine clearance fell below 50 ml per minute .
Extrafascial hysterectomy was performed three to six weeks after the completion of radiotherapy .
The Radiological Physics Center in Houston coordinated the reviews of radiotherapy .
Adverse effects were reported in accordance with the Gynecologic Oncology Group criteria .
The hysterectomy specimens were evaluated for evidence of cancer .
We estimated that 173 patients were needed in each treatment group in order to be able to detect a 40 percent decrease in the recurrence rate in the group given radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
To simplify presentation ,  the P values were not adjusted for the results of the two interim analyses .
Four were subsequently excluded after a central review by the pathology committee found that the specimen was inadequate for evaluation in the case of one patient , the primary lesion had been misidentified in the case of one patient ,  the cell type had been misidentified in the case of one patient ,  and the stage of the tumor had been overestimated in the case of one patient .
An additional patient was also excluded because she had received radiotherapy before entry .
Four patients assigned to the cisplatin regimen (2 percent) received no cisplatin .
Extrafascial hysterectomy was performed after radiotherapy in 168 patients (90 percent) in the group given radiotherapy alone and 175 patients (96 percent) in the group given radiotherapy and cisplatin .
There were significantly more hysterectomy specimens without detectable cancer in the combined-therapy group than in the group given radiotherapy alone (52 percent vs. 41 percent ,  P=0.04) .
At the time of this analysis ,  the rate of progression-free survival was significantly higher among patients in the combined-therapy group (P<0.001 by the log-rank test) (Fig. 1) .
One patient who received cisplatin died after an automobile accident ,  she had no evidence of cancer at her last examination .
The relative risk of death in the combined-therapy group as compared with the group given radiotherapy alone was 0.54 (95 percent confidence interval ,  0.34 to 0.86) .
The threeyear survival rates were 74 percent in the group given radiotherapy alone and 83 percent in the combined-therapy group (P=0.008 by the log-rank test) (Fig. 2) .
This approach was ,  however ,  associated with considerable morbidity .
This controversy stimulated an earlier Gynecologic Oncology Group trial in which patients were randomly assigned to undergo either hysterectomy after radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone (unpublished data) .
All our patients had cervical cancers of at least 4 cm in diameter ,  and the distribution of the tumors according to size was similar in the two treatment groups .
Cisplatin potentiates the sublethal damageinduced by radiation and inhibits the repair of potentially lethal radiation-induced damage .
The promising results of these studies as well as the fact that this combination is well tolerated and easy to administer on an outpatient basis led us to evaluate it in this trial .
The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group study ,  whose results appear elsewhere in this issue of the Journal ,  compared pelvic and para-aortic radiotherapy with pelvic radiotherapy in  combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil in patients with clinical stage IB through IVA cervical cancer .
It is reasonable to conclude on the basis of these results and our results that the elimination of hysterectomy from both regimens would not have affected the increase in survival associated with the use of cisplatin .
