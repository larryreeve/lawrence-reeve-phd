INTRODUCTION .
Traditionally ,  women with lymph node metastases have been treated with postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy .
PATIENTS AND METHODS .
In 1993 ,  the sample size goal was increased because of the lower than expected recurrence rate ,  a better estimate of the change in the recurrence rate over time ,  and a small ,  but significant ,  frequency of noncompliance in the radiation therapy (RT) regimen .
All designs allowed for 80% statistical power when performing a one-tail test at the 0.05 level .
Eligibility .
The ureter had to be unroofed from its entry into the broad ligament to its intramural portion in the bladder and dissected laterally from its attachments to the cardinal ligament .
Radiation Therapy .
Patients received external beam irradiation and no brachytherapy .
Follow-up Observation .
Quality Control .
Any disagreement among the reviewing pathologists was resolved by a GOG referee pathologist .
Review of operative reports was conducted to evaluate the completeness of surgical procedures .
Statistical Methods .
The primary outcome variable was recurrence-free interval (RFI) .
Life tables were computed using the method of Kaplan and Meier .
When the characteristic was continuous (e.g. ,  age) the Kruskal–Wallis test was used .
RESULTS .
Between March 1988 and September 1995 ,  299 women were accessioned into the study .
There was a disproportionately larger number of patients with positive CLS among the NFT regimen (24% versus 35%) and more patients with .4 cm diameter tumors in the RT regimen (62% versus 54%) .
The site of recurrence was unknown for 2 patients .
The difference between treatment groups remained statistically significant .
DISCUSSION .
However ,  Roche and Norris questioned the validity of the CLS finding because ,  as they state ,  if enough sections are made ,  most cases might show vascular invasion .
Of the three risk factors ,  depth of invasion seems the most objective and accurate method—a direct measurement on the histological slide .
Furthermore ,  repeat measurements from thesame slide can be taken by the reviewers for the quality control procedures .
Estimating tumor diameter by palpation is more subjective and imprecise than the direct measurement of the depth of invasion .
The evaluation of capillary lymphatic space involvement is also subjective .
Partly due to this lower risk ,  the sample size was increased in August 1993 in order that the statistical power of the trial would be maintained .
A significant number of women with Stage IB cervical cancer should benefit from adjuvant pelvic irradiation because 25% of the lymph-node negative patients have high risk factors according to the 1990 GOG data .
