THE ANTIMETABOLITES methotrexate (MTX) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) have become established over the past quarter century among the most useful cancer chemotherapeutic agents .
MTX has been widely used as a single agent for treatment of head and neck cancer ,  while 5-FU is a major drug for treatment of advanced colorectal and gastric cancer .
The two drugs have been used together clinically on empirical grounds for some time ,  particularly in the treatment of breast cancer ,  but data from experimental tumors in vivo and in vitro document both synergistic and antagonistic interactions .
The sequential exposure of L1210 cells to MTX and then to 5-FU was shown to increase the intracellular concentration of 5-FU ribonucleotides ,  a potential mechanism of synergy .
However ,  synergy is not observed in the presence of physiologic concentrations of purines ,  raising doubts about its clinical relevance .
Sequential administration of moderate doses of MTX followed by 5-FU has been reported effective in advanced head and neck cancer and colorectal cancer ,  as well as breast cancer ,  but the importance of the sequence remains uncertain .
We therefore conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial in which sequential MTX followed by 5-FU was compared to the same drugs given in the opposite order .
Since our primary objective was to compare the treatment sequences ,  we chose to include patients with a variety of tumors reasonably treated with either MTX or 5-FU as single agents .
Our results and those of Browman et al do not support reports of superior efficacy for the sequential administration of MTX followed by 5-FU compared to other drug sequences .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Patients eligible for this study had measurable or evaluable advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck , adenocarcinoma of the colon ,  rectum or stomach ,  or SCC of other primary site (Table I) .
Histopathologic confirmation of diagnosis .
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. leukocyte count >3.0 x 10/L ,  platelet count > 100 x 10/L and adequate renal function (scrum creatinine <90 umol/L or creatinine clearance > 1.0 mL/sec) were required .
The inclusion of some patients with previously untreated stage II head and neck cancer reflected the opinion of the combined head and neck clinic that they were unsuitable for cure by surgery or radiotherapy .
Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the requirements of the institutional ethics committee .
Central telephone randomization used balanced blocks stratified only by primary site to assign one of two treatment sequences ,  either MTX followed one hour later by 5-FU (MF). or 5-FU followed .
SEQUENTIAL MTX/5-FU .
