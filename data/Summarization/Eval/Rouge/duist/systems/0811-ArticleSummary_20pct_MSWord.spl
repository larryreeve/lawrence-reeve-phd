Rustum demonstrated in colon 26 tumor and in a transplanted colon tumor in rats that thymidine plus 5-FU produced a significant prolongation of survival time when compared with 5-FU alone .
In the study of Woodcock et al ,  the single colorectal cancer patient treated who was not a prior 5-FU failure had a response of 8 months duration .
They also observed one additional response among patients who had failed 5-FU .
Overall therapeutic results were discouraging ,  specifically in colorectal cancer: a Mayo Clinic study demonstrated only one response among 30 patients ,  a study of the Baltimore Cancer Research Program showed no responses among 21 patients ,  and a New York Memorial study demonstrated only two minor responses among 19 evaluated patients .
Synergistic activity with the PALA-5-FU combination was demonstrated in murine tumor systems .
The second study ,  conducted at the University of Wisconsin (Madison) ,  showed that advanced-disease patients treated with combined 5-FU and levamisole lived significantly longer than patients treated with 5-FU alone .
In 1981 ,  a New York Memorial study reported a 32% objective response rate among 77 patients treated with MOF-Strept .
We elected to use survival as our primary endpoint in patients with both measurable and nonmeasurable disease and also to evaluate objective response rates among those patients with measurable disease .
METHODS .
Patient Selection .
Patients could be entered with either measurable or nonmeasurable disease .
Patients were then randomized to treatment with 5-FU alone ,  5-FU plus PALA .
5-FU plus thymidine .
5-FU plus levamisole ,  or MOFStrept .
Treatment Methodology.5-FU alone .
5-FU plus thymidine .
5-FU was administered by rapid IV injection in a single dose of 300 mg/m' .
The single doses of thymidine and 5-FU were repeated at 4-week intervals .
5-FUplus PALA .
5-FU was administered by rapid IV injection at a dosage of 300 mg/m2 for 5 consecutive days .
On day I .
5-FU was administered 4 hours after PALA .
On days 2 through 5 ,  5-FU was administered after PALA .
5-FU plus levamisole .
22. and 23 of each 5- FU cycle .
MOF-Strept .
For all regimens .
For the 5-FU plus thymidine regimen ,  patients were evaluated every 4 weeks ,  while for all other regimens ,  this evaluation occurred every 5 weeks .
Evaluation of Results .
The primary endpoint of our overall study was patient survival .
For the comparison of any one of our drug combinations with 5-FU .
A secondary objective was to assess objective response rates among those patients who had measurable disease .
Each combination regimen was compared to treatment with 5- FU alone with respect to duration of survival following randomization ,  time to disease progression .
objective regression rates among measurable patients ,  and toxic reactions .
RESULTS .
A total of 347 patients were randomized on this study .
Four patients were lost to analysis due to ineligibility or cancellation on the 5-FU alone arm ,  four patients on 5-FU plus PALA ,  two patients on 5-FU plus thymidine ,  two patients on MOF-Strept ,  and none on 5-FU plus levamisole .
Toxicity.5-FU plus PALA had substantially more frequent mucocutaneous reactions and somewhat more frequent diarrhea ,  but less hematologic toxicity than 5-FU alone or any of the other regimens .
On the other hand ,  5-FU plus thymidine had a reduced incidence of mucocutaneous reactions and of diarrhea with comparable hematologic toxicity when compared with 5-FU alone .
One patient died in irreversible coma .
There were three treatment-related deaths: one each on 5-FU alone ,  5-FU plus thymidine ,  and MOF-Strept .
Therapeutic Results .
None of the combination regimens showed a significant advantage to 5-FU used alone .
Table 4 shows the association of a number of patient characteristics with survival .
Figure 2 displays the patient survival according to treatment regimen .
The median survival for all patients was 81/4 months .
None of the combination regimens showed a significant superiority to 5-FU used alone .
This allowed for 60% of the full dose of both 5-FU and PALA to be administered .
With the 5-FU-thymidine combination ,  we observed a marked modulation of 5-FU effect with regard to both dose and toxicity .
The total dose of 5-FU in this combination was only 12% of the dosage of 5-FU used alone that would produce a comparable degree of hematologic toxicity .
