INTRODUCTION .
No substantial improvements have beenmade in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer in the past two decades .
As the bulk of pelvic diseaseincreases ,  the proportion of patients with disease recurrent or persistent in the pelvis as the only site of failure increases compared to the proportion developing distant metastases .
In addition to modifications of radiation therapy multiple studies have investigated ,  and are investigating ,  strategies that combine radiation with chemotherapy either as neoadjuvant or concurrent administration .
In vitro data suggested that the addition of infusional 5-FU to radiation therapy would enhance the radiation effect .
The attenuator was used throughout the treatment course in those treated with a box technique and for half the fractions in those treated with a parallel pair .
A factorial design was planned to test to what degree observed differences were attributable to either factor .
The ‘‘Lifetest Procedure’’ in SAS UNIX was used to compare survival curves .
Additionally ,  statistics testing homogeneity over strata were computed and checked .
Of the 234 patients randomized ,  221 were evaluable .
Only 17 were instratum 3 .
In view of the small number of patients in stratum 3 ,  a detailed breakdown of possible tumor prognostic factors is not shown .
In the ‘‘standard arm’’ (a) ,  53 of 54 received the prescribed tumor dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions .
The histopathology was not centrally reviewed .
Tumor was grade 1 in 8 of 221 (4%) ,  grade 2 in 106 of 221 (48%) ,  and grade 3 in 75 of the 221 (34%) .
Capillary lymphatic space (CLS) involvement was commented on in 146 of 221 (66%) .
CLS involvement was found in 34 of the 146 (23%) .
With a median duration of follow-up of 59 months ,  119 of 221 patients are alive ,  111 without evidence of disease ,  and 8 with disease present .
Eighty-four have died of disease and 4 have died of other causes with disease present .
For the purpose of analysis ,  the latter group are considered dead of disease .
The Kaplan–Meier plots of overall disease-free survival ,  disease-free survival for each stratum ,  and disease free survival by treatment assigned are shown in Figs. 2 ,  3 ,  and4 ,  respectively .
Thereis a trend in favor of standard radiation and 5-FU .
The disease-free survival by treatment arm for the 99 patients in stratum 1 is shown in Fig. 5 .
There was a significant improvement in 5-year survival and disease-free survival for those treated with standard radiation and 5-FU compared to the other treatments (log rank test P 5 0.05) .
The actuarial 5-year disease-free survival was 76% compared to 65% for hyperfractionated irradiation plus 5-FU ,  58% for hyperfractionated irradiation alone ,  and 39% for standard radiation .
Table 4 .
A factorial analysis of the magnitude of the impact of differences in the radiation schedule or the addition of 5-FU on the improvements in pelvic control and disease-free survival in stratum 1 was performed .
The 5-year Kaplan–Meier disease-free survival for those irradiated without 5-FU was 48% versus 71% for those who received 5-FU (log rank P 5 0.02) (Fig. 6) .
Pelvic control was 66% for those who did not receive 5-FU compared to 84% for those who did (P 5 0.07) .
We wished to determine whether there was an accumulation of ‘‘bad risk’’ factors in the group receiving standard radiation alone or alternatively that there was an accumulation of ‘‘good risk’’ factors in patients receiving standard RT and 5-FU .
For those receiving standard RT ,  the pelvic control rate was 60% but the disease-free survival was only 39% .
There appears to be no imbalance in the distribution by FIGO stage ,  cell type or CLS involvement .
Eight occurred in those receiving standard radiation and five in those receiving altered RT .
Seven occurred in the group receiving 5-FU and six in those without 5-FU .
DISCUSSION .
However ,  in stratum 1 constituted of patients with stage IB/IIA and those IIB tumors with medial parametrial involvement ,  a significant improvement in both pelvic control and disease-free survival in favor of standard radiation with concurrent 5-FU was observed (Figs. 5 and 6) .
The disease-free survival with standard radiation alone ,  however ,  was surprisingly low at 39% .
A factorial analysis compared the outcome for all patients treated with concurrent 5-FU compared to those without 5-FU .
The direction of benefit in favor of 5-FU with standard radiation compared to the other treatments was the same in strata 1 and 2 .
With so few randomized the possibility exists that an imbalance in prognostic factors exists between the treatment arms might account for the observed outcome differences .
The risk ratio for recurrence and death from disease was reduced to 0.49 (95% confidence interval 0.25 to 0.97) .
Since the data are not conclusive because of limited numbers ,  confirmation of the beneficial effects observed in this study is necessary .
