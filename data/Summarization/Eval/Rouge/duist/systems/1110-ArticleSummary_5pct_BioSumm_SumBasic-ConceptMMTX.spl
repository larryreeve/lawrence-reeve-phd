Women were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria ,  disease outside the pelvic area or spread to para-aortic lymph nodes ,  a prior cancer other than cutaneous basal-cell carcinoma ,  medical contraindications to chemotherapy ,  a rare histologic subtype ,  and prior hysterectomy or transperitoneal staging procedure for cervical cancer ,  pelvic radiotherapy ,  or systemic chemotherapy .
To avoid treatment delays ,  intracavitary insertions were performed without chemotherapy if a patient had a granulocyte count of less than 1500 per cubic millimeter and a platelet count of less than 100,000 per cubic millimeter .
Toxicity was assessed at the time of each evaluation with use of the Cooperative Group Common Toxicity Criteria ,  the Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria ,  and the Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Scheme of the RTOG and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer .
Radiotherapy records ,  including data concerning external-beam fields ,  intracavitary placement ,  doses of radiation to tumor and normal tissues ,  and other treatment variables ,  were reviewed by a radiation oncologist .
Five-year rates of secondary end points such as locoregional recurrence ,  para-aortic recurrence ,  and distant metastasis were estimated with the use of cumulative-incidence methods , and treatment effects were tested with use of the Gray algorithm .
Fifteen patients (4 percent) — six in the combined-therapy group and nine in the radiotherapy group — were subsequently disqualified because of failure to undergo the required evaluation of para-aortic lymph nodes (eight patients) ,  the presence of extrapelvic cancer (two) ,  the presence of a rare histologic subtype (one) ,  the presence of a stage IB1 tumor with no involvement of pelvic nodes (one) ,  the absence of pretreatment data (two) ,  and receipt of chemotherapy before radiotherapy (one) .
Although the group reported significant improvements in overall and disease-free survival with the addition of hydroxyurea therapy ,  the study has been criticized for the use of a low dose of radiation and the poor survival rates in both groups and because more than half of the 190 patients who were enrolled could not be evaluated .
Despite these criticisms ,  the resultsof that study and those of trials assessing concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy for other tumors stimulated studies of the effects of radiotherapy and various combinations of fluorouracil ,  cisplatin ,  mitomycin ,  carboplatin ,  and paclitaxel as treatments for locally advanced cervical cancer.The results of these trials have been encouraging ,  but mostclinicians have not found them sufficiently  convincing to justify the inclusion of chemotherapy in the routine treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer .
