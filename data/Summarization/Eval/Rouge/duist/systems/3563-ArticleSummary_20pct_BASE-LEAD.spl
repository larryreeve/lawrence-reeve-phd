Intestinal anastomosis has been successfully performed for more than 150 years using a variety of techniques ,  materials ,  and devices .
Of these ,  the method that has proven successful in most situations and in the hands of most surgeons has been the two-layer anastomosis using interrupted silk sutures for an outer inverted seromuscular layer and a running absorbable suture for a transmural inner layer .
The only appreciable shortcoming of the two-layer technique is that it is somewhat tedious and time-consuming to perform .
Recently ,  several reports have appeared advocating a single-layer continuous anastomosis using monofilament plastic suture .
This anastomosis requires less time to fashion ,  costs less than any other method ,  and may have a lower risk of leakage .
Because of these potential advantages ,  we hypothesized that the single-layer technique could be introduced into our surgical teaching program with no increase in anastomotic failure and that it could be performed in less time than the two-layer technique .
METHODS .
All adult patients requiring intestinal anastomosis at Denver Health Medical Center from September 1996 to September 1999 were considered eligible .
Patients requiring anastomosis to the rectum or third or fourth portion of the duodenum were excluded because the single-layer continuous method is awkward when both ends of the bowel cannot be fully mobilized .
Patients requiring gastrointestinal anastomosis were excluded because of the presumably increased risk of hemorrhage from the stomach .
Patients were also excluded if the surgeon did not believe that either technique could be used because of technical concerns such as edema or scarring .
Patients were assigned to either the one-or two-layer technique in a prospective ,  randomized fashion .
Randomization was performed using random permuted blocks of size 10 .
Opaque ,  sealed envelopes indicating the technique to be used were placed in the operating room and were drawn sequentially when the need for intestinal anastomosis became apparent .
The study was approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board ,  which also granted a waiver of consent because both methods were in common use in our institution and had similar results .
All two-layer anastomoses were constructed using interrupted 3.0 silk Lembert sutures for the outer layer and a running 3.0 polyglycolic acid suture for the transmural inner layer .
All single-layer anastomoses were constructed using a continuous 3.0 polypropylene double-needle suture that began at the mesenteric border (Fig. 1) .
All layers of the bowel wall except the mucosa were incorporated .
Each bite included 4 to 6 mm of the seromuscular wall ,  the larger bites were used at the mesenteric border to ensure an adequate seal .
Each stitch was advanced approximately 5 mm. To avoid ischemia of the anastomosis ,  the surgeon had to ensure that only enough pressure was applied to the suture while following to approximate the ends of the bowel and render the anastomosis watertight .
