Certain clinical and pathologic risk factors for Stage 1 cervical cancer recurrence have been identified .
Pelvic lymph node metastases ,  for example have been known to decrease the 5-year survival from 82 to 90% in patients with negative nodes to 38 to 61% in patients with positive lymph nodes .
Additional risk factors for recurrence ,  e.g. ,  large tumor diameter (LTD) ,  deep stromal invasion (DSI) ,  and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces (CLS) found on microscopic examination have been only recently recognized and less extensively investigated than lymph node metastases .
However ,  sufficient data have been reported in the literature to categorize LTD ,  DSI ,  and CLS as independent risk factors because of their frequent association with increased cancer recurrence and mortality .
An analysis of data on 575 women enrolled in a previous Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) study of clinical and pathologic predictors of surgically treated stage carcinoma of the cervix confirmed the roles of LTD ,  DSI ,  and CLS as risk factors ,  increasing the probability of cancer recurrence at 3 years from 2 to 31% .
Furthermore ,  that study estimated that the proportion of women with such risk factors was 25% of all Stage IB cervical cancer patients with negative lymph nodes .
In 1988 the GOG initiated a prospective randomized study (GOG #92) ,  reported here ,  to investigate the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy for Stage I cervical cancer patients treated by conventional radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who were at high risk for recurrence ,  because of LTD ,  DSI ,  CLS ,  but excluding patients with lymph node metastases .
The GOG #92 multicenter prospective randomized study was designed to determine whether postoperative pelvic radiotherapy following radical hysterectomy and pelvic node dissection would reduce the rate of recurrence and decrease the mortality in Stage IB cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter ,  deep stromal invasion by tumor ,  and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces found on microscopic examination .
A previous GOG study estimated that women with one of the following combinations of risk factors had ,  on average ,  a 31% chance of recurring in 3 years .
Patients were eligible for the study if they had primary Stage IB squamous ,  adenosquamous carcinoma ,  or adenocarcinoma of cervix initially treated with a standard radical hysterectomy and who had negative lymph nodes but one of the previously described combination of risk factors .
Other eligibility criteria for enrollment into the study included normal blood counts ,  normal liver and kidney function ,  absence of genitourinary tract abnormality as determined by intravenous pyelogram ,  renal sonogram ,  or computerized tomography ,  and absence of intercurrent diseases or other conditions that might not permit completion of the study or the required follow-up .
All histology slides were reviewed by two pathologists of the GOG Pathology Committee who measured the depth of stromal invasion expressed in thirds of cervical thickness and ascertained the presence or absence of the capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement and the tumor cell type .
Twenty-two patients were excluded ,  14 because of lack of documentation of high risk criteria ,  4 for wrong stage ,  1 for inadequate surgery ,  2 for inadequate pathology material for review ,  and 1 for not having an intravenous pyelogram or CT scan .
There were 128 (46%) patients with the risk factors of positive CLS and deep one-third stromal invasion ,  65 (23%) had positive CLS ,  middle third stromal invasion and tumor size $2 cm ,  82 (30%) had negative CLS ,  middle or deep third stromal invasion and a $4-cm tumor ,  and 2 (0.7%) had positive CLS ,  superficial stromal invasion ,  and tumor size $5 cm (Table 3) .
However ,  the overall risk for recurrence was very similar in each regimen when all three risk factors were considered as a group (See Cox Model analyses) .
The crude estimate in the reduction in risk in patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy was 47% (i.e. ,  relative risk 5 0.53) with the recurrence-free rate of 88% in the radiotherapy group and 79% in the no-further-therapy group at 2 years (Fig. 1) .
The Cox model analysis indicated that when adjusting for all combinations of the three risk factors—tumor size ,  CLS ,  and the depth of invasion—the risk of recurrence was significantly reduced by 44% in the radiation group (P 5 0.019 ,  one-tail) .
Thirty (21%) patients among those in the NFT group died ,  25 (18%) from cancer ,  compared to 18 (13%) deaths in the RT group ,  15 (11%) of whom died from cancer with one attributable to treatment (Table 5) .
Nine (7.0%) of the 128 patients who received radiotherapy had 11 episodes of grade 3 (severe) or 4 (life-threatening) adverse effects compared to 3 (2.1%) from the NFT group .
Deep tumor invasion into cervical stroma (measured either in millimeters or in thirds of the total cervical thickness) has been also shown in association withlymph node metastases ,  recurrence ,  and poorer survival .
Nevertheless ,  we found tumor diameter to be the most significant risk factors in the Cox model analysis of our study results ,  confirming multiple data sets which demonstrate that the size of the primary cancer is critical for local control despite the imprecision of measurement .
A detailed GOG clinical pathologic study had established that certain patients with poor prognostic factors related to the primary tumor (i.e. ,  large tumor size ,  deep stromal invasion ,  and capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement) but without lymph node involvement had a risk of recurrence of 31% after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy .
The present prospective randomized study showed that adjunctive radiotherapy significantly reduced the number of cancer recurrences in women with the above risk factors by 44% and that the difference in recurrences between irradiated and nonirradiated patients was statistically significant at the P 5 0.019 level .
The use of adjuvant radiotherapy to improve the outcome in the Stage I cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter ,  deep invasion ,  and CLS has been previously proposed .
Interestingly ,  our prospective study did provide conclusive evidence of pelvic radiotherapy being effective in women with primary tumor-related risk factors but negative nodes .
The GOG attempted to conduct a randomized radiotherapy trial for women with positive nodes ,  but could not complete the study because of failure to enroll a sufficient number of patients (unpublished GOG data) .
A significant number of women with Stage IB cervical cancer should benefit from adjuvant pelvic irradiation because 25% of the lymph-node negative patients have high risk factors according to the 1990 GOG data .
Moreover ,  Thomas and Dembo have demonstrated that ,  in absolute terms ,  an equal number of deaths occur among the estimated 85% of Stage IB cervical cancer patients with negative nodes as among the 15% with positive nodes .
Since the node-negative group accounts for one-half of all Stage IB cervical cancer deaths adjuvant radiotherapy for women with risk factors should substantially reduce the overall Stage IB mortality .
Thus ,  adjunctive radiotherapy is beneficial for Stage I cervical cancer patients with clinical–pathological risk factors for recurrence other than positive nodes .
