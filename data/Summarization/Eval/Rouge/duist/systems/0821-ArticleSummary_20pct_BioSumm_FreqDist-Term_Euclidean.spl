THE ANTIMETABOLITES methotrexate (MTX) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) have become established over the past quarter century among the most useful cancer chemotherapeutic agents .
However ,  synergy is not observed in the presence of physiologic concentrations of purines ,  raising doubts about its clinical relevance .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Histopathologic confirmation of diagnosis .
Informed consent was obtained in accordance with the requirements of the institutional ethics committee .
SEQUENTIAL MTX/5-FU .
In either case ,  the dose of MTX was 250 mg/m2 ,  and the dose of 5-FU was 600 mg/m2 .
Default conditions for the inclusion and exclusion of terms were used ,  and the MLR stepping option selected .
RESULTS .
Response category was not included in this model ,  as it represented a consequence of therapy .
Among patients with colorectal cancer ,  responses were seen in 33% of all entered patients ,  including 40% (95% confidence limit ,  19%- 64%) of those evaluable for response .
DISCUSSION .
In the small number of patients with colorectal cancer we observed a response rate of 33% (40% of evaluable patients) ,  a figure somewhat higher than that usually seen after 5-FU as a single agent ,  but the 95% confidence limits for this rate (19%-64%) emphasize that this could be a chance observation .
Antagonism could have provided a therapeutic advantage if it were more marked in normal tissues than in tumor ,  as higher doses could then have been used in the FM arm .
Such a differential effect was conceivable in view of the widely differing purine concentrations in bone marrow and peripheral blood .
This prediction is based on results obtained in tissue culture using low purine concentrations ,  and its relevance to effects in vivo remains uncertain .
They were unable to show a benefit for sequential administration ,  indeed ,  the trend in their study favored the simultaneous therapy group .
