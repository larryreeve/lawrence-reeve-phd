The nationwide use of such screening programs has greatly reduced the incidence of invasive cervical cancer .
We report the first results of this study .
The radiation dose was keyed to the central ray at the patient’s midplane (for anteroposterior– posteroanterior fields) or to the isocenter of the beams .
The total dose to be delivered to pelvic lymph nodes as well as to para-aortic nodes was 45 Gy ,  given at a dose of 1.8 Gy per fraction of radiation .
The radioisotopes used for low-dose-rate intracavitary radiotherapy were cesium-137 or radium-226 in 392 of 402 patients (98 percent) .
Interstitial brachytherapy was used only if necessary to increase the dose directedat distal vaginal sites of disease .
The protocol specified that all patients receive a total cumulative dose to point A (a reference location 2 cm lateral and 2 cmsuperior to the cervical os) of at least 85 Gy .
Within 16 hours after the first radiation fraction was administered ,  patients in the combination-therapy group received the first cycle of chemotherapy ,  which consisted of an intravenous infusion of 75 mg of cisplatin per square meter of body-surface area over a 4-hour period followed by an intravenous infusion of 4000 mg of fluorouracil per square meter over a 96-hour period .
Two additional cycles of chemotherapy were scheduled at three-week intervals .
One of these was administered at the time of the second intracavitary insertion .
All chemotherapy records were reviewed by a gynecologic oncologist to assess compliance with the protocol .
Variations were scored as minor ,  major but acceptable ,  or major and unacceptable ,  if they differed by more than 5 ,  10 ,  or 20 percent ,  respectively ,  from the specified dose of radiation or duration of treatment .
Overall survival was the primary end point for the comparison of the two treatments and was calculated from the date of study entry until the date of death or the date of the last follow-up visit .
Disease- free survival was also compared in the two groups and was calculated from the date of study entry to the date of the first occurrence of disease progression ,  a second diagnosis of cancer ,  or death from any cause ,  or if none of these events occurred ,  to the date of the last follow-up visit .
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate both survival rates .
The statistical significance of associations between treatment assignments and characteristics of the patients was assessed by chi-square analysis .
Treatment and Compliance .
Radiotherapy was delivered according to the protocol or with minor deviations in 83 percent of the patients in the combined-therapy group and 84 percent of those in the radiotherapy group .
The median total duration of radiation was 58 days ,  with a mean dose of 89 Gy delivered to point A in each group .
Of the 195 patients in the combination-therapy group ,  159 (81 percent) completed at least two cycles of chemotherapy ,  and 133 (68 percent) completed three cycles .
Four patients refused or were unable to receive ny chemotherapy but were included in the analysis according to the intention to treat .
The median duration of follow-up was 43 months .
Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that overall survival rates were significantly better among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy than among those treated with radiotherapy alone (73 percent vs. 58 percent ,  P=0.004) (Table 5 and Fig. 1) .
Disease-free survivalat five years was 67 percent in the combined-therapy group and 40 percent in the radiotherapy group ,  according to Kaplan–Meier analysis (P<0.001) (Fig. 2) .
Approximately 70 percent of the patients assigned to each group had stage IB ,  IIA ,  or IIB disease .
For these patients ,  overall survival was significantly better if they were treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
Although chemotherapy  increased the hematologic toxicity ,  this effect was reversible and the incidence of late side effects was similar in the two treatment groups .
As a result ,  the median dose was higher and the median duration of treatment was shorter than those reported in other studies .
We used a higher dose of cisplatin (75 mg per square meter) than that used with fluorouracil in the Gynecologic Oncology Group studies ,  and we also included a third cycle of chemotherapy during one of the intracavitary procedures .
