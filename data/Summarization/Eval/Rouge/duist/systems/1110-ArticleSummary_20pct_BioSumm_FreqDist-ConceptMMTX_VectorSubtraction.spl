OF the estimated 13,700 women in the United States in whom invasive cervical cancer was diagnosed in 1998 ,  nearly 5000 will ultimately die of the disease because of the inadequacies of current treatment .
In the United States ,  cervical cancer disproportionately affects women who are members of minority groups and women of low socioeconomic status ,  partly because such women tend to have insufficient access to and knowledge of screening programs for cervical cancer .
Women with early cervical cancer can be successfully treated with radical surgery .
METHODS .
Patients were required to understand the trial and provide written informed consent .
The radiation dose was keyed to the central ray at the patient’s midplane (for anteroposterior– posteroanterior fields) or to the isocenter of the beams .
Brachytherapy was performed within two weeks (preferably less than one week) after the completion of pelvic radiation ,  with the goal of keeping the total duration of treatment under eight weeks when possible .
Statistical Analysis .
Overall survival was the primary end point for the comparison of the two treatments and was calculated from the date of study entry until the date of death or the date of the last follow-up visit .
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate both survival rates .
The statistical significance of associations between treatment assignments and characteristics of the patients was assessed by chi-square analysis .
To detect such a difference ,  we predicted that we would need to enroll 400 women in the study over a four-year period and then follow them for an additional four years .
We estimated that 199 women would have died by the time of the initial analysis of treatment .
The results of the interim analyses ,  in which patients’ treatment assignments were masked ,  were presented to the datamonitoring committee .
At the interim analysis conducted in July 1998 after the enrollment goal was met ,  the difference between the two groups was determined to have met the requirements for early reporting .
Characteristics of the Patients .
The characteristics of the two treatment groups are summarized in Table 2 .
There were no significant differences in these characteristics between the groups .
The median total duration of radiation was 58 days ,  with a mean dose of 89 Gy delivered to point A in each group .
Side Effects .
Although moderate (grade 3) and severe (grade 4) side effects occurred more frequently during or within 60 days after the completion of treatment with combined therapy than with radiotherapy alone ,  these effects were usually self-limited or resolved with medical management (Table 3) .
There were no significant differences in the seriousness of late effects between the treatment groups .
Outcome .
Follow-up data were available for 193 of the 195 patients in the combined-therapy group and for all 193 patients in the radiotherapy group .
For these patients ,  overall survival was significantly better if they were treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
DISCUSSION .
Our treatment regimen differed from previous regimens in several ways .
The importance of this third cycle is uncertain ,  but because close to 25 percentof the total paracentral dose of radiation is delivered with each intracavitary procedure ,  the addition of concurrent chemotherapy during this time may be important .
The acute side effects were severe ,  possibly because of the addition of chemotherapy or the altered regimen of fractionation .
