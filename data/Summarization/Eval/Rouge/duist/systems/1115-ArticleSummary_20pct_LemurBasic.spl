an analysis of the patterns of failure after radiation therapy in locally advanced cervical cancer reveals that of those who recur over 70 have some component of pelvic failure as the first site of relapse and two thirds develop some component of distant disease 
the problem of enhancing pelvic control and survival cannot be approached simply by increasing conventionally delivered radiation dose since late complications produced by radiation are at the upper limit of acceptability with currently employed doses 
these include modifications of radiation treatment volume or fractionation including extended field radiation hyperfractionated rt strategies to overcome the negative impact of tumor hypoxia such as hyperbaric oxygen or hypoxic cell radiation sensitizers 
these advantages include no delay in the start of definitive irradiation no prolongation of overall treatment time thus minimizing the theoretical risk of accelerated clonogen proliferation during the antineoplastic course and possible interaction of the concurrently administered chemotherapy with radiation through such mechanisms as inhibition of repair of radiation damage cell synchronization recruitment of nonproliferating cells into cell cycle and reduction of the hypoxic fraction 
theoretical disadvantages of concurrent administration include increased acute toxicity which might limit or delay the delivery of definitive irradiation or increased late toxicity particularly if the drugs and radiation do not exhibit toxicity independence 
while these studies suggested some benefit for patients with figo stage iiib cancer methodological problems in the study have not resulted in wide acceptance of the conclusion of benefit from concurrent hydroxyurea and its concurrent use has not entered standard practice 
interest in infusional 5 fluorouracil 5 fu with or without other agents such as mitomycin c and cisplatin developed from both laboratory data suggesting enhanced tumor cell kill over radiation alone and clinical data 
the success of concurrent regimens with these agents in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of other sites such as the anal canal and esophagus suggested that similar regimens were worthy of exploration in carcinomas of the cervix 
the optimal dosing schedule for maximizing cell kill with infusional 5 fu and radiation remains undefined but laboratory data suggested greater effects with increasing dose and prolonged exposure to 5 fu and when drug was present for intervals in excess of 48 h after radiation 
an earlier extensive phase i ii study of radical irradiation and infusional 5 fu based on the in vitro information established a safe regimen with acceptable toxicity for comparison in this randomized study 
between may of 1987 and august of 1995 234 patients predominantly from two centers with others participating were stratified by their extent of pelvic disease and randomized to receive one of four possible treatments 
patients were randomized to receive either a standard external beam pelvic irradiation ebrt in a dose of 5000 cgy in 25 fractions defined at 100 versus b rt as in arm a with infusional intravenous 5 fu in a dose of 1 g m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of rt c partially hyperfractionated rt 5280 cgy in 33 fractions 2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of rt or d arm c with the same infusional 5 fu 
the superior border of the radiation treatment volume was the l5 s1 junction the inferior the bottom of the obdurator foramina or 2 cm below the lowest identified extent of vaginal disease 
the anterior border of the lateral fields was in front of the symphysis pubis while the posterior border was tailored to the clinical evaluation of the presence or absence of utero sacral disease extension 
it was loaded to extend at least 2 cm above the clinically identified superior extent of disease and inferiorly to 1 cm below the cervix or 1 cm below the lowest extent of vaginal disease identified after external therapy 
for rare patients with disease extension to the lower one third of vagina the first application to the cervix and uterus was modified to deliver 30 gy at 2 cm from the center of the sources and a second application as a line source in the vagina was used to deliver a further 20 gy at 0 5 cm depth from the surface of the vagina 5 fu was given as an infusion from days 1 to 4 inclusive and on treatment days 22 to 25 inclusive 
figure 1 demonstrates the study design the four arm study was designed to determine whether any significant differences in outcome were evident between arms a and d and to be explanatory with respect to causation 
assuming that the magnitude and direction of the 5 fu effects were similar in arms b and d then the effect of the addition of 5 fu could be tested by comparing arms b and d with arms a and c 
the reduced fraction size in arms c and d was designed to attempt to take advantage of knowledge of the affect of fraction size on late complications and to determine whether complication rates were decreased by using decreased fraction size 
additionally the changed fractionation scheme with delivery of two fractions daily at the beginning and end of therapy was designed to maximize the potential for interaction between 5 fu and radiation and to potentially reduce complication rates 
in order to detect a 20 improvement in pelvic control rate from an expected 50 for arm a to 70 for arm d assuming an alpha of 0 05 and beta of 0 20 73 patients in each of four treatment arms would be required for a total of 292 patients 
in order to detect an improvement of 15 in survival in arms c and d compared to that seen in arms a and b assuming a 40 cause specific survival rate in arm a and an alpha of 0 05 and beta of 0 2 the total number of patients required was 272 
oral mucositis due to 5 fu was graded on a scale of 0 to 4 1 pain without frank ulceration 2 ulceration present but able to eat 3 ulceration requiring a liquid diet 4 alimentation not possible 
cytopenias were classed as grade 3 if bleeding or infection fever occurred due to low blood counts and grade 2 if neutrophils were less than 1000 units l or platelets less than 50 000 units l 
for strata 1 and 2 the distribution of figo stage tumor size nodal involvement on lymphography tumor grade and capillary lymphatic space involvement cls for each treatment are shown in tables 1 and 2 
of the 23 patients who received no intracavitary radiation or doses less than 500 cgy there was a relatively even distribution across the treatment arms with 5 in arm a 5 in arm b 3 in arm c and 9 in arm d 
a factorial analysis of the magnitude of the impact of differences in the radiation schedule or the addition of 5 fu on the improvements in pelvic control and disease free survival in stratum 1 was performed 
in examining the effect of the addition of 5 fu on disease free survival in stratum 1 there is a highly significant difference in favor of the use of 5 fu regardless of the radiation employed 
however in evaluating the importance of the contribution of the change in fractionation to the differences observed there was no significant difference in the 5 year survival of those treated on standard radiation versus those treated with hyperfractionated irradiation whether or not 5 fu was used 
it was hoped that the use of two treatments daily during the 5 fu infusion would increase any opportunity for 5 fu radiation interaction by increasing the total amount of radiation given concurrently with 5 fu 
since significant differences in pelvic control and survival were observed in stratum 1 which contained only 99 patients it is important to examine whether there was an uneven distribution of other possible patient or tumor related prognostic factors across the treatment arms to account for the differences observed 
we wished to determine whether there was an accumulation of bad risk factors in the group receiving standard radiation alone or alternatively that there was an accumulation of good risk factors in patients receiving standard rt and 5 fu 
the crude incidence of 5 9 13 of 221 presents a good estimate of the overall risk for chronic bowel complications in survivors since most occur in the first 3 years after radiation therapy 
other than the report on the use of concurrent hydroxyurea this is the first published report of the results of a randomized study examining the role of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation in advanced cervical cancer 
to reach the conclusion that concurrent chemotherapy truly adds benefit to results achievable with radiation alone it is important that the radiation be delivered in an optimal manner with adequate doses at point a 80 to 90 gy and limited overall treatment times 
however in stratum 1 constituted of patients with stage ib iia and those iib tumors with medial parametrial involvement a significant improvement in both pelvic control and disease free survival in favor of standard radiation with concurrent 5 fu was observed figs 5 and 6 
the tumor and patient related factors examined were figo stage ib versus iia versus iib size of tumor greater or less than 6 cm and greater or less than 7 cm grade of tumor the presence or absence of capillary like space involvement nodal involvement and patient age as a continuous variable 
the changed fractionation scheme using smaller than conventional fraction sizes and a 6 increase in total dose was designed to be approximately biologically equivalent for tumor control to that of standard radiation yet lead to reduced complications 
the observed complication rate in any of the treatment arms appears acceptable 7 with standard radiation whether or not 5 fu was added and 4 in the hyperfractionated radiation arms whether or not 5 fu was added 
theoretical explanations for the lack of benefit may include a reduction in tumor cell kill due to the reduced radiation fraction size and or an insufficient compensatory increase in total dose to compensate for the reduced fraction size 
the lack of significant benefit for 5 fu in stratum 2 may be due to the small sample size or theoretically that the added chemotherapy was insufficient to significantly impact on more advanced disease 
from the subset analysis of this trial we have generated the hypothesis that there may be a beneficial effect of adding concurrent infusional 5 fu to standard in patients with the disease characteristics of stratum 1
