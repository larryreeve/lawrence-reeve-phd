After radical mastectomy ,  eligible patients were prospectively randomized to receive either no further treatment or 12 monthly cycles of adjuvant CMF .
All our progress reports have consistently demonstrated that there was a significant difference in the relapse-free survival (RFS) favoring patients who received adjuvant CMF .
In fact ,  a relative shortterm adjuvant systemic treatment would spare the patients a considerable amount of toxicity .
The preliminary 3-yr results have shown that in premenopausal women ,  6 cycles of CMF yielded results that were identical to those obtained with 12 cycles .
Within 4 wk from surgery ,  patients with TI-3a breast cancer ,  histologically positive axillary nodes ,  age < 70 yr ,  and living fairly close to the Institute were allocated to receive either 12 or 6 cycles of CMF .
No postoperative radiotherapy or any other ancillary treatment was given .
The dose of all three drugs was reduced by 50% when the leukocyte count ranged from 3900 to 2500/cu mm or the platelet count from 99,000 to 75,000/cu mm. In the presence of more severe myelosuppression ,  treatment was delayed until at least half of the dose could be administered .
The following systemic treatment was mainly utilized ,  patients in whom estrogen receptors were positive were subjected to hormonal manipulations (ovariectomy in premenopausal women and additive hormonal therapy ,  particularly tamoxifen ,  in postmenopausal patients) ,  combined sometimes with chemotherapy .
When estrogen receptors were negative or could not be determined ,  systemic treatment consisted of combination chemotherapy utilizing preferentially an adriamycin- containing regimen .
It appears evident that treatment regimens were unable to significantly affect the RFS within each patient subset .
In postmenopausal women with more than 3 nodes ,  the difference between CMF 12 (34.4%) and CMF 6 (54.9% ,  p = 0.18) is only apparent since the confidence-limits throughout the curve totally blurred the percent difference (standard error ,  or SE ,  at 5 yr ,  8.4 and 11.3 ,  respectively) .
It is important to emphasize that overall no RFS difference was documented between preand postmenopausal patients (CMF 12 ,  59.3% versus 57.6% ,  CMF 6 ,  66.5% versus 63.1% , respectively) .
The somewhat contrasting results observed in the 6-cycle group in pre- and postmenopausal patients with 1-3 nodes (80.3% versus 66.1%) again reflect only a fictitious difference (SE ,  4.1 and 8.1 ,  respectively) .
On the contrary ,  in both treatmentand menopausal groups ,  RFS was affected by the number of involved nodes (Table 1) .
In fact ,  premenopausal patients in the 12-cycle group had a 72% 5-yr survival compared to 77.1% for women in the 6-cycle group (p = 0.20) .
No substantial difference was also documented in the pattern of new disease manifestations ,  either local-regional or distant ,  between pre- and postmenopausal women .
As can be seen ,  RFS was superior in patients with ER + tumors ,  but this difference failed to reach statistical significance in all patient subsets .
Also ,  no difference was evident when overall survival of postmenopausal women was examined (ER+ 82.5% versus ER- 76.2% ,  p =0.32) .
In fact ,  there was no striking difference in the pattern of new disease manifestations between ER + and ER - tumors ,  since visceral involvement was documented in 31.2% and 35.3% ,  respectively ,  of relapsed patients .
Furthermore ,  within each dose level ,  there was no statistically significant difference between patients in the 12- or 6-cycle group .
The observation that in some patient subsets 6 cycles of CMF yielded apparently superior results to 12 cycles is probably related to the relative number of patients in each group and to the different median follow-up in postmenopausal women  whose accrual was discontinued in December 1976 .
Another important finding to be considered is the pattern of new disease manifestations where no differencein the frequency of local-regional and/or distant areas was evident between the two treatment groups .
Thus ,  all above reported findings strongly support our preliminary 3-yr results and indicate that utilizing a single multidrug regimen ,  it is possible to reduce the duration of adjuvant treatment in operable breast cancer without compromising the therapeutic results .
Henderson et al.15 reported that at 6 yr of follow-up (median 2.6 yr) ,  no RFS or survival difference was evident between the two groups .
It appears evident that ,  (A) the two series given 12 cycles of CMF achieved the same results ,  (B) the data reported in the three series treated with CMF are almost equivalent ,  (C) adjuvant CMF ,  whether administered for 12 or 6 cycles ,  was able to alter the course of operable breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes compared to the group subjected to radical mastectomy alone .
The first and most important one is that there appears to be no real difference following adjuvant chemotherapy ,  namely CMF ,  between the RFS of pre- versus postmenopausal women (CMF 12 ,  59.3% versus 57.6% ,  CMF 6 ,  66.5% versus 63.1% ,  respectively) .
We had previously reported4 that the different results observed in our first adjuvant program were probably due to the low-dose CMF started in 31 of 104 postmenopausal patients (30%) because of elderly age .
The results obtained in our series between ER + and ER - tumors ,  coupled with the overall findings observed in the two menopausal groups ,  further contribute to minimize the possible therapeutic role of chemotherapy-induced adjuvant castration in premenopausal women .
Therefore ,  there are no sound clinical reasons to prolong treatment utilizing the same drugs beyond a 6-mo period .
Also ,  the Arizona group utilizing a different combination regimen ,  i.e. ,  adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide ,  for about 6 mo achieved a 5-yr RFS that is very similar to that observed in ourstudies .
Thus ,  from available reports it appears that different adjuvant treatments consisting of a single multidrug regimen can achieve comparable RFS results regardless of treatment duration .
Since our current results with adjuvant CMF are comparable to those utilizing a 5-drug combination or an adriamycin-containing regimen ,  clinical research efforts should now aim at improving the intrinsic limitation of a single multidrug regimen .
Our current protocols are testing sequential versus alternating delivery of CMF and adriamycin ,  since our previous experience has demonstrated that both treatments are equally effective and non-cross-resistant .
In the presence of myelosuppression(leukocytes < 3800/cu mm and/or platelets < 100,000/cu mm) on day 22 ,  treatment is delayed 1-2 wk to allow a constant delivery of full doses .
Only long-term analysis will answer the questions of whether the addition of adjuvant hormone therapy to chemotherapy will improve the results in ER + tumors and whether the excellent results reported by the M D Anderson Hospital with FAC (fluorouracil ,  adriamycin ,  cyclophosphamide) in women with > 4 axillary nodes 7 will be reproducible .
