These doses of radiation were chosen after trials by the Veterans Administration Surgical Adjuvant Group and the Princess Margaret Hospital ,  Toronto ,  suggested survival advantage with radiotherapy for patients with tumours of Dukes stage C .
In 1981 ,  the MRC began this trial of a higher dose of preoperative radiotherapy in patients with fixed or partially fixed tumours of the rectum who were thought to be suitable for abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection .
Two parallel opposed fields 18 cm by 15 cm were positioned to cover the tumour with an adequate proximal margin (normally 5 cm). 20 daily fractions of 2 Gy at the mid-plane central axis of the volume of the tumour were given over 4 weeks .
The surviving patients were followed-up for a minimum of 5 years with the exception of seven patients ,  lost to follow-up within 5 years of randomisation ,  who could not be traced through the OPCS and were censored at the date last known to be alive .
Fewer deaths were reported to have been from colorectal cancer or complications of the disease or its treatment among patients allocated preoperative radiotherapy than among those allocated surgery alone (85 vs 103 ,  hazard ratio 0.71 [0.54-0.97] ,  p=0.02) .
The reasons for investigating preoperative radiation therapy were ,  reduction in size of the primary tumour and frequency of regional node metastases before resection ,  a reduction in the frequency of local pelvic recurrence and of distant metastasis from cancer cells released during resection (preoperative treatment can inhibit the proliferation of malignant cells whether they remain local or spread outside the pelvis after radiation) ,  radiation responsiveness of cancer cells may be greater before surgery when they are normally oxygenated than afterwards when they may be hypoxic because of surgical effects on the vasculature ,  and a lower frequency of late radiation enteritis because the small bowel is less likely to be adherent in the pelvis .
