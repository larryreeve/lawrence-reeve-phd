Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-2. leukocyte count >3.0 x 10/L ,  platelet count > 100 x 10/L and adequate renal function (scrum creatinine <90 umol/L or creatinine clearance > 1.0 mL/sec) were required .
Statistical analysis used BMDP statistical software to prepare and compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves (program BMDPIL) for the group as a whole and for subgroups by primary site ,  treatment sequence ,  performance status ,  sex ,  age group ,  and response to therapy .
Among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer ,  disease stage expressed as TNM separately and as stage grouping ,  using standard definitions of the American Joint Committee for Cancer Staging and- End Result reporting were also examined as possible prognostic factors for response and survival .
Variables included in the Cox models for all patients with head and neck cancer were treatment group ,  prior radiotherapy ,  performance status ,  sex ,  and prior surgery .
Altogether ,  108 patients were entered ,  including 70 with head and neck cancer of whom 49 had received no prior chemotherapy ,  no radiotherapy ,  and no surgical treatment beyond diagnostic biopsy .
Four patients ,  two on each treatment sequence ,  died of treatment-related complications (sepsis in two patients ,  diarrhea in one ,  and aspiration pneumonia in one patient) ,  and a further patient developed prolonged neurologic toxicity with coma but recovered fully .
Response categories and median survival durations are summarized in Table 3 .
Even if the most extreme case is assumed and all four nonevaluable patients regarded as nonresponders ,  the difference was still not significant (P = .06 ,  Fisher's exact test ,  with no allowance for multiple comparisons) .
Because most responding patients with head and neck cancer received radiotherapy while still in response ,  no meaningful response duration could be determined ,  instead survival times are presented (Table 3) ,  with a median survival of at least 13 months in all groups .
Patients with head and neck cancer had significantly longer survival than those with other primary sites (P < .001) ,  reflecting the relatively earlier stage at which chemotherapy was used in head and neck cancer .
Survival duration was not significantly different by treatment sequence in univariate analyses ,  though the trend favored the sequence of 5-FU before MTX ,  in which the median survival had not been reached at 23 months ,  compared to a median survival of 13.3 months in the group receiving MTX before 5-FU .
Cox model multivariate analysis showed that ECOG performance status at study entry was the most significant prognostic factor for survival duration (P < .001) ,  and that ,  among the 70 patients with head and neck cancer ,  when allowance was made for performance status ,  a survival difference in favor of the "reverse" FM sequence emerged (P < .025) .
Other factors including stage ,  sex ,  prior radiotherapy ,  and prior surgery were not significant .
The median survival of colorectal cancer patients from start of treatment was only 4.6 months .
No significant sequence-dependent differences in response rate or survival duration were observed among the patients with colorectal cancer .
Biochemical and cell culture results from this laboratory suggested that the sequence-dependent synergy observed in vitro between MTX and 5-FU was reduced in the presence of 1-3 )umol/L hypoxanthine ,  a physiologic level found in human plasma .
The median survival from the start of chemotherapy was short (4.6 months) with no significant difference between the two treatment sequences in response rate or survival duration (Table 3) .
