The chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (600 mg per square meter of body-surface area) ,  methotrexate (40 mg per square meter) ,  and fluorouracil (600 mg per square meter) (the CMF regimen) ,  given intravenously every 21 days as described by Bonadonna et al. ,  initially for 12 months (80 patients) ,  and in the case of patients randomized after 1981 ,  for 6 months .
Also ,  as part of a second randomization ,  68 patients with estrogen-positive tumors were treated with radiationinduced ovarian ablation that included 20 Gy over a period of five days plus prednisone (7.5 mg per day) for two years ,  as described by Meakin et al. Among these 68 patients ,  33 were assigned to chemotherapy and 35 were assigned to chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
In the various analyses ,  we studied the following end points ,  any relapse of breast cancer (or death without a known relapse of breast cancer) ,  for the analysis of disease-free survival ,  locoregional recurrence as a first event ,  before a systemic recurrence (in the ipsilateral chest wall or an axillary ,  internal mammary ,  or supraclavicular node) ,  for the analysis of survival free of locoregional disease ,  any systemic relapse ,  with or without a locoregional relapse (or death without a known systemic relapse) ,  for the analysis of survival free of systemic disease ,  death from breast cancer ,  for the analysis of breast-cancer–specific survival ,  and any death ,  for the analysis of overall survival .
There was an overall reduction of 34 percent in the rate of systemic recurrence (relative risk ,  0.66 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.49 to 0.89 ,  P 0.006) in the group treated with combined therapy (75 of 164 patients vs. 94 of 154 patients in the group treated only with chemotherapy) ,  and a 17-percentage-point improvement in systemic disease-free survival (Fig. 2) .
The rate of locoregional recurrence was reduced by 56 percent (relative risk ,  0.44 ,  95 percent confidence interval ,  0.26 to 0.77 ,  P 0.003) in the group given chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (19 events ,  vs. 36 events in the group treated with chemotherapy only) ,  for an absolute improvement of 20 percent in survival free of local disease .
