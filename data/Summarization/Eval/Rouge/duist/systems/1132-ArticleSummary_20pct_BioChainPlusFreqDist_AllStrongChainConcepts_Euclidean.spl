ALTHOUGH much progress has been made in the early detection and control of carcinoma of the cervix since the introduction of  the Papanicolau test ,  it is estimated that about 13,500 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 1990 in  the United States with 6,000 patients dying from the disease .
Here we report the results of this study .
Clinical assessment of tumor extension was performed  by two investigators ,  and a pretreatment gynecologic examination under anesthesia was not required .
The groups were balanced for age ,  extension of parametrial disease ,  lymph node involvement ,   hemoglobin level ,  bulkiness of the cervical disease ,  and the presence of hydronephrosis .
The superior limit of the radiation field  was the L5-S1 junction ,  the lower limit wasthe caudal pole of obturator foramen ,  and the lateral boundaries were 1.5 cm  beyond the lymph nodes as demonstrated on lymphangiography .
A dose of 40 Gy was routinely prescribed to point A ,  which was located 2 cm superior  to the cervical os (applicator flange) and 2 cm lateral to the central axis of the uterus .
This RT regimen was used for both  groups .
The third bleomycin cycle was either withheld or the bleomycin dose was  reduced in 15% of the patients ,  mainly because of severe skin hyperpigmentation .
Disease status was evaluated by pelvic  examination and by appropriate radiologic and laboratory investigations .
Blood  counts were performed weekly and the lowest granulocyte and platelet counts recorded .
Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method21 and was measured from day 1 of therapy until last  follow-up or death .
Actuarial survival curves were compared by the log-rank method .
RESULTS .
The median follow-up time for the RT arm is 51 months (range ,  34 to 67) and is 44 months  (range ,  35 to 65) for the CT + RT .
In Table 4 ,  we show the number of patients still alive in spite of their disease being classified as PR  at the end of treatment .
The overall 5-year actuarial  survival for the two groups is shown in Fig 1 .
Median survivals were 25 months in the RT arm and 10.5 months in the CT + RT .
The 5-year  survival rates for the complete responders were 57% and 36% for the RT and CT + RT groups ,  respectively .
There was also no  difference in the incidence of distant disease between RT and CT + RT (20% v18.5%) .
A more detailed  description of the pulmonary toxicity has been the subject of another report.' .
Diarrhea was the main complication of pelvic  irradiation ,  seen in eight patients (15.5%) on RT and 11 (34%) on CT + RT .
DISCUSSION .
Although 25.5% of the patients achieved a CR following three cycles of BOMP and 47% of the CT + RT group obtained a CR at the  end of RT ,  the 5-year overall survival was significantly inferior in the CT + RT group than in the control arm (39% v 21% ,  P  = .02) .
The reason for this surprising and disturbing finding is not entirely clear .
This may explain why in spite of a satisfactory rate of response following neoadjuvant CT ,  there was no  improvement in local tumor control ,  and survival was adversely affected .
Withers et a1 have suggested  that the accelerated repopulationlate in the treatment involves only a small number of surviving cells ,  and rapid  repopulation would not be detectable as a change in volume of the total tumor mass .
Thus ,  a PR or even a CR could therefore  be of questionable value in determining therapeutic effectiveness ,  as tumor masses would be still regressing while the  subclinical clonogenic cell repopulation is accelerating .
The mechanisms by which this increased cell proliferation occurs  are not entirely clear ,  although ,  as suggested by Tannock , 34 it may result from improved nutrition of surviving cells  following shrinkage of the tumor due to previous therapy .
Another possible explanatory mechanism for our poorer results with the combined treatment modality may be the development of  cross resistance between radiation and certain antineoplastic agents .
In this study ,  27% of the patients (14 of 52) in  the RT group were called partial responders at the end of irradiation .
However ,   until such procedures prove to be definitive and precise ,  the use of response to therapy as a predictor of outcome should be  abandoned as an end point in phase III trials .
None of the patients who  experienceddrug-induced pulmonary toxicity had any of the well-known risk factors for development of bleomycin lung toxicity .
At present ,  there is no evidence to support the use of upfront CT before pelvic irradiation in stage III B cervical cancer .
