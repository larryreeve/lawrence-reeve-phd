Patients were randomly assigned no adjuvant treatment (control group) or an immediate postoperative intraportal infusion of 500mg/m fluorouracil plus 5000 units heparin in 1 L 5% glucose per 24 h for 7 consecutive days (days 1-7) plus 10 mg/m mitomycin in a single dose on day 1 .
To be eligible ,  patients had to have no evidence of metastatic disease in preoperative investigations. 29 patients had liver metastases diagnosed at resection and 8 had incomplete resection .
The 37 patients who had metastases diagnosed at surgery or had incomplete resection were regarded as having relapsed on the day of surgery. 5 patients were lost to follow-up .
In 41 patients (17-4%) treatment was assigned but not given because of surgery-related problems (7) ,  difficulties with catheter placement (7) ,  other technical problems (14) ,  patient refusal (2) ,  and various other reasons (11) .
The group assigned perioperative portal chemotherapy had significantly higher 5-year disease-free survival than the control group (table 2) .
At median follow-up of 96 months ,  235 patients had died ,  108 in the infusion group and 127 in the control group. 5-year overall survival was also higher in the infusion group (table 2) .
The infusion group had fewer local recurrences and liver metastases with or without relapses at other sites than the control group (table 4) .
The 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 1-9% (10/533 patients)-2.3% (6/266) in the control group and 1.5% (4/267) in the infusion group. 1 patient in each group died of myocardial infarction ,  2 patients in the control group died of refractory small-bowel obstruction ,  and 3 patients in each group died of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative septicaemia .
Transient leucopenia (<3 X10 white blood cells per L) developed in 6 patients during adjuvant chemotherapy ,  and the white-blood-cell count was significantly lower on postoperative days 7 and 10 in the infusion group than in the control group .
This trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase survival in patients with colorectal cancer .
After median follow-up of 8 years we were notable to confirm the overall reduction of liver metastases reported by Taylor et al. We did find ,  however ,  a consistent reduction of all kinds of tumour recurrences that resulted in a significant advantage in overall survival and disease-free survival for patients  treated with adjuvant portal infusion ,  confirming previous findings .
Previous investigations ,  with the exception of one ,  have shown improvements in overall and disease-free survival  and a reduction in the frequency of liver recurrences ,  especially in the subgroups of colon  cancer patients and of those with tumour-involved regional lymph nodes (Dukes C) .
Two as yet unpublished meta-analyses of all randomised trials comparing portal adjuvant chemotherapy with a no-treatment control group have been conducted by the European Organization on Research and Treatment of Cancer and the Oxford Colorectal Cancer Cooperative Group .
Both analyses are based on data for more than 3000 patients ,  the results show a  statistically significant overall and disease-free survival advantage for patients who received portal adjuvant therapy .
However ,  none of the studies couldc onfirm the statistically significant overall effect on the frequency of liver metastases  reported by Taylor et al. It seems likely that the effect of adjuvant portal chemotherapy on overall and disease-free survival can be attributed to the systemic effects of intraportal fluorouracil ,  which lead to a reduction in all tumour relapses (ie ,  local recurrences ,  liver metastases ,  and other distant metastases) .
Analyses of haematological toxic effects and postoperative complications show more side-effects in the systemic treatment group than in the portal or control groups .
Deaths attributable to portal adjuvant chemotherapy have been reported in at least three trials ,  1 in Taylor et al’s study due to perirectal sepsis ,  1 in Fielding and colleagues' study (a patient more than 80 years old) ,  and 1 in our trial (an insulin-dependent diabetic man who had gram-negative septicaemia and leucopenia during portal infusion) .
For further studies ,  we recommend that patients with insulin-dependent diabetes ,  a high risk of postoperative complications (obesity ,  cardiac ,  and/or pulmonary disease) ,  or any evidence of intra-abdominal sepsis at laparotomy or during the early postoperative period ,  should be excluded from participation .
Based on previous results and our own findings ,  the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research decided to accept perioperative adjuvant chemotherapy as the standard treatment for further clinical trials in colorectal cancer .
