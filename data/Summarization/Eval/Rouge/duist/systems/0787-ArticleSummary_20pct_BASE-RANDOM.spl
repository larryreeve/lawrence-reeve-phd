The importance of fixity was reflected in the survival pattern ,  5-year survival for fixed or partially fixed tumours was just 29% compared with 48% for mobile tumours .
In 1981 ,  the MRC began this trial of a higher dose of preoperative radiotherapy in patients with fixed or partially fixed tumours of the rectum who were thought to be suitable for abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection .
Eligible patients were men or women younger than 80 years who ,  had histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum partially or totally fixed within the pelvis with the lower margin of the tumour within 15 cm of the anal verge ,  were deemed suitable and fit for the proposed treatment and available for regular follow-up ,  were free of disseminated disease (confirmed by clinical and radiological examination) ,  and had had no previous malignant disease .
Two parallel opposed fields 18 cm by 15 cm were positioned to cover the tumour with an adequate proximal margin (normally 5 cm). 20 daily fractions of 2 Gy at the mid-plane central axis of the volume of the tumour were given over 4 weeks .
Survival times were not censored at 5 years ,  all surviving patients have been flagged on the OPCS central register ,  and were presumed alive on Jan 1 ,  1995 .
After 7 years of accrual ,  only slightly more than half the required number of patients had been entered .
Of the 279 patients ,  217 died .
A further five patients received slightly higher doses of radiation than planned to accommodate altered fractionation schedules .
Of patients who received radiotherapy ,  61 (45%) of 137 reported no significant morbidity. 45 (33%) of all patients suffered diarrhoea and 30 (22%) had skin reactions .
The distribution of type of surgery done was very similar in the two treatment groups (table 2) ,  with about half the patients in each group having abdominoperineal excision .
Three patients allocated surgery alone were considered unfit for surgery .
There was no evidence of an excess of complications in the radiotherapy group .
Complications associated with the colostomy were reported in ten surgery alone patients and eight radiotherapy patients ,  and five patients in each group had anastomosis-related complications after anterior restorative resection .
However ,  the data are compatible with a reduction in the risk of as much as a half or as little as 2% .
Survival free of distant recurrence is also shown in figure 2. 67 patients allocated surgery alone had a distant recurrence compared with 49 of those allocated radiotherapy .
Disease recurrence or death within 5 years occurred in 108 patients allocated surgery alone and 96 of those allocated radiotherapy .
Although less than two thirds of the planned sample size was achieved ,  217 (86%) of the 251 deaths anticipated ,  if the planned 450 patients had been entered and followed up for 3 years ,  have occurred .
Necropsy was done rarely and so causes of death should be interpreted with caution .
Fewer deaths were reported to have been from colorectal cancer or complications of the disease or its treatment among patients allocated preoperative radiotherapy than among those allocated surgery alone (85 vs 103 ,  hazard ratio 0.71 [0.54-0.97] ,  p=0.02) .
This estimate indicates a substantial decrease in the risk of death from colorectal cancer in patients allocated radiotherapy ,  although the data are compatible with a halving of the risk of death from colorectal cancer at one extreme or as little as 3% reduction in risk at the other .
Discussion .
Patients in this subgroup have a much lower potential for curative surgery as well as a much poorer rate of survival even when curative surgery appeared to have been achieved .
The case for preoperative adjuvant radiotherapy has been supported by several trials published since this trial started ,  including the European trial reported by Gerard and colleagues .
In that study of 466 patients ,  the survival benefit of 69% in the treated group versus 59% in the surgery-only group also failed to achieve statistical significance (log rank p=0.08) .
