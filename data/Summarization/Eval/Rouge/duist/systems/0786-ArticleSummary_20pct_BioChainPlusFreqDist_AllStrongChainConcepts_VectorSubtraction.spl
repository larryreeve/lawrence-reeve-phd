RECURRENCE OF rectal cancer in the pelvis after a complete resection represents a major contributor to morbidity and subsequent mortality .
An escalating single-agent 5-FU regimen incorporating a theoretical maximum-tolerated dose was chosen as the alternative treatment option based on clinical evidence suggesting a dose response curve for 5-FU and pilot data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggesting added efficacy of 5-FU when given at higher dose levels .
Patients considered eligible received a full explanation of the purpose ,  procedures ,  and risks of the study ,  signed a statement of informed consent approved by the local institutional review board ,  and were then randomized by telephoning a central coordinating center .
Supervoltage radiation therapy with the treatment volume to encompass the true and false pelvis was specified by the study protocol .
For all other patients ,  inclusion of the perineum in the radiation field was at the discretion of the investigator .
After this 5-week period ,  patients received one of the two chemotherapy schedules .
The first course on this treatment arm consisted of intravenous 5-FU 300 mg/m2  ,  days 1 to 5 and 375mg/m ,  days 36 to 40 given in a rapid infusion .
One dose of MeCCNU 100 mg/m was to be given orally on day 1 .
One year after study activation ,  treatment duration was decreased to a total of 12 months of treatment due to concerns about the leukemic potential of MeCCNU .
Treatment with 5-FU was to be continued at 5-week intervals .
Variations of field placement were also categorized into minor and major clinicaldeviations .
Patient Follow-Up .
Only the first site of recurrence was reported .
A major goal was to assess the contribution of MeCCNU to adjuvant benefit .
The potential for MeCCNU to contribute to a result superior to that obtained with escalating 5-FU can be assessed by examining the lower bound of the 95% confidence intervals of relative risk .
RESULTS .
The median age of the 199 patients analyzed was 59 years .
None of these differences were statistically significant .
The median follow-up time for the 108 surviving patients is 5.8 years with 3 years of follow-up available for all but five surviving patients .
Patients randomized to 5-FU and MeCCNU received a median total dose of MeCCNU of.37 g/m2 (25% < the planned level of .49 g/m) ,  and a median of .08 g/m of MeCCNU per 10-week course .
Approximately one third of patients (41 of 104) randomized to the escalating 5-FU arm were escalated to at least one 5-day course of 500 mg/m of 5-FU .
Dosimetry deviations were limited to 5% of the cases .
Toxicity .
One event occurred in a 50-year old man assigned to receive escalating 5-FU .
The probability of 3-year disease-free survival on the two arms is 54% and 68% for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and the escalating 5-FU arm ,  respectively ,  median time to recurrenceis estimated to be 4 years and greater than 4 years ,  respectively (Fig 1) .
After adjustment for these variables ,  the 5-FU and MeCCNU and the escalating 5-FU treatment results remained statistically indistinguishable (P = .30 , two-tailed) .
Mortality .
A total of 91 deaths have been reported ,  46% (44 of95) on 5-FU and MeCCNU and 45% (47 of 104) on 5-FU .
The one death with no cause reported was on the escalating 5-FU arm .
Median survival has not been reached in either treatment arm .
There were no differences between the radiation and escalating 5-FU arm of GI7180 and the radiation and 5-FU and MeCCNU arm of GI 7175 with respect to survival within any stage (Fig 4) .
DISCUSSION .
In any adjuvant study ,  toxicity of therapy must be carefully assessed .
The risk to the patient ,  however ,  is balanced by the expected survival benefit .
Progress has clearly been made in the adjuvant treatment of rectal cancer .
The protocol-mandated radiotherapy dose (4140 cGy) may be suboptimal .
Therefore ,  we conclude that MeCCNU is not an essential component of effective postoperative combined modality treatment of adjuvant rectal cancer and should not be included in future treatment regimens .
