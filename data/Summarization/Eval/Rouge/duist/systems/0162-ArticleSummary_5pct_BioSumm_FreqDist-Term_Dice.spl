In fact ,  the retrospective evaluation of roentgenograms revealed the presence of distant metastases prior to radical mastectomy in 3 patients (CMF 12 ,  1 ,  CMF 6 ,  2) ,  while 4 additional women (CMF 12 ,  3 ,  CMF 6 ,  1) had fixation of the primary tumor to the underlying pectoral fascia or muscle (T3b) .
However ,  in spite of the fact that frequency of objective remission was superimposable (-30%) in both ER groups regardless of treatment administered and site(s) of first involvement ,  the disease in ER + tumors had amore indolent course ,  while ER - tumors showed further progression within a few months .
In one patient of the 6-cycle group ,  endometrial carcinoma in situ was documented within 16 mo from mastectomy ,  3 patients in the 12-cycle group developed endometrial carcinoma ,  thyroid cancer ,  and myoblastoma ,  respectively ,  and in all patients second neoplasms were diagnosed between 46 and 49 mo from mastectomy .
It appears evident that ,  (A) the two series given 12 cycles of CMF achieved the same results ,  (B) the data reported in the three series treated with CMF are almost equivalent ,  (C) adjuvant CMF ,  whether administered for 12 or 6 cycles ,  was able to alter the course of operable breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes compared to the group subjected to radical mastectomy alone .
More recently ,  the Guy's Hospital and Manchester study groups reported the actuarial 5-yr RFS of a randomized study comparing radical mastectomy alone versus melphalan versus CMF and showed that the only group significantly improved by adjuvant CMF was that of postmenopausal women ,  while premenopausal patients had findings that were superimposable in all three treatment groups .
Patterns of first treatment failure were not different in the two series and ,  regardless of treatment instituted upon relapse ,  frequency of objective remissions were similar between the two groups followed by short-lived remissions in ER - tumors ,  while ER + tumors tended to show slow growing disease .
The reason(s) why RFS was not improved by prolonging chemotherapy once pathologic complete remission has been achieved ,  in our own trial and in other adjuvant trials for breast cancer ,  as well as in a variety of neoplastic diseases ,  can now be interpreted by considering the problem of specifically multidrug-resistant phenotypes .
Only long-term analysis will answer the questions of whether the addition of adjuvant hormone therapy to chemotherapy will improve the results in ER + tumors and whether the excellent results reported by the M D Anderson Hospital with FAC (fluorouracil ,  adriamycin ,  cyclophosphamide) in women with > 4 axillary nodes 7 will be reproducible .
At present ,  tumor cell burden in the axilla appears to consistently represent an important prognostic factor ,  even in the presence of full dose chemotherapy ,  while new prospective trials should explore the potential efficacy of multiple non-cross-resistant drug combinations delivered for a relatively short time .
