Of these ,  the method that has proven successful in most situations and in the hands of most surgeons has been the two-layer anastomosis using interrupted silk sutures for an outer inverted seromuscular layer and a running absorbable suture for a transmural inner layer .
Each stitch was advanced approximately 5 mm. To avoid ischemia of the anastomosis ,  the surgeon had to ensure that only enough pressure was applied to the suture while following to approximate the ends of the bowel and render the anastomosis watertight .
Of the three patients in whom fistulas developed ,  one patient had abdominal carcinomatosis ,  one had diffuse peritonitis from an iatrogenic injury of the cecum that occurred during a radical resection of a gynecologic malignancy ,  and the third patient had been treated with an abbreviated laparotomy for trauma and was undergoing a planned reoperation .
The two-layer interrupted anastomosis has its origins in the early 19th century through the experimental work of Travers and of Lembert ,  who advocated careful approximation of the serosal surfaces of the bowel and devised a method of suturing to accomplish this .
Although it is certainly possible to create an ischemic continuous anastomosis by applying too much tension while following the suture ,  Hautefeuille has argued that this is easier to avoid with a continuous suture because there is no point in the anastomosis where the bowel is completely devoid of its blood supply .
