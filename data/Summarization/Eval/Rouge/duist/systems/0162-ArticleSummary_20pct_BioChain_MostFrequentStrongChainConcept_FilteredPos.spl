SINCE JUNE 1973 ,  the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of CMF (cyclophosphamide ,  methotrexate ,  and fluorouracil) chemotherapy were evaluated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes .
After radical mastectomy ,  eligible patients were prospectively randomized to receive either no further treatment or 12 monthly cycles of adjuvant CMF .
These results ,  as well as those reported in similar studies ,  suggest that the multimodality approach with cyclical combination chemotherapy is indeed an important advance in the strategy of primary management of resectable breast cancer ,  and therefore it is worthy of more widespread consideration .
In fact ,  a relative shortterm adjuvant systemic treatment would spare the patients a considerable amount of toxicity .
The preliminary 3-yr results have shown that in premenopausal women ,  6 cycles of CMF yielded results that were identical to those obtained with 12 cycles .
This article presents the 5-yr results achieved in our study .
Study Design and Treatment Schedule .
No postoperative radiotherapy or any other ancillary treatment was given .
The dose of all three drugs was reduced by 50% when the leukocyte count ranged from 3900 to 2500/cu mm or the platelet count from 99,000 to 75,000/cu mm. In the presence of more severe myelosuppression ,  treatment was delayed until at least half of the dose could be administered .
At first relapse ,  treatment was uniform for both groups of women .
The following systemic treatment was mainly utilized ,  patients in whom estrogen receptors were positive were subjected to hormonal manipulations (ovariectomy in premenopausal women and additive hormonal therapy ,  particularly tamoxifen ,  in postmenopausal patients) ,  combined sometimes with chemotherapy .
When estrogen receptors were negative or could not be determined ,  systemic treatment consisted of combination chemotherapy utilizing preferentially an adriamycin- containing regimen .
RESULTS .
Results as Function of Treatment Programs .
Table 1 details the results according to menopausal and nodal status .
It appears evident that treatment regimens were unable to significantly affect the RFS within each patient subset .
The somewhat contrasting results observed in the 6-cycle group in pre- and postmenopausal patients with 1-3 nodes (80.3% versus 66.1%) again reflect only a fictitious difference (SE ,  4.1 and 8.1 ,  respectively) .
On the contrary ,  in both treatmentand menopausal groups ,  RFS was affected by the number of involved nodes (Table 1) .
Figure 2 shows the 5-yr total survival .
In fact ,  premenopausal patients in the 12-cycle group had a 72% 5-yr survival compared to 77.1% for women in the 6-cycle group (p = 0.20) .
Results as Function of ER status .
Regardless of the type of treatment ,  RFS and overall survival were correlated with the presence (ER +) or absence (ER -) of estrogen receptors in the primary tumor .
Also ,  no difference was evident when overall survival of postmenopausal women was examined (ER+ 82.5% versus ER- 76.2% ,  p =0.32) .
By contrast ,  premenopausal women with ER + tumors had a significantly longer survival than their matches with ER- tumors (79.9% versus 67.6% ,  p = 0.03) .
Results as Function of Dose Levels of CMF .
The 5-yr results of the present study are now sufficiently mature to indicate with confidence that 6 cycles of CMF are equivalent to 12 cycles in terms of RFS and total survival .
The observation that in some patient subsets 6 cycles of CMF yielded apparently superior results to 12 cycles is probably related to the relative number of patients in each group and to the different median follow-up in postmenopausal women  whose accrual was discontinued in December 1976 .
Besides RFS and survival ,  other findings would support evidence that 6 cycles of CMF are as effective as 12 cycles .
Thus ,  all above reported findings strongly support our preliminary 3-yr results and indicate that utilizing a single multidrug regimen ,  it is possible to reduce the duration of adjuvant treatment in operable breast cancer without compromising the therapeutic results .
Present results are in line with those reported in a similar study carried out at the Sidney Farber Cancer Institute .
Henderson et al.15 reported that at 6 yr of follow-up (median 2.6 yr) ,  no RFS or survival difference was evident between the two groups .
The 5-yr results achieved in the first study are reported in Table 6 and compared with those obtained in the present series .
It appears evident that ,  (A) the two series given 12 cycles of CMF achieved the same results ,  (B) the data reported in the three series treated with CMF are almost equivalent ,  (C) adjuvant CMF ,  whether administered for 12 or 6 cycles ,  was able to alter the course of operable breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes compared to the group subjected to radical mastectomy alone .
We had previously reported4 that the different results observed in our first adjuvant program were probably due to the low-dose CMF started in 31 of 104 postmenopausal patients (30%) because of elderly age .
Only long-term analysis will answer the questions of whether the addition of adjuvant hormone therapy to chemotherapy will improve the results in ER + tumors and whether the excellent results reported by the M D Anderson Hospital with FAC (fluorouracil ,  adriamycin ,  cyclophosphamide) in women with > 4 axillary nodes 7 will be reproducible .
