Adjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma is controversial because previous trials reported conflicting results .
Patients between 18 and 65 years of age with grade 3 to 4 spindle-cell sarcomas (primary diameter >= 5 cm or any size recurrent tumor) in extremities or girdles were eligible .
Therefore ,  our data favor an intensified treatment in similar cases .
Although cure is still difficult to achieve ,  a significant delay in death is worthwhile ,  also considering the short duration of treatment and the absence of toxic deaths .
However ,  the vast majorities arise from the extra-osseous and subcutaneous soft tissue of the limbs .
Not one new study has been already reported ,  whereas the present Italian co-operative study closed patient accrual in November 1996 because of the results of the planned interim analysis .
Here we report the results of the Italian co-operative study after a median follow-up of 59 months and a minimum time between randomization and date last seen of 28 months among patients who did not die .
All the patients gave their informed written consent before the randomization .
Radical surgery consisted of amputation in case of massive involvement of critical structures or compartmental resection in highly selected patients .
Chemotherapy ,  repeated every 3 weeks ,  consisted of five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin (EPI) 60 mg/m2/die ,  in a short intravenous (IV) infusion on days 1 and 2 (total dose per cycle ,  120 mg/m2) ,  IFO 1.8 g/m2/die diluted in 500 mL of normal saline and administered over 1 hour on days 1 through 5 (total dose per cycle ,  9 g/m2) ,  and 6-mercapto-ethansulfonate in a bolus IV injection at 20% of the IFO dose ,  given before and 4 and 8 hours after the IFO infusions .
Hydration (1,500 to 2,000 mL of fluids IV after chemotherapy) ,  antiemetics (5-hydroxytryptamine-3 antagonists) ,  and filgrastim (300 fig/d SC ,  days 8 through 15) were routinely administered .
Physical examinations ,  routine chemistry ,  and x-ray of the thorax and bones underlying the primary site were performed every 2 months and a CT scan of the thorax was performed every 6 months for the first 2 years .
All centers faxed protocol-specific eligibility checklists to the statistics office in Aviano ,  patients were stratified using a four-block stratification by primary tumor (diameter < 10 cm v >= 10 cm) and recurrent tumor (diameter < 10 cm v >= 10 cm) and randomized to treatment or control groups .
The checklist with the allocated groups was sent back to the responsible physician .
At first observation ,  the range of the tumor diameters seems to be different between the two treatment groups .
The remaining 68 patients (65%) were treated using a limb-sparing procedure involving radiation therapy and surgery ,  45 underwent surgery and postoperative radiation therapy ,  and 24 underwent preoperative radiation therapy and conservative surgery (Table 1) .
Of the 46 patients that started chemotherapy ,  four did not complete the treatment .
In 8% of these cases ,  the delay was between 7 and 14 days ,  thus representing the real recovery time from previous toxicity .
All deaths except one (in the control arm) were disease related .
Additional relapses at the same site after an adequate treatment are not reported .
Patients in the treated arm experienced a 41% reduction in the risk of disease relapse (HR ,  0.59 ,  95% CI ,  0.36 to 0.99 ,  P = .04) (Fig 2) .
Overall ,  13 patients had a local recurrence of disease as the first relapse without simultaneous distant metastases (four patients in the treatment arm and nine patients in the control arm ,  Table 4) .
(Fig 3) .
Metastasis-Free Survival .
The estimated cumulative incidence function at 2 years was 28% for the control arm and 45% for the treatment arm (P = .08) ,  at 4 years it was 44% and 45% ,  respectively (P = .94) .
There were a total of 48 deaths ,  20 in the treated group and 28 in the control group ,  forty-seven deaths were disease related .
Patients died from uncontrolled metastatic disease .
The median survival time was higher among patients who underwent adjuvant therapy (75 months) ,  compared with untreated patients (46 months) (Fig 4) .
DISCUSSION .
In fact ,  disease stages ,  tumor sizes ,  and grading varied greatly.23 Second ,  eight studies made use of a polychemotherapy including an anthracycline ,  vincristine ,  cyclophosphamide ,  and dacarbazine ,  but only the first is active in soft tissue sarcomas ,  the others probably increased toxicity .
Although these first-generation trials are no longer the gold standards ,  the meta-analysis did reveal a number of elements that suggested a positive role of adjuvant chemotherapy .
The serial hematologic evaluations made during the median follow-up of 3 years confirmed the complete recovery of hematopoietic functions .
The absolute benefit deriving from treatment was a 19% reduction in death at 4 years (P = .04) (Table 5) .
However ,  only high-risk patients were selected for this study .
This unfavorable local behaviour is mainly because of the dimension of local disease ,  in our opinion .
However ,  between the three different local approaches there was a trend in favor of preoperative radiation therapy (two local relapse of 24 patients in the control arm ,  8.3%) .
Time is a crucial issue in oncology and in the development of metastatic disease from high-risk soft tissue sarcomas .
Although a few second-generation trials are still going on ,  this study is the first to be concluded (November 1996) ,  having stopped the patient accrual according to a predefined statistical methodology .
Nevertheless ,  a significant delay in relapse and death ,  as observed in our treatment group ,  is worthwhile and cost-effective in young patients ,  also taking into account the shortness of the treatment and the absence of toxic death .
