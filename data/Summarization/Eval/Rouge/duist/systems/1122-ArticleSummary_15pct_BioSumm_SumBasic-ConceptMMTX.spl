Whole pelvic postoperative radiation therapy has been found to possibly decrease the incidence of local/regional recurrence with little or no effect on overall survival .
This report summarizes the preliminary results of the trial which closed to patient accrual in June 1994 .
Patients with clinical Stage IB–IIA cancer of the uterine cervix treated by radical hysterectomy ,  bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy ,  and aortic lymph node sampling were eligible for entry into this prospective study if they had one or more of the following risk factors ,  (1) metastatic disease to pelvic lymph nodes ,  (2) large primary tumors greater than or equal to 4 cm in diameter ,  (3) deeply invasive lesions with 75% or greater stromal invasion ,  (4) nonsquamous histology ,  and/or (5) occult parametrial involvement or positive surgical margins .
In the second arm of the study ,  patients were randomized to treatment with a similar regimen of chemotherapy as described above without pelvic radiation ,  following the first two cycles of cisplatin and bleomycin ,  the patient then received the third and fourth treatment of cisplatin alone at 3-to 4-week intervals .
Additional entry criteria included histologic confirmation of negative para-aortic lymph nodes ,  normal renal function (creatinine clearance of greater than 60 ml/min) ,  normal liver function tests ,  hemoglobin of greater than 8.0 g/dl ,  and a normal DLCO pulmonary function test .
Forty-five patients were randomized to the chemotherapy withdrawn by the institutional principal investigator due to plus radiation therapy treatment arm and 44 patients received poor medical condition of the patient (n ? 1) .
There were 12 major protocol viola-patients received only a portion of the proscribed treatment ,  tions ,  including 7 patients who were randomized (6 to che-one patient ,  randomized to chemotherapy ,  withdrew after chemotherapy plus radiation therapy and 1 patient to chemother-experiencing an allergic bleomycin reaction during the initial chemotherapy alone) and then either refused treatment (n ?6) or were infusion of bleomycin during cycle 1 .
Four patients randomized to chemotherapy plus radiation refused either the radia-to follow-up or had no follow-up data available for analysis.  tion therapy (n ?3) or had a major violation in the radiation Thus ,  there were 33 patients who received the combination therapy treatment plan when intravaginal radiation therapy of chemotherapy and pelvic radiation and 39 who received was administered ,  and she did not receive the last 2 cycles chemotherapy alone who could be evaluated for disease-of cisplatin (n ?1). free and overall survival .

Major toxicity suggest that a 65% 5-year survival rate after therapy combinincluded one patient who did not receive the second cycle ing radical hysterectomy ,  pelvic lymphadenectomy ,  and of bleomycin due to the onset of pulmonary symptoms and postoperative pelvic radiotherapy for patients with pelvic a significant decrease in pulmonary function compared to a lymph node metastases is an improvement compared to his-pretreatment study .
The advantages of eliminating the radiation therapy component of postoperative therapy are apparent in that the duration of treatment is shorter ,  costs are reduced ,  and the long-term side effects of pelvic radiotherapy after radical pelvic surgery are eliminated .
Investigators who design adjuvant trials for patients at high risk for recurrence after radical hysterectomy for invasive cervical cancer must balance the potential benefit to be gained by a minority of patients against the risks inherent in treating all patients .
