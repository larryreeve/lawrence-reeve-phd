SINCE JUNE 1973 ,  the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of CMF (cyclophosphamide ,  methotrexate ,  and fluorouracil) chemotherapy were evaluated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes .
Similar findings were reported in the 4-yr analysis for the total patient population .
MATERIALS AND METHODS .
Study Design and Treatment Schedule .
All patients were subjected to either Halsted or modified radical mastectomy ,  but a small fraction (16%) was subjected to extended radical mastectomy .
Adjuvant chemotherapy was started within 2-4 wk from mastectomy .
At first relapse ,  treatment was uniform for both groups of women .
Patient Population .
All these patients were considered evaluable .
Study Parameters .
Statistical Evaluation .
RESULTS .
Results as Function of Treatment Programs .
In postmenopausal women with more than 3 nodes ,  the difference between CMF 12 (34.4%) and CMF 6 (54.9% ,  p = 0.18) is only apparent since the confidence-limits throughout the curve totally blurred the percent difference (standard error ,  or SE ,  at 5 yr ,  8.4 and 11.3 ,  respectively) .
Figure 2 shows the 5-yr total survival .
Again ,  no difference was observed in the two treatment groups .
Site of First Relapse .
Results as Function of ER status .
By contrast ,  premenopausal women with ER + tumors had a significantly longer survival than their matches with ER- tumors (79.9% versus 67.6% ,  p = 0.03) .
At present ,  this difference is somewhat difficult to explain .
However ,  in spite of the fact that frequency of objective remission was superimposable (-30%) in both ER groups regardless of treatment administered and site(s) of first involvement ,  the disease in ER + tumors had amore indolent course ,  while ER - tumors showed further progression within a few months .
Results as Function of Dose Levels of CMF .
Early and Late Toxicity .
Acute toxic reactions have been previously reported .
Frequency of second tumors was similar in both treatment groups .
So far no patient has developed acute leukemia .
As can be seen ,  the relative frequency ranged between0.5% for the 6-cycle group and 1.7% for the control group of the previous series .
DISCUSSION .
In fact ,  confidence limits of the various series totally blurred the difference throughout the curves .
A long-term analysis would probably clarify this aspect .
Low-dose CMF was applied only in 12 of 83 (14%) of the present 12-cycle group and in 6 of 52 (12%) of the 6-cycle group .
Effective adjuvant combination chemotherapy seems to be unaffected by ER status ,  at least when RFS is considered .
Our results have been confirmed through different reports .
At present ,  we have no clear explanation for this difference .
This is an extremely important clinical observation .
