
   THE ROLE OF DOXORUBICIN (Adriamycin, Pharmacia & Upjohn, Inc, Kalamazoo, MI) for the treatment of
women with metastatic breast cancer is clearly established. It is the most active single agent for this
disease' and, when used in combination chemotherapy,has been shown to produce response rates that range
from 55% to 82%.2 It has been suggested that continuous treatment for advanced breast cancer compared
with intermittent treatment improves quality of life.
   Therefore, afterJanuary 14, 1991, patients who were randomized to either arm of the studies and had
received a cumulative dose of at least 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin subsequently received open-label DZR.
Drug Treatment Chemotherapy consisted of 500 mg/m2 fluorouracil, 50 mg/m2 doxorubicin, and 500 mg/m2
cyclophosphamide, which were administered intravenously (IV) on the first day of each treatment course
DZR or PLA, designated as the blinded study drug, was administered in a volume of 50 mL/m2 (10,1 ratio
of study drug to doxorubicin) by slow IV push or rapid-drip IV infusion. Treatment was repeated every
3 weeks, provided recovery from toxicity had occurred. In study 088001, the initial dose ratio of the
blinded study drug (DZR or PLA) to doxorubicin was 20,1 (DZR 1,000 mg/m2). During the first 9 months
of the study, six deaths occurred on the DZR arm of 088001, five deaths occurred on the DZR arm of a
parallel study (088002, a small-cell lung cancer study using a 20,1 dose). Throughout study 088006, the
dose ratio of study drug to doxorubicin was 10,1.
   Dose Modifications. A computer-based expert system was developed to ensure compliance with scheduled
evaluations and dose modifications. A computer-generated program calculated the patient's body-surface
area and recommended initial doses, dates for future treatments, and dose modifications or delays based
on the toxicity observed for each course Toxicity was graded using ECOG guidelines. 24 In addition, follow-up
tests were recommended at the appropriate times.
   Dose reductions due to hematologic toxicity were allowed for fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide, but
were not permitted for doxorubicin or DZR. Treatment was delayed for 7 days if on day 22 the granulocyte
count was less than 1.5 x 109/L or the platelet count less than 90 x 109/L. Dose reductions for other
toxicities were not permitted. A dose delay was defined as a period of at least 28 days since the previous
cycle of treatment. The studies had no predetermined cumulative dose for discontinuation of doxorublcin.
   Patients were removed from the study if they developed progressive disease, a cardiac event, or other
toxicity that precluded further treatment. There was no predetermined cumulative stopping dose of doxorubicin.The
case report forms of patients reported to have CHF on or off study by December 31, 1993 were independently
evaluated by a referee cardiologist who was blinded to the treatment arm the patient had received.
   The analyses presented in this report focus on 534 patients (349 on study 088001 and 185 on study
088006) who received the 10,1 dose ratio of DZR or PLA to doxorubicin and were randomized before January
14, 1991. The 53 patients on the PLA arm who were still receiving treatment on January 14, 1991 and crossed
over to open-label DZR were not censored after crossing over. For patients in the DZR and PLA groups,
the cumulative doxorubicin dose at cardiac event was plotted using Kaplan-Meier curves and the doses
were compared using the log-rank and generalized Wilcoxon tests. Patients who discontinued treatment
without experiencing any of the four cardiac events were censored at the cumulative dose received when
they went off treatment. The study was designed so that if the true HR of doxorubicin dose at cardiac
event was 3.0 in favor of the DZR group, the power to detect this difference would be .80 using a one-sided
log-rank test, setting the alpha level at .05. Objective response rates (CRs and PRs) were compared using
the Pearson X2 test in patients on the two arms with bidimensional measurable disease.
   The time to disease progression and survival were plotted using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared using
both the log-rank and the generalized Wilcoxon tests. The PLA and DZR groups were compared by stratifying
by study and using either the blocked Wilcoxon or Mantel-Haenszel test.
   Also included are the patients who received the 10,1 dose ratio (study drug to doxorubicin) randomized
before the amendment on January 14, 1991, and those randomized after that date.
   The analyses presented in this report include only the 534 patients who received the 10,1 dose ratio
randomized before January 14, 1991. This was to ensure a homogenous population of patients, since the
dose and design of the trial were changed during the course of the studies.
   Reasons for protocol violations included ineligibility for study entry (n = 8), study drug scheduling,
recording, or dosing problems (n = 18), ejection fraction changes that did not fulfill criteria for cardiac
event, but patient taken off study by investigator (n = 7), and an 8-week treatmentdelay (n = 1).
   Disease characteristics for these 534 patients randomized before January 14, 1991 and who received
a 10,1 dose on studies 088001 and 088006 are listed in Table 2.
   The log-rank test showed this difference between groups to be highly statistically significant (P
< .001), but the generalized Wilcoxon test indicated borderline significance (P = .068). The HR of PLA
to DZR in study 088001, adjusted for six cardiac risk covariables (age, diabetes mellitus, history ofcardiovascular
disease, hypertension, prior mediastinal irradiation, and LVEF within 10% of the institution's LLN),
was 2.84 (95% CI, 1.71 to 4.71, P < .001, Wald X2 test). The HR for study 088006, adjusted for these
six covariables, was 2.14 (95% CI, 1.06 to 4.33, P = .034, Wald X2 test). Response Rate Results of the
initial review of objective response rates (CRs and PRs) for patients with bidimensional measurable disease
demonstrated a significantly higher objective response rate in patients on study 088001 who received
PLA (63%) than in those who received DZR (48%) (P = .007, Pearson x2 test). All patients with measurable
disease who were enrolled onto studies 088001 and 088006 and who received a 10,1 dose are listed in Table
5.
   The difference between groups was not statistically significant according to either the log-rank or
the generalized Wilcoxon test (P = .27 andP = .45, respectively). This was the case when either the log-rank
or generalized Wilcoxon test was used. No statistically significant differences between groups were found
using either the log-rank or the generalized Wilcoxon test in study 088001 (P = .88 and P = .94) and
in study 088006 (P = .23 and P = .13).
   Dose Modification. When dose reductions and dose delays were analyzed separately, therewere still
no significant differences between arms.
