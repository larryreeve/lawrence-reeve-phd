although the superiority of combination radiotherapy and chemotherapy with fluorouracil 5 fu and semustine meccnu was clearly shown in terms of both disease free survival and subsequently overall survival the clinical impact of such treatment was tempered by the inclusion of meccnu in an adjuvant setting 
a two arm study was designed using the initial radiation chemotherapy program of the previous study gi 7175 for both arms of the new study gi 7180 but to offering meccnu to only half the patients during the postradiation period 
the same postradiation regimen of 5 fu and meccnu as that used in gi 7175 was chosen for one arm with the exception that the duration of treatment with postradiation 5 fu and meccnu was reduced from 18 months to 12 months in an attempt to reduce the leukemogenic potential of the meccnu 
an escalating single agent 5 fu regimen incorporating a theoretical maximum tolerated dose was chosen as the alternative treatment option based on clinical evidence suggesting a dose response curve for 5 fu and pilot data from the dana farber cancer institute suggesting added efficacy of 5 fu when given at higher dose levels 
patients were considered eligible for entry onto the study provided they had histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum and had undergone a surgical procedure at which time all gross tumor had been removed and no evidence of tumor had been present at the resection margins 
patients must have recovered from the acute effects of surgery been capable of starting treatment within 60 days after resection had no evidence of active infection had adequate performance and nutritional status to tolerate protocol treatment and had no preexisting or concurrent malignant tumors except basal cell or superficial squamous cell carcinomas of the skin 
presence of ascites peritoneal seeding residual pelvic tumor positive paraaortic lymph node biopsy or distant metastases excluded patients from study as did previous chemotherapy or pelvic irradiation or any active and significant coexistent disease that in the judgment of the investigator would make the risks of chemotherapy or radiation therapy prohibitive 
only patients with dukes pathologic stage b2 negative nodes disease extension into the perirectal fat c1 positive nodes no disease extension into the perirectal fat and c2 positive nodes disease extension into the perirectal fat were eligible and slides must have been available for review 
normal hepatic renal and bone marrow function ie bilirubin level 2 5 mg dl bun level 25 mg dl or creatinine level 1 5 mg dl leukocyte and platelet counts 4 500 ul and 125 000 ul respectively must have been documented before study entry 
patients considered eligible received a full explanation of the purpose procedures and risks of the study signed a statement of informed consent approved by the local institutional review board and were then randomized by telephoning a central coordinating center 
the superior border of the field was to be the top of the fifth lumbar vertebral body the lateral border 2 cm lateral to the true pelvic side wall and the inferior margin of the field was to be determined clinically 
second and subsequent courses were to be given on the same schedule but with the dose of 5 fu increased to 325 mg m intravenously days 1 to 5 375 mg m2 days 36 to 40 and meccnu to 130 mg m orally on day 1 
during postradiotherapy chemotherapy moderate or severe nausea or vomiting required a 50 dose reduction of all chemotherapy for one course mild stomatitis or diarrhea continued but not escalated therapy and moderate or worse stomatitis reduction of the next course of chemotherapy by 25 
repetition of severe marrow depression leukocyte count 1 500 ul or thrombocytopenia platelet count 25 000 ul after dose reduction or persistent leukopenia leukocyte count 4 000 ul or thrombocytopenia 100 000 ul at 10 weeks after the last dose of meccnu disqualified a patient from any further treatment with meccnu 
dose reduction criteria for the 5 fu escalating arm included no escalation if leukocyte count nadir was below 2 000 ul but at least 1 000 ul and platelet count nadir between 75 000 ul and 99 999 ul and a 25 reduction in the next course for leukocyte nadir below 1 000 ul and platelet count nadir below 75 000 ul 
the original design called for the enrollment of 134 patients per arm and the primary end point was to detect a difference in the 30 month disease free survival rate from 65 for the meccnu containing arm to 80 for the escalating 5 fu arm 
using the techniques of makuch and simon it can be shown that a sample size of 100 patients per arm has an 80 power to exclude differences in treatments as great as 19 assuming a 05 and a 30 month rate of 65 
although the protocol required treatment to begin within 60 days of surgery 20 patients evenly distributed between the two treatment arms began treatment more than 60 days postsurgery 16 of the 20 individuals received their initial therapy within 64 days 
the clinical characteristics were well balanced between the treatment arms with a slightly higher percentage of patients having disease extension into perirectal fat randomized to receive 5 fu and meccnu 61 compared with escalating 5 fu 56 and a higher percentage of males randomized to escalating 5 fu compared with 5 fu and meccnu 63 v 56 respectively 
although patients received a median total dose of 12 4 g m of 5 fu on the escalating 5 fu arm 25 the planned level of 16 5g m and 13 1 g m of 5 fu on the 5 fu and meccnu arm 23 the planned level of 16 9 g m the median monthly dose of 5 fu on the escalating arm was 1 74g m compared with 1 40 g m on the 5 fu and meccnu arm p 001 
patients randomized to 5 fu and meccnu received a median total dose of meccnu of 37 g m2 25 the planned level of 49 g m and a median of 08 g m of meccnu per 10 week course 
toxicities experienced by patients on the two arms are comparable 53 of patients on the 5 fu and meccnuarm 52 of 99 and 50 of those assigned to the escalating 5 fu arm 54 of 107 experienced at least one episode of severe or worse toxicity as defined by the gitsg toxicity scale 
the probability of 3 year disease free survival on the two arms is 54 and 68 for patients assigned to the 5 fu and meccnu arm and the escalating 5 fu arm respectively median time to recurrenceis estimated to be 4 years and greater than 4 years respectively fig 1 
when included in the cox model dukes stage resection type distance to the nearest margin 3 cm v other and the interaction between resection type and distance to the nearest margin were found to be significant without adjustment for multiple comparisons in predicting disease free survival p 05 
in fact the adjusted relative risk rr for tumor recurrence associated with the 5 fu and meccnu arm is 1 25 95 confidence interval ci 84 to 1 66 when considered individually without adjustment for covariates it is estimated to be 1 30 95 ci 87 to 1 94 
a secondary analysis of disease free survival considering all patients randomized regardless of eligibility status resulted in an estimated rr attributed to treatment with 5 fu and meccnu and adjusted for important covariates of 1 21 95 ci 83 to 1 88 
similarly when only eligible patients who received post radiation therapy drug treatment were considered 84 escalating 5 fu and 72 5 fu and meccnu patients no difference in direction or magnitude of the rr estimate was observed rr 1 17 95 ci 74 to 1 85 
eighty one of the deaths were attributed to progressive disease and one death was reported without documented cause the causes of death for the remaining nine patients were attributed to treatment two patients discussed above myocardial infarctions five three of whom had a suspected recurrence stroke one and metastatic disease resulting from a new primary tumor arising in the bile duct one 
figure 3 compares the survival prognosis of patients undergoing abdominal perineal resections and patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to margin of resection as determined by the pathologist on fresh specimen of 3 cm and greater than 3 cm patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to the margin greater than 3 cm experienced improved survival compared with patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to the nearest margin 3 cm suggesting that abdominal perineal resection should be considered when the distal margin for resection with the low anterior route would be 3 cm 
as in the disease free analysis secondary analyses of survival considering either all patients randomized or only patients who received treatment after the completion of radiation therapy resulted in no meaningful change in direction or magnitude of the rr attributed to treatment with the 5 fu and meccnu regimen rr 1 10 95 ci 72 to 1 67 and rr 1 04 95 ci 65 to 1 67 respectively 
a stage wise comparison of the results of this study with gi 7175 in which the same staging criteria of gi 7175 were applied to gi 7180 shows that reducing the chemotherapeutic regimen of 5 fu and meccnu from 18 months to 12 months did not significantly alter the survival outcome for patients 
the results of this study indicate that treatment after surgical resection of dukes b2 and c rectal cancer with escalating 5 fu postradiation therapy provides similar survival and recurrence outcomes as a postradiation chemotherapeutic regimen including the leukemogen meccnu 
results from the previous gitsg study gi 7175 of adjuvant therapy after surgical resection of dukes b2 or c rectal cancer demonstrated improved survival and disease free survival in patients treated with combination radiation therapy and post radiation therapy using 5 fu and meccnu when compared with surgery alone and improved disease free survival for patients treated with this combined modality therapy compared with radiation therapy alone 
the results of the present study confirm the expected survival and disease free survival probabilities observed in the combination therapy arm of the previous gitsg study while the recent report by the north central cancer treatment group ncctg further demonstrates the advantage of combination radiation therapy and chemotherapy compared with radiation therapy alone in reducing recurrence rates and improving survival 
although data from the initial rectal cancer adjuvant trial conducted by the national surgical breast and bowel project nsabp ro1 suggested improved survival and disease free survival in patients treated with chemotherapy alone compared with surgery alone that study did not include a combined modality treatment arm 
a recent national institutes of health consensus conference on adjuvant therapy for patients with colon and rectal cancer concluded that combined postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy improved local control and survival in stage b2 and c patients with rectal cancer and that treatment with combined modality therapy in these patients is recommended 
furthermore studies in metastatic colorectal disease demonstrating enhanced efficacy of 5 fu when administered with leucovorin as well as a recent report indicating a reduction in the rate of recurrence in colon cancer when levamisole was added to adjuvant 5 fu have led to an intergroup trial assessing the value of such combinations as adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer intergroup rectal adjuvant protocol int 0114 activated august 1990
