RECURRENCE OF rectal cancer in the pelvis after a complete resection represents a major contributor to morbidity and subsequent mortality. Preoperative and postoperative radiation therapy alone while reducing the local recurrence rate has not been shown to improve survival. In 1985 the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group GITSG study GI 7175 reported that postoperative radiation and chemotherapy reduced the tumor recurrence rate for patients who had undergone a curative resection for rectal adenocarcinoma. Although the superiority of combination radiotherapy and chemotherapy with fluorouracil5-FU and semustine MeCCNU was clearly shown in terms of both disease-free survival and subsequentlyoverall survival the clinical impact of such treatment was tempered by the inclusion of MeCCNU in an adjuvant setting. The leukemogenic effect of MeCCNU was established subsequent to the initiation of GI 7175 indeed one patient who participated in GI 7175 developed acute myeloid leukemia after MeCCNU therapy. A two-arm study was designed using the initial radiation/chemotherapy program of the previous study GI 7175 for both arms of the new study GI 7180 but to offering MeCCNU to only half the patients during the postradiation period. An escalating single-agent 5-FU regimen incorporating a theoretical maximum-tolerated dose was chosen as the alternative treatment option based on clinical evidence suggesting a dose response curve for 5-FU and pilot data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggesting added efficacy of 5-FU when given at higher dose levels. The first course of treatment for patients randomized to this arm consisted of 5-FU 350 mg/m intravenously given in a rapid infusion on days 1 to 5.  Dose reductions of 5-FU by 25 were required for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU treatment arm who experienced a leukocyte count nadir of below 2000/UL during the first 3 weeks. Dose reduction criteria for the 5-FU escalating arm included no escalation if leukocyte count nadir was below 2000/UL but at least 1000/UL and platelet count nadir between 75000/UL and 99999/UL and a 25 reduction in the next course for leukocyte nadir below 1000/UL and platelet count nadir below 75000/UL. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an adjuvant treatment with radiation therapy and escalating 5-FU and to compare it with a combination of 5-FU and MeCCNU. The original design called for the enrollment of 134 patients per arm and the primary end point was to detect a difference in the 30-month disease-free survival rate from .65 for the MeCCNU-containing arm to .80 for the escalating 5-FU arm. Between March 1981 and November 1985 210 patients were enrolled in this study 101 were randomized to the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen and 109 to the escalating 5-FU arm. Eleven patients six receiving 5-FUand MeCCNU and five receiving escalating 5-FU comprising 5 of the registered population are not included in the primary analysis as they were determined to be ineligible by an independent review. Of the 199 patients who comprised the cohort for primary analysis 95 were randomized to receive postradiation 5-FU and MeCCNU and 104 were randomized to receive postradiation escalating 5-FU. Two patients on each treatment arm received no adjuvant therapy and 16 patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and 18 patients assigned to the escalating 5-FU regimen received no postradiation chemotherapy. An additional three patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm received no MeCCNU after radiation therapy but continued to receive 5-FU. As planned in the protocol design patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm were treated for a longer duration than patients who received escalating 5-FU median 11.3 months v 7.5 months respectively. Also as planned among patients who received chemotherapy dose intensity of 5-FU was greater on the escalating 5-FU arm versus the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm. Approximately one third of patients 41 of 104 randomized to the escalating 5-FU arm were escalated to at least one 5-day course of 500 mg/m of 5-FU. Life-threatening toxicities were reported in six 6 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 11 10 escalating 5-FU patients. Leukocyte depression below 1000/UL accounted for a majority of these episodes eight patients on the escalating 5-FU arm and three on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm. Toxicity resulted in either a temporary or permanent decrease in dose interruption of part of therapy or interruption of all therapy in 62 of 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 53 of escalating 5-FU patients. Six patients are reported to have experienced severe three or life-threatening three treatment-related intestinal obstructions two receiving the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen and four on escalating 5-FU Table 2. Disease recurrence has been documented in 48 of eligible patients including 54 51 of 95 of patient srandomized to receive 5-FU and MeCCNU and 43 45of 104 of patients randomized to receive escalating 5-FU Table 3. Recurrences involving local sites occurred in 17 of 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 16 of escalating 5-FU patients. Significantly P .05 more recurrences involving distant sites have been documented on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm 40 compared with the escalating 5-FU arm 26. The probability of 3-year disease-free survival on the two arms is 54 and 68 for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and the escalating 5-FU arm respectively median time to recurrenceis estimated to be 4 years and greater than 4 years respectively Fig 1. After adjustment for these variables the 5-FU and MeCCNU and the escalating 5-FU treatment results remained statistically indistinguishable P .30two-tailed. Similarly when only eligible patients who received post-radiation therapy drug treatment were considered 84 escalating 5-FU and 72 5-FU and MeCCNU patients no difference in direction or magnitude of the RR estimate was observed RR 1.17 95 CI .74 to 1.85.
