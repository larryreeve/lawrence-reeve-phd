5-FU and MeCCNU. Escalating 5-FU. Dose Reduction Criteria.

Dose reductions of 5-FU by 25% were required for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU treatment arm who experienced a leukocyte count nadir of below 2,000/UL during the first 3 weeks. Treatment with 5-FU was to be continued at 5-week intervals. Patient Follow-Up.

When estimating disease-free survival, patients were censored if they were disease-free at last contact (or died free of disease). RESULTS.

Patient Cohort.

Between March 1981 and November 1985, 210 patients were enrolled in this study; 101 were randomized to the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen, and 109 to the escalating 5-FU arm. Patient Characteristics.

The clinical characteristics were well balanced between the treatment arms, with a slightly higher percentage of patients having disease extension into perirectal fat randomized to receive 5-FU and MeCCNU (61%) compared with escalating 5-FU (56%), and a higher percentage of males randomized to escalating 5-FU compared with 5-FU and MeCCNU (63% v 56%,respectively). Treatment Administration.

Two patients on each treatment arm received no adjuvant therapy, and 16 patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and 18 patients assigned to the escalating 5-FU regimen received no postradiation chemotherapy. An additional three patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm received no MeCCNU after radiation therapy but continued to receive 5-FU. As planned in the protocol design, patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm were treated for a longer duration than patients who received escalating 5-FU (median, 11.3 months v 7.5 months, respectively). Also as planned, among patients who received chemotherapy, dose intensity of 5-FU was greater on the escalating 5-FU arm versus the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm. Although patients received a median total dose of 12.4 g/m of 5-FU on the escalating 5-FU arm (25% < the planned level of 16.5g/m) and 13.1 g/m of 5-FU on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm (23% < the planned level of 16.9 g/m), the median monthly dose of 5-FU on the escalating arm was 1.74g/m, compared with 1.40 g/m on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm (P < .001). Approximately one third of patients (41 of 104) randomized to the escalating 5-FU arm were escalated to at least one 5-day course of 500 mg/m of 5-FU.

Life-threatening toxicities were reported in six (6%) 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 11 (10%) escalating 5-FU patients. Leukocyte depression below 1,000/UL accounted for a majority of these episodes (eight patients on the escalating 5-FU arm and three on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm). Platelet count depression below 20,000/UL was reported for two patients receiving 5-FU and MeCCNU. Toxicity resulted in either a temporary or permanent decrease in dose, interruption of part of therapy, or interruption of all therapy in 62% of 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 53% of escalating 5-FU patients. Permanent interruption of all therapy due to toxicity occurred in 11% of 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 14% of escalating5-FU patients.

Two treatment-related deaths were reported, one on each treatment arm. The patient died of septicemia and pneumonia 24 days after treatment initiation. At the time of death the patient's leukocyte count was below 500/UL. One patient developed intestinal obstruction during the radiation therapy.

Disease Recurrence.

Disease recurrence has been documented in 48% of eligible patients including 54% (51 of 95) of patient srandomized to receive 5-FU and MeCCNU and 43% (45of 104) of patients randomized to receive escalating 5-FU (Table 3). Recurrences involving local sites occurred in 17% of 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 16% of escalating 5-FU patients. Significantly (P = .05) more recurrences involving distant sites have been documented on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm (40%) compared with the escalating 5-FU arm (26%). After adjustment for these variables, the 5-FU and MeCCNU and the escalating 5-FU treatment results remained statistically indistinguishable (P = .30,two-tailed). Similarly, when only eligible patients who received post-radiation therapy drug treatment were considered (84 escalating 5-FU and 72 5-FU and MeCCNU patients), no difference in direction or magnitude of the RR estimate was observed (RR = 1.17; 95% CI, .74 to 1.85).


Six of the deaths unrelated to disease occurred in patients receiving escalating 5-FU and three in patients receiving 5-FU and MeCCNU. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 3-year survival probabilities for patients assigned to 5-FU and MeCCNU and escalating 5-FU are 66% and 75%, respectively (Fig 2). Median survival has not been reached in either treatment arm.

There were no differences between the radiation and escalating 5-FU arm of GI7180 and the radiation and 5-FU and MeCCNU arm of GI 7175 with respect to survival within any stage (Fig 4).


Both survival and disease-free survival results favor the escalating 5-FU arm, although these differences did not reach statistical significance. Fewer recurrences involving distant sites occurred on the escalating 5-FU arm compared with the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm, further suggesting that MeCCNU is not an essential component of the postradiation chemotherapy treatment. Because of toxicity, patients often received no therapy beyond the initial radiation treatment. To date, no patient treated with 5-FU and MeCCNU in this study has developed leukemia.

Results from the previous GITSG study (GI 7175) of adjuvant therapy after surgical resection of Dukes B2 or C rectal cancer demonstrated improved survival and disease-free survival in patients treated with combination radiation therapy and post radiation therapy using 5-FU and MeCCNU when compared with surgery alone, and improved disease-free survival for patients treated with this combined modality therapy compared with radiation therapy alone. It appears highly unlikely that further follow-up in GI 7180 will result in 5-FU and MeCCNU treatment being superior to escalating 5-FU.
