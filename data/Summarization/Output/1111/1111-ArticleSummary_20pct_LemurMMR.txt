stage i cervical cancer has a relatively favorable prognosis with an 80 cure rate achieved with radical hysterectomy or radiotherapy 
in 1988 the gog initiated a prospective randomized study gog 92 reported here to investigate the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy for stage i cervical cancer patients treated by conventional radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who were at high risk for recurrence because of ltd dsi cls but excluding patients with lymph node metastases 
chung et al reported that cervical cancer larger than 4 cm in diameter determined by preoperative palpation was associated with a 5 fold increase in pelvic lymph node metastases a 10 fold increase in recurrences and a 50 decrease in survival 
the use of adjuvant radiotherapy to improve the outcome in the stage i cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter deep invasion and cls has been previously proposed 
thus adjunctive radiotherapy is beneficial for stage i cervical cancer patients with clinical pathological risk factors for recurrence other than positive nodes 
a significant number of women with stage ib cervical cancer should benefit from adjuvant pelvic irradiation because 25 of the lymph node negative patients have high risk factors according to the 1990 gog data 
since the node negative group accounts for one half of all stage ib cervical cancer deaths adjuvant radiotherapy for women with risk factors should substantially reduce the overall stage ib mortality 
an analysis of data on 575 women enrolled in a previous gynecologic oncology group gog study of clinical and pathologic predictors of surgically treated stage carcinoma of the cervix confirmed the roles of ltd dsi and cls as risk factors increasing the probability of cancer recurrence at 3 years from 2 to 31 
deep tumor invasion into cervical stroma measured either in millimeters or in thirds of the total cervical thickness has been also shown in association withlymph node metastases recurrence and poorer survival 
certain clinical and pathologic risk factors for stage 1 cervical cancer recurrence have been identified 
the gog 92 multicenter prospective randomized study was designed to determine whether postoperative pelvic radiotherapy following radical hysterectomy and pelvic node dissection would reduce the rate of recurrence and decrease the mortality in stage ib cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter deep stromal invasion by tumor and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces found on microscopic examination 
furthermore that study estimated that the proportion of women with such risk factors was 25 of all stage ib cervical cancer patients with negative lymph nodes 
institutional pathologists measured the depth of stromal tumor invasion with a millimeter ruler and made a determination of a presence or absence of cls 
this conclusion is based on a significant reduction of cancer recurrences in patients in our study and acceptably low morbidity with a single treatment related fatality 
a detailed gog clinical pathologic study had established that certain patients with poor prognostic factors related to the primary tumor i e large tumor size deep stromal invasion and capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement but without lymph node involvement had a risk of recurrence of 31 after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy 
moreover thomas and dembo have demonstrated that in absolute terms an equal number of deaths occur among the estimated 85 of stage ib cervical cancer patients with negative nodes as among the 15 with positive nodes 
increased morbidity in patients receiving full course radiotherapy following radical surgery for cervical cancer has been reported 
thirty 21 patients among those in the nft group died 25 18 from cancer compared to 18 13 deaths in the rt group 15 11 of whom died from cancer with one attributable to treatment table 5 
a previous gog study estimated that women with one of the following combinations of risk factors had on average a 31 chance of recurring in 3 years 
the pelvic irradiation was given with a fourfield technique with a megavoltage beam although cobalt 60 was allowed if the ssd was greater than 80 cm radiation dose was from 46 gy in 23 fractions to 50 4 gy in 28 fractions 5 fractions per week 
patients were eligible for the study if they had primary stage ib squamous adenosquamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of cervix initially treated with a standard radical hysterectomy and who had negative lymph nodes but one of the previously described combination of risk factors 
the study s target sample size was set at 169 eligible patients based on a desire to detect a 55 decrease in recurrence rate exponential model with l 5 0 01 recurrences month with the use of radiation therapy 
in 1993 the sample size goal was increased because of the lower than expected recurrence rate a better estimate of the change in the recurrence rate over time and a small but significant frequency of noncompliance in the radiation therapy rt regimen 
sedlis et al in a gog study of microinvasive cervical carcinoma reported two deaths among the 23 patients with vascular spread 
nevertheless the use of this formula by the participating institutions has been successful in achieving a high acceptance rate with only 22 patients 7 found ineligible for the study 
we reanalyzed our results using the cox model trying to simplify the formula or to use only a single risk factor as a predictor 
the gog attempted to conduct a randomized radiotherapy trial for women with positive nodes but could not complete the study because of failure to enroll a sufficient number of patients unpublished gog data 
the crude estimate in the reduction in risk in patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy was 47 i e relative risk 5 0 53 with the recurrence free rate of 88 in the radiotherapy group and 79 in the no further therapy group at 2 years fig 1 
the relative mortality rate is estimated at 0 64 which indicates 36 less mortality in the radiation group a significance level is not provided because the survival data are not mature 
there is a small but noteworthy imbalance in the follow up between the two treatment regimens
