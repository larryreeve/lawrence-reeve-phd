additional risk factors for recurrence e g large tumor diameter ltd deep stromal invasion dsi and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces cls found on microscopic examination have been only recently recognized and less extensively investigated than lymph node metastases 
an analysis of data on 575 women enrolled in a previous gynecologic oncology group gog study of clinical and pathologic predictors of surgically treated stage carcinoma of the cervix confirmed the roles of ltd dsi and cls as risk factors increasing the probability of cancer recurrence at 3 years from 2 to 31 
in 1988 the gog initiated a prospective randomized study gog 92 reported here to investigate the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy for stage i cervical cancer patients treated by conventional radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who were at high risk for recurrence because of ltd dsi cls but excluding patients with lymph node metastases 
the gog 92 multicenter prospective randomized study was designed to determine whether postoperative pelvic radiotherapy following radical hysterectomy and pelvic node dissection would reduce the rate of recurrence and decrease the mortality in stage ib cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter deep stromal invasion by tumor and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces found on microscopic examination 
the study s target sample size was set at 169 eligible patients based on a desire to detect a 55 decrease in recurrence rate exponential model with l 5 0 01 recurrences month with the use of radiation therapy 
in 1993 the sample size goal was increased because of the lower than expected recurrence rate a better estimate of the change in the recurrence rate over time and a small but significant frequency of noncompliance in the radiation therapy rt regimen 
patients were eligible for the study if they had primary stage ib squamous adenosquamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of cervix initially treated with a standard radical hysterectomy and who had negative lymph nodes but one of the previously described combination of risk factors 
radical hysterectomy required removal of the uterus and contiguous parametrial tissue to its most lateral extent along with paravaginal tissue and upper quarter of the vagina along the proximal uterosacral ligaments 
pelvic lymphadenectomy required bilateral removal of all nodal tissue and skeletonization of all vessels from the mid portion of the psoas muscle to uterer medially including the hypogastric artery and vein and from the obturator fossa anterior to the obturator nerve 
other eligibility criteria for enrollment into the study included normal blood counts normal liver and kidney function absence of genitourinary tract abnormality as determined by intravenous pyelogram renal sonogram or computerized tomography and absence of intercurrent diseases or other conditions that might not permit completion of the study or the required follow up 
the pelvic irradiation was given with a fourfield technique with a megavoltage beam although cobalt 60 was allowed if the ssd was greater than 80 cm radiation dose was from 46 gy in 23 fractions to 50 4 gy in 28 fractions 5 fractions per week 
patients were to be evaluated by physical examination blood counts blood chemistries and chest x rays every 3 months during the first 2 years of follow up and every 6 months during the subsequent years 
all histology slides were reviewed by two pathologists of the gog pathology committee who measured the depth of stromal invasion expressed in thirds of cervical thickness and ascertained the presence or absence of the capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement and the tumor cell type 
twenty two patients were excluded 14 because of lack of documentation of high risk criteria 4 for wrong stage 1 for inadequate surgery 2 for inadequate pathology material for review and 1 for not having an intravenous pyelogram or ct scan 
there were 128 46 patients with the risk factors of positive cls and deep one third stromal invasion 65 23 had positive cls middle third stromal invasion and tumor size 2 cm 82 30 had negative cls middle or deep third stromal invasion and a 4 cm tumor and 2 0 7 had positive cls superficial stromal invasion and tumor size 5 cm table 3 
of the 137 patients randomized to radiotherapy 9 6 6 refused all radiotherapy and 6 4 4 refused to continue therapy after receiving less than 85 of the prescribed dose of 50 4 gy 3 6 3 6 10 4 14 4 16 2 and 36 0 gy 
the crude estimate in the reduction in risk in patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy was 47 i e relative risk 5 0 53 with the recurrence free rate of 88 in the radiotherapy group and 79 in the no further therapy group at 2 years fig 1 
the cox model analysis indicated that when adjusting for all combinations of the three risk factors tumor size cls and the depth of invasion the risk of recurrence was significantly reduced by 44 in the radiation group p 5 0 019 one tail 
thirty 21 patients among those in the nft group died 25 18 from cancer compared to 18 13 deaths in the rt group 15 11 of whom died from cancer with one attributable to treatment table 5 
in an attempt to evaluate the impact of this imbalance the log rank test was recalculated assuming the first five patients lost the excess number in the rt group recurred at the time of their last clinical evaluation 
other serious adverse effects regressed either spontaneously transient paraplegia in one patient or after treatment percutaneous nephrostomies for bilateral ureteral obstruction and transfusion of packed cells for severe anemia with a drop of hematocrit to 20 
chung et al reported that cervical cancer larger than 4 cm in diameter determined by preoperative palpation was associated with a 5 fold increase in pelvic lymph node metastases a 10 fold increase in recurrences and a 50 decrease in survival 
nevertheless we found tumor diameter to be the most significant risk factors in the cox model analysis of our study results confirming multiple data sets which demonstrate that the size of the primary cancer is critical for local control despite the imprecision of measurement 
a detailed gog clinical pathologic study had established that certain patients with poor prognostic factors related to the primary tumor i e large tumor size deep stromal invasion and capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement but without lymph node involvement had a risk of recurrence of 31 after radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy 
the present prospective randomized study showed that adjunctive radiotherapy significantly reduced the number of cancer recurrences in women with the above risk factors by 44 and that the difference in recurrences between irradiated and nonirradiated patients was statistically significant at the p 5 0 019 level 
however caution must be observed due to the disproportionately higher number of patients that are lost to followup among those receiving radiation therapy and the need for further follow up to determine what impact radiation therapy has on survival 
more recently thomas and dembo postulated that women with negative nodes but primary tumor related poor prognostic factors were more likely to recur in the pelvis than in distant sites and therefore may benefit from pelvic irradiation 
our present study confirms both predicted and reported benefits from postoperative radiation it should be noted that the 27 recurrence rate at 3 years in our study population is lower than the anticipated one third 
a significant number of women with stage ib cervical cancer should benefit from adjuvant pelvic irradiation because 25 of the lymph node negative patients have high risk factors according to the 1990 gog data 
moreover thomas and dembo have demonstrated that in absolute terms an equal number of deaths occur among the estimated 85 of stage ib cervical cancer patients with negative nodes as among the 15 with positive nodes
