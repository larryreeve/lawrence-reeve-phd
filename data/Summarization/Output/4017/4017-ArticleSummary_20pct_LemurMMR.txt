standard therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer is fluorouracil commonly modulated by calcium folinate which typically yields a median survival time of 10 14 months 
moreover irinotecan combined with fluorouracil and calcium folinate is the only treatment to show a survival advantage in metastatic colorectal cancer over high dose continuous infusion fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone 
we did a phase iii multicentre randomised trial that was designed to assess whether the addition of irinotecan to fluorouracil and calcium folinate would benefit patients previously untreated with chemotherapy other than adjuvant for metastatic colorectal cancer 
the results we achieved with the irinotecan combination treatment show that the addition of irinotecan to weekly or 2 weekly regimens of fluorouracil and calcium folinate by infusion brings clear clinical benefit and should be considered as a first line reference treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer as well as for advanced disease 
in the irinotecan group admission was required for fever in the absence of infection with concomitant grade 3 or 4 neutropenia for five 9 3 patients on the weekly regimen and one 0 7 on the 2 weekly regimen for the no irinotecan group admission was required for one 2 3 patient on the weekly regimen and none on the 2 weekly regimen 
fluorouracil can be used as first line or second line therapy and a different regimen of fluorouracil can be administered as second line treatment if first line treatment fails 
in the irinotecan group the relative dose intensity was 0 82 for irinotecan and 0 81 for fluorouracil in the weekly regimen and 0 93 and 0 92 respectively in the 2 weekly regimen 
for the noirinotecan group the regimens were once weekly fluorouracil 2600 mg m by 24 h infusion plus calcium folinate 500 mg m2 n 43 or every 2 weeks fluorouracil and calcium folinate at the same doses and administration as in the irinotecan group 2weekly regimen n 143 
in two phase iii studies for oxaliplatin in combination with infusional fluorouracil and calcium folinate the response rate and progression free survival were better than with fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone 
for the irinotecan group the regimens were once weekly irinotecan 80 mg m with fluorouracil 2300 mg m by 24 h infusion plus calcium folinate 500 mg m n 54 or every 2 weeks irinotecan 180 mg m on day 1 with fluorouracil 400 mg m bolus and 600 mg m by 22 h infusion plus calcium folinate 200 mg m on days 1 and 2 n 145 
phase iii studies of patients whose disease had not responded to first line fluorouracil or patients whose disease had progressed after first line fluorouracil treatment showed increased survival times in patients given irinotecan compared with those receiving best supportive care or high dose fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone by continuous infusion 
data suggest that the development of well tolerated regimens that combine irinotecan and high dose fluorouracil and calcium folinate may be beneficial in the first line treatment of colorectal cancer 
before the start of the study each investigator chose one of two proposed regimens for fluorouracil and calcium folinate according to local clinical practice or preference de gramont every 2 weeks or arbeitsgemeinschaft internische onkologie cooperative german group for oncology once weekly 
these regimens were selected for first line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer based on promising antitumour efficacy and an acceptable safety profile 
the frequency and profile of tumour related symptoms and laboratory abnormalities were typical of advanced colorectal cancer and similar in the two groups 
the median duration of treatment was longer in the irinotecan than in the no irinotecan group irrespective of regimen 24 0 vs 21 0 weeks for the weekly regimen 24 6 vs 18 0 for the 2 weekly regimen 
for analysis by two tailed log rank test a 0 05 power of 0 80 with the assumption that accrual and minimum follow up would last for 6 months and 9 months respectively we had to include 143 patients in each treatment group 
there was insufficient power to compare the efficacy risk of progression for a patient in the no irinotecan group was increased by about 69 compared with that for a patient in the irinotecan group when all other variables were equal 
for the 2 weekly regimen 16 11 0 patients in the irinotecan group and two 1 4 in the no irinotecan group were admitted for diarrhoea 
diarrhoea was the main reason for dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment in the weekly regimen and neutropenia was the main reason for dose delay in the 2 weekly regimen 
doses were reduced because of toxic effects more frequently for the weekly regimen than for the 2 weekly regimen and more in the irinotecan than in the noirinotecan group 
one patient treated with the irinotecan combination on the 2 weekly regimen did not receive appropriate therapy for the management of diarrhoea and died early in the first cycle probably because of septic shock concomitant with grade 4 neutropenia 
no other combination therapy has shown such high antitumour efficacy over high dose continuous infusion of fluorouracil and calcium folinate to date 
another phase iii study that compared irinotecan combined with bolus fluorouracil and fluorouracil alone consistently provided significantly higher response rates 33 vs 18 p 0 001 and median time to treatment failure 5 0 vs 3 8 months p 0 05 in the irinotecan group 
from may 1997 to february 1998 we enrolled patients who met the following eligibility criteria histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum age 18 75 years who performance status of 2 or less and life expectancy of more than 3 months haemoglobin 100 g l or more absolute neutrophil count 2 0 10 l platelets 150 10 l or more creatinine 1 25 or less times the upper limit of normal total bilirubin 1 25 or less times the upper limit of normal aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase 3 0 or less times the upper limit of normal if liver metastases present 1 5 or less times for bilirubin and 5 0 or less times for aspartate and alanine aminotransferases and no previous other than adjuvant chemotherapy finished more than 6 months before randomisation 
for the weekly regimen each treatment cycle was 7 weeks and for the 2 weekly regimen 6 weeks 
we randomly assigned patients irinotecan combined with fluorouracil and calcium folinate irinotecan group or fluorouracil and calcium folinate only no irinotecan group figure 1 
we used the validated qlqc30 questionnaire of the european organization for research and treatment of cancer 
these regimens were used for combined treatment and fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone 
the questionnaire includes five scales for functioning one scale for global health status and nine symptom scales 
irinotecan was administered according to the guidelines used for irinotecan monotherapy including recommendations for the use of concurrent antiemetics atropine and loperamide
