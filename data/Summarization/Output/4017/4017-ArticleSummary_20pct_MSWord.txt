Patients.

We randomly assigned patients irinotecan combined with fluorouracil and calcium folinate (irinotecan group) or fluorouracil and calcium folinate only (no-irinotecan group, figure 1). We needed to include 338 evaluable patients to show a significant difference in response rate between treatment groups, assuming response rates of 35% in the no-irinotecan group and 50% in the irinotecan group, by use of two-tailed X tests (a=0.05, power 0.80). 

2 tests were used to compare categorical variables between treatment groups. Patients and treatment.

387 patients were randomly assigned treatment. Of the 385 patients treated in the study, only 97 (25%) received treatment by the weekly regimen (54 in the irinotecan group and 43 in the no-irinotecan group). The other 288 patients received treatment every 2 weeks (145 in the irinotecan group and 143 in the no-irinotecan group). 

A higher proportion of women were assigned fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone than the irinotecan regimen, and the rectum was the primary tumour site in a higher proportion of patients in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group. 

Tumour characteristics and history in the two groups were comparable, except for previous surgery, since 89% of patients had had surgery in the irinotecan group and 95% in the no-irinotecan group. The median duration of treatment was longer in the irinotecan than in the no-irinotecan group, irrespective of regimen (24.0 vs 21.0 weeks for the weekly regimen, 24.6 vs 18.0 for the 2-weekly regimen). 

In the irinotecan group, the relative dose intensity was 0.82 for irinotecan and 0.81 for fluorouracil in the weekly regimen, and 0.93 and 0.92, respectively, in the 2-weekly regimen. 39.4% of patients in the irinotecan group and 58.3% in the no-irinotecan group received further chemotherapy; 31.0% of the no-irinotecan group subseqently received irinotecan. In the evaluable population, the response rate was 49% in the irinotecan group, compared with 31% in the noirinotecan group (p<0.001). The median time to onset of response was 8.9 (range 4.7-25.4) weeks in the irinotecan group medians.21 The probability of survival in the irinotecan group was 84.9% at 9 months and 75.5% at 12 months, and in the no-irinotecan group was 77.3% and 62.7%, respectively. The median duration of response was 9.3 (2.8-13.1) months in the irinotecan group and 8.8 (3.7-11.8) months in the no-irinotecan group (p=0.08). Median followirinotecan group was 69.8% and 54.8%, respectively.

The effect of treatment was significant (p<0.001); the Survival in the irinotecan group was significantly longer hazard ratio for response was 2.6 times higher in the than in the no-irinotecan group (median 17.4 [0.4-28.4+] irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group, given the same degree of weight loss at baseline and the same time between first diagnosis and first metastasis. 
The median time to treatment failure was 5.3 (0.4-15.7+) months in the irinotecan group and 3.8 (0.4-11.5+) months in the no-irinotecan group (p=0.0014).

The time to definitive deterioration in performance status was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group (median 11.2 [0.1+.15.7+]) vs 9.9 [0+.13¡¤6+] months, p=0.046; figure 4 ). 

Among patients receiving the weekly regimen, diarrhoea led to hospital admission for 17 (31.5%) in the irinotecan group and five (11.6%) in the no-irinotecan group. For the 2-weekly regimen, 16 (11.0%) patients in the irinotecan group and two (1.4%) in the no-irinotecan group were admitted for diarrhoea. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and leukopenia were significantly more frequent in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group, irrespective of regimen. Grade 3 or 4 infection without grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was significantly more frequent in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group. In the irinotecan group, about 25% of patients developed cholinergic syndromes that were rarely severe. 

Doses were reduced in 29.6% of patients on the weekly regimen and 18.6% on the 2 weekly regimen in the irinotecan and no-irinotecan groups, respectively, and in 20.9% and 4.9% on the 2 weekly regimen. 

Despite the high frequency of side-effects, in the irinotecan group, the relative dose intensity was preserved compared with the no-irinotecan group. 


The rate of return was similar in the two treatment groups.62% in the irinotecan group and 59% in the no-irinotecan group. Combination of irinotecan with fluorouracil and calcium folinate significantly increased response rates, time to progression, and survival.
