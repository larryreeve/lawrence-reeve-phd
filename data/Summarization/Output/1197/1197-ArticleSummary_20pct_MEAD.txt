Adjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma is controversial because previous trials reported conflicting results. The present study was designed with restricted selection criteria and high dose-intensities of the two most active chemotherapeutic agents. Patients between 18 and 65 years of age with grade 3 to 4 spindle-cell sarcomas primary diameter 5 cm or any size recurrent tumor in extremities or girdles were eligible. Stratification was by primary versus recurrent tumors and by tumor diameter greater than or equal to 10 cm versus less than 10 cm. One hundred four patients were randomized 51 to the control group and 53 to the treatment group five cycles of 4'-epidoxorubicin 60 mg/m2 days 1 and 2 and ifosfamide 1.8 g/m2 days 1 through 5 with hydration mesna and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. After a median follow-up of 59 months 60 patients had relapsed and 48 died 28 and 20 in the treatment arm and 32 and 28 in the control arm respectively. The median disease-free survival DFS was 48 months in the treatment group and 16 months in the control group P .04 and the median overall survival OS was 75 months for treated and 46 months for untreated patients P .03. For OS the absolute benefit deriving from chemotherapy was 13 at 2 years and increased to 19 at 4 years P .04. Intensified adjuvant chemotherapy had a positive impact on the DFS and OS of patients with high-risk extremity soft tissue sarcomas at a median follow-up of 59 months. Nevertheless a great proportion of high-risk soft tissue sarcoma patients develop distant metastases during their lives. In the early 1960s this clinical behaviour prompted the introduction of adjuvant chemotherapy trials with the aim of increasing DFS and possibly overall survival OS. The main findings were statistical evidence in favor of chemotherapy for local metastasis and overall DFS P .016 .0003 and .0001 respectively and a trend towards increased OS P .12. Here we report the results of the Italian co-operative study after a median follow-up of 59 months and a minimum time between randomization and date last seen of 28 months among patients who did not die. The patients who satisfied all the selection criteria were then stratified and subsequently randomized to a control or chemotherapy group. Statistical Considerations On the basis of the estimated proportions of patients free from metastatic disease 2 years after diagnosis 60 in the treated group v 40 in the control group it was estimated that 95 patients were required per arm beta 0.80 alpha 0.05. All centers faxed protocol-specific eligibility checklists to the statistics office in Aviano patients were stratified using a four-block stratification by primary tumor diameter 10 cm v 10 cm and recurrent tumor diameter 10 cm v 10 cm and randomized to treatment or control groups. Overall DFS was defined as the time between randomization and the first recurrence and OS was defined as the time between randomization and death as a result of disease patients dying in complete remission were considered as censored on the date of death for OS. Under the auspices of the Italian National Council for Research CNR 104 patients 53 in the chemotherapy and 51 in the control arm entered the study between June 1992 and November 1996. The remaining 68 patients 65 were treated using a limb-sparing procedure involving radiation therapy and surgery 45 underwent surgery and postoperative radiation therapy and 24 underwent preoperative radiation therapy and conservative surgery Table 1. The median time between surgery and the start of chemotherapy was 62 days range 8 to 187 days in the three cases with early metastases the time intervals between surgery and relapse were 42 74 and 89 days. One patient refused the fifth and last cycle for personal reasons and three patients did not complete the treatment because of related toxicities reappearance of viral uveitis consecutive episodes of pneumonitis and persistent leukopenia after two three and four cycles respectively. At the time of statistical analysis November 1999 the median follow-up for the 104 patients included in the study was 59 months 61 months in the treatment arm and 55 months in the control arm. During the follow-up period disease recurrences were recorded in 28 of the 53 treated patients and in 32 of the 51 patients who did not undergo adjuvant therapy 20 treated patients and 28 untreated patients died. Univariate analyses did not reveal any statistically significant difference in overall DFS and OS for any of the characteristics considered age sex center of surgery histology grading site of primary tumor presentation diameter local treatment and stratification with the exception of adjuvant treatment data not shown. Furthermore nine patients developed metachronous relapse at a different site three were local relapse after a metastasis and six were distant relapses after a previous local relapse. Four patients had local relapses simultaneously with metastasis one patient in the control arm and three in the treatment arm and another three patients developed a local relapse as the second relapse after a distant metastasis two patients in the treatment arm and one patient in the control arm. Taking into account the overall local relapse rate all local events observed 11 patients in the control group and nine in the treatment group experienced local failure. As the first event a total of 47 distant relapses were observed 22 single distant events in the control group and 21 in the treatment group one synchronous distant and local event in the control group and three in the treatment group Table 4. The estimated cumulative incidence function at 2 years was 28 for the control arm and 45 for the treatment arm P .08 at 4 years it was 44 and 45 respectively P .94. The median survival time was higher among patients who underwent adjuvant therapy 75 months compared with untreated patients 46 months Fig 4. The absolute improvement deriving from chemotherapy was 13 at 2 years 85 and 72 in the treatment and control arms respectively P .10 and the improvement increased to 19 at 4 years 69 and 50 P .04 Table 5. Furthermore in the subgroup of 886 patients affected by extremity sarcomas the difference in OS between treated and untreated patients was significant P .029 and the absolute benefit after 10 years increased to 7. In fact despite the routine use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor grade 4 leukopenia was observed in 28 of the administered cycles neutropenic fever in 13 of the patients 16 episodes out of 223 cycles 7.2 and anemia requiring multiple transfusions occurred in 24 of the patients. The main finding of the intention-to-treat analysis in this study is the beneficial impact of chemotherapy on the DFS P .04 and OS P .03 for patients affected by high-risk extremity soft tissue sarcomas and treated with chemotherapy. However between the three different local approaches there was a trend in favor of preoperative radiation therapy two local relapse of 24 patients in the control arm 8.3. Questions regarding the adequacy of the surgical approach and consequently the adequacy of margins could be raised but only 10 patients were treated outside of referral centers and only two of those patients had local relapses.
