stratification was by primary versus recurrent tumors and by tumor diameter greater than or equal to 10 cm versus less than 10 cm one hundred four patients were randomized 51 to the control group and 53 to the treatment group five cycles of 4 epidoxorubicin 60 mg m2 days 1 and 2 and ifosfamide 1 8 g m2 days 1 through 5 with hydration mesna and granulocyte colony stimulating factor 
the median disease free survival dfs was 48 months in the treatment group and 16 months in the control group p 04 and the median overall survival os was 75 months for treated and 46 months for untreated patients p 03 
the treatment of limb sarcomas mainly relies on a combined modality approach after the demonstration that pre or postoperative radiation and conservative surgery led to local control in a high proportion of patients 4 in fact limb sparing procedures allow an 85 to 90 local dis ease free survival dfs rate and demolitive surgery now represents only 5 to 10 of the operations in comparison with the 50 survival rate of the 1960s to 1970s 
here we report the results of the italian co operative study after a median follow up of 59 months and a minimum time between randomization and date last seen of 28 months among patients who did not die 
the staging consisted of a computed tomography ct scan and or magnetic resonance imaging of the primary lesion and a ct scan of the thorax other specific tests angiography bone scan ct scan of the brain and so on were performed only in the case of clinical suspicion 
inclusion criteria were as follows age 18 to 65 years eastern cooperative oncology group ecog performance status less than or equal to 2 primary tumors subfascially localized with diameter greater than or equal to 5 cm high grade spindle cell or polymorphous sarcomas fibrosarcoma malignant fibrous histiocytoma polymorphous liposarcoma leiomyosarcoma synovial sarcoma malignant schwannoma angiosarcoma and polymorphous rhabdomyosarcoma local relapse of any size no previous radio chemotherapy adequate bone marrow wbc count of 4 000 fil platelets 120 000 ml and hemoglobin 10 g dl renal creatinine 1 3 mg dl hepatic sgot 2 5 x normal value and bilirubin 1 2 mg dl and pulmonary functions 
preoperative radiation therapy 44 8 gy in 28 fractions in 2 5 weeks 160 cgy fraction 2 fractions per day followed by resection with or without a post or intraoperative boost 16 to 18 gy for positive or close surgical margins was used for tumors extending to critical structures for which conservative surgical resection was expected to be inadequate and amputation would usually have to be performed to obtain negative margins 
chemotherapy repeated every 3 weeks consisted of five cycles of 4 epidoxorubicin epi 60 mg m2 die in a short intravenous iv infusion on days 1 and 2 total dose per cycle 120 mg m2 ifo 1 8 g m2 die diluted in 500 ml of normal saline and administered over 1 hour on days 1 through 5 total dose per cycle 9 g m2 and 6 mercapto ethansulfonate in a bolus iv injection at 20 of the ifo dose given before and 4 and 8 hours after the ifo infusions 
in the case of incomplete hematologic recovery defined as wbc 4 000 ml and platelets plts 100 000 ml treatment was postponed by one or more weeks furthermore on complete hematologic recovery a dose reduction of epi was applied depending on the observed nadirs wbc 1 000 ml and plts 75 000 ml ifo and epi doses both 100 wbc 500 ml and plts 50 000 ml ifo dose 100 and epi dose 75 wbc 500 ml and plts 50 000 ml ifo dose 100 and epi dose 50 
physical examinations routine chemistry and x ray of the thorax and bones underlying the primary site were performed every 2 months and a ct scan of the thorax was performed every 6 months for the first 2 years 
the same procedures were repeated every 3 months during the third year and every 6 months during the fourth and fifth year of follow up with a ct scan of the thorax and or primary site performed at every other visit 
on the basis of the estimated proportions of patients free from metastatic disease 2 years after diagnosis 60 in the treated group v 40 in the control group it was estimated that 95 patients were required per arm beta 0 80 alpha 0 05 
all centers faxed protocol specific eligibility checklists to the statistics office in aviano patients were stratified using a four block stratification by primary tumor diameter 10 cm v 10 cm and recurrent tumor diameter 10 cm v 10 cm and randomized to treatment or control groups 
overall dfs was defined as the time between randomization and the first recurrence and os was defined as the time between randomization and death as a result of disease patients dying in complete remission were considered as censored on the date of death for os 
the intensities of local recurrences and of distant with or without simultaneous local recurrences were estimated by the cumulative incidence function cif approach to the analysis of competing risks 14 the wilcoxon rank sum test was used to test the hypothesis of equality of the distribution of some covariates in the two treatment groups 
the median time between surgery and the start of chemotherapy was 62 days range 8 to 187 days in the three cases with early metastases the time intervals between surgery and relapse were 42 74 and 89 days 
one patient refused the fifth and last cycle for personal reasons and three patients did not complete the treatment because of related toxicities reappearance of viral uveitis consecutive episodes of pneumonitis and persistent leukopenia after two three and four cycles respectively 
a total of 223 cycles were administered 62 28 at a reduced epi dose 12 of the total cycles had doses reduced to 75 and 16 were reduced to 50 contrary to the protocol ifo was also reduced to 75 and 50 of the planned dose in 3 and 1 of the total cycles respectively 
twenty four percent of the cycles were delayed for toxicity or for nonmedical reasons in the majority of these cases 16 the delay was shorter than 1 week and can be attributed to logistic problems rather than to toxicity 
the mean administered doses of the fifth cycle 94 mg of epi and 8 156 mg of ifo were slightly lower than those of the fourth cycle 95 5 mg of epi and 8 257 mg of ifo 
from the third cycle grade 4 leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were less frequent because of the applied dose reductions and anemia became the most important hematologic side effect requiring repeated packed red cell transfusions in 24 of the patients 
the ranges for the observation time ie the time between randomization and date of last visit among censored patients who did not die were 28 to 84 months 39 to 84 months and 28 to 81 months respectively 
univariate analyses did not reveal any statistically significant difference in overall dfs and os for any of the characteristics considered age sex center of surgery histology grading site of primary tumor presentation diameter local treatment and stratification with the exception of adjuvant treatment data not shown 
because none of the patient characteristics was associated with the end point at the time of univariate analysis unadjusted hazard ratios hr and their 95 confidence intervals ci were computed by means of the cox proportional hazards model 
four patients had local relapses simultaneously with metastasis one patient in the control arm and three in the treatment arm and another three patients developed a local relapse as the second relapse after a distant metastasis two patients in the treatment arm and one patient in the control arm 
the distribution between the different local treatment modalities radical surgery surgery and postoperative radiation therapy and preoperative radiation therapy and surgery was respectively two of 16 patients seven of 20 and two of 15 for the control group and three of 20 patients six of 24 and zero of nine for the treatment group 
as the first event a total of 47 distant relapses were observed 22 single distant events in the control group and 21 in the treatment group one synchronous distant and local event in the control group and three in the treatment group table 4 
the absolute improvement deriving from chemotherapy was 13 at 2 years 85 and 72 in the treatment and control arms respectively p 10 and the improvement increased to 19 at 4 years 69 and 50 p 04 table 5 
the preliminary data of previous studies were sometimes positive for dfs and os 15 19 but further analyses made after an adequate follow up time indicated a disappearance of the positive effect of chemotherapy on 20 21 and in some cases worse results 22 however the recently published meta analysis 7 involving 1 568 patients showed a statistically significant benefit for treated patients of 6 10 and 10 for local metastatic and overall dfs respectively and a favorable but not statistically significant trend in os 4 after a median of 9 4 years of follow up 
in fact disease stages tumor sizes and grading varied greatly 23 second eight studies made use of a polychemotherapy including an anthracycline vincristine cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine but only the first is active in soft tissue sarcomas the others probably increased toxicity 
third six studies used doxorubicin as a single agent at doses ranging from 60 to 90 mg m2 per cycle total doses of 420 to 540 mg m2 whereas the per cycle and total doxorubicin doses in the polychemotherapy studies were 50 to 90 mg m2 and 200 to 550 mg m2 respectively indicating possible underdosing of the principal active agent 
furthermore these studies did not use ifo which is now recognized as an active agent in this disease 24 26 in addition to the inclusion of ifo the recent introduction of hematopoietic growth factors has allowed an increase in the doses and dose intensity without negatively affecting patient safety 
the early 1990s saw the activation of a number of second generation protocols throughout the world which although they were planned independently were extraordinarily similar in terms of their selection criteria chemotherapeutic regimens and use of growth factors 
it is directly derived from consecutive phase i ii dose intensification trials carried out at the centro di riferimento oncologico of aviano 27 31 the epirubicin dose level of 60 mg m2 x 2 days represents the step before the maximum tolerated dose established in those trials 70 mg m2 epirubicin x 2 days when given in combination with fixed full doses of ifosfamide 1 8 g m2 d x 5 days in advanced cases of soft tissue sarcoma 
this maximum tolerated dose gave 13 responses of 13 assessable patients but induced relevant toxicities 31 therefore in the present study the age of the patients was limited to 65 years the number of cycles was limited to five and a predefined dose reduction scheme was established to reduce the dose of anthracycline depending on the level of leukopenia reached during the previous cycle 
in fact despite the routine use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor grade 4 leukopenia was observed in 28 of the administered cycles neutropenic fever in 13 of the patients 16 episodes out of 223 cycles 7 2 and anemia requiring multiple transfusions occurred in 24 of the patients 
the main finding of the intention to treat analysis in this study is the beneficial impact of chemotherapy on the dfs p 04 and os p 03 for patients affected by high risk extremity soft tissue sarcomas and treated with chemotherapy 
moreover this treatment option5 32 33 was chosen for those patients presenting with locally far advanced disease or with disease approaching critical structures nerves and vessels therefore a high incidence of local relapse could be foreseen 
however because our study was designed in 1991 and activated in june 1992 and included only 104 patients it is possible that an imbalance of other prognostic factors not included in table 1 could have led to the difference in outcome between the two groups
