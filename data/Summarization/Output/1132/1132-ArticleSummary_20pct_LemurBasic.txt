although much progress has been made in the early detection and control of carcinoma of the cervix since the introduction of the papanicolau test it is estimated that about 13 500 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 1990 in the united states with 6 000 patients dying from the disease 
the incidence is even more pronounced in developing countries where carcinoma of the cervix is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in females with the majority of the patients presenting with advanced disease 
while surgery and radiotherapy rt are equally effective in early stage disease radiation therapy has been the primary treatment modality for stage iii disease with 5 year survival rates between 30 to 45 being reported 4 8 attempts to improve these results including the use of hypoxic cell sensitizers hyperbaric oxygen therapy 0 and neutron therapy have met with limited or no success 
vogl et al and alberts et al using a combination of bleomycin vincristine mitomycin and cisplatin bomp in patients with metastatic and or recurrent disease reported high response rates 20 of the patients with a complete response cr with acceptable toxicity 
the use of upfront ct as initial treatment before pelvic rt would be theoretically advantageous as the vascular supply to the tumor is not compromised allowing a higher local tissue concentration of drugs thereby improving the effectiveness of ct 
to test this hypothesis we began in 1984 at the instituto nacional de cancer rio de janeiro brazil a prospective randomized trial comparing neoadjuvant bomp ct followed by pelvic rt ct rt versus pelvic rt alone in patients with stage iiib carcinoma of the cervix 
eligibility criteria consisted of a histopathologic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma age younger than 70 years with no past history of malignancy the lower third of the vagina free of disease and a performance status greater than 50 in the karnofsky scale 
patients also needed to have adequate medullary reserve wbc 4 000 ipl platelet count 100 000 p l and normal renal bun 8 9 mmol l creatinine 130 rimol l creatinine clearance 1 17 ml s and liver alkaline phosphatase 110 u l bilirubin 21 pimol l function 
in the ct rt group 11 refused further therapy including pelvic rt after only one cycle of ct and two others were found to have abnormal renal function after randomization and before commencement of treatment 
the superior limit of the radiation field was the l5 s1 junction the lower limit wasthe caudal pole of obturator foramen and the lateral boundaries were 1 5 cm beyond the lymph nodes as demonstrated on lymphangiography 
a dose of 40 gy was routinely prescribed to point a which was located 2 cm superior to the cervical os applicator flange and 2 cm lateral to the central axis of the uterus 
chemotherapy consisted of bleomycin 15 u intramuscularly im every 12 hours from days 1 to 4 total dose 120 u vincristine 1 mg m2 iv on day 1 mitomycin 10 mg im 2 iv on day 1 and cisplatin 50 mg m2 iv on day 1 given on an outpatient basis every 3 weeks for three cycles 
six months after activation of the study after nine patients had been treated with ct the bleomycin dose was reduced to 15 u im every 12 hours from day 1 to day 3 total dose 90 u and after the first year cisplatin administration was changed from day 1 to day 4 
a cr was defined as the complete resolution of all measurable disease and symptoms a partial response pr was defined as a 50 or more decrease in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of measurable disease and stable disease sd was defined as less than a 50 decrease in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of the measurable lesions 
late complications were graded as per the morbidity grading system suggested by pilepich et al 2 which takes into consideration the impact of the complication on the patient performance and or life style and the required treatment for such complications table 2 
we planned to accrue 60 patients into each treatment arm which would produce a power of 80 and detect an improvement of 25 in survival with the combined modality treatment at the a 0 05 level two sided test 
the study was closed earlier because an interim analysis showed that apart from increased serious toxicity survival was significantly worse in the combined approach group and we did not feel that a positive result could be obtained with a larger sample 
seven patients were not included in response assessment in the combined modality group four patients who died of ct complications two who died of metastatic disease all of them before commencement of rt and one other patient whosepelvic disease progressed during ct and who received palliative irradiation only because of poor general condition 
at the end of therapy or even after several months posttreatment it is difficult to be certain whether some of the pelvic findings are due to residual tumor or postirradiation fibrosis allowing misinterpretation of tumor responses 
for the partial responders 57 in the rt arm and 37 5 in the ct rt are alive with no evidence of disease progression at a minimum follow up time of 3 years 
these numbers are similar to those patients who were felt to have obtained a cr only 59 10 of 17 and 40 six of 15 are still alive in the rt and ct rt groups respectively 
one patient in the rt group who had grade 3 cystitis characterized by frequent hematuria presented to the emergency room 19 months following completion of pelvic rt with gross hematuria with clots 
the rationale for the use of neoadjuvant ct23 is that 1 the blood supply to the tumor is not compromised by previous radiotherapy or surgery allowing for better drug distribution into the tumor 2 patients tolerance to ct may be enhanced as performance status and marrow reserve are unaltered by previous treatment 3 decreasing the bulkiness of the primary disease would improve the effectiveness of the local rt 4 there is the possibility of eradication of subclinical metastases and 5 theoretically a tumor may be more chemosensitive before surgery or rt 
although 25 5 of the patients achieved a cr following three cycles of bomp and 47 of the ct rt group obtained a cr at the end of rt the 5 year overall survival was significantly inferior in the ct rt group than in the control arm 39 v 21 p 02 
it cannot be accounted for by patient selection as both groups were well balanced for the wellknown prognostic factors in stage iii carcinoma of the cervix 4 24 27 more importantly all patients in the ct rt arm completed pelvic rt as defined by the protocol guidelines and therefore inadequate irradiation dosage cannot explain the poorer results 
since repopulation by surviving tumor clonogens is not a specific response to rt but rather results from killing of tumor cells these authors have suggested that ct which is effective in killing cells could also lead to an accelerated regrowth of surviving clonogens lessening the effect of subsequent rt 
similarly in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck upfront ct has produced impressive response rates but again this has not led to an improvement in survival rates over those achieved with rt alone 
withers et a1 have suggested that the accelerated repopulationlate in the treatment involves only a small number of surviving cells and rapid repopulation would not be detectable as a change in volume of the total tumor mass 
thus a pr or even a cr could therefore be of questionable value in determining therapeutic effectiveness as tumor masses would be still regressing while the subclinical clonogenic cell repopulation is accelerating 
the mechanisms by which this increased cell proliferation occurs are not entirely clear although as suggested by tannock 34 it may result from improved nutrition of surviving cells following shrinkage of the tumor due to previous therapy 
the mechanisms responsible for such cross resistance remain to be determined but recent studies have shown significant similarity between the cytotoxicity of irradiation and alkylating agents and that tumor cells may develop mechanisms of resistance capable of decreasing the cytotoxic effects of some antineoplastic drugs as well as radiation 
these authors treated 23 patients 20 cervical cancer two vulvar one ovarian and observed the development of pulmonary toxicity in eight patients 34 5 with five of them dying a respiratory death while free of disease 
theuse of concomitant ct usually fluorouracil and or cisplatin and rt has shown promising therapeutic results in a variety of tumors43 45 and may prove useful in circumventing the problem of accelerated regrowth of surviving clonogens
