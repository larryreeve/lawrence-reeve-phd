since june 1973 the therapeutic and toxicologic effects of cmf cyclophosphamide methotrexate and fluorouracil chemotherapy were evaluated at the istituto nazionale tumori of milan as adjuvant treatment in patients with operable breast cancer and histologically positive axillary nodes 
it appears evident that a the two series given 12 cycles of cmf achieved the same results b the data reported in the three series treated with cmf are almost equivalent c adjuvant cmf whether administered for 12 or 6 cycles was able to alter the course of operable breast cancer with positive axillary lymph nodes compared to the group subjected to radical mastectomy alone 
in fact the retrospective evaluation of roentgenograms revealed the presence of distant metastases prior to radical mastectomy in 3 patients cmf 12 1 cmf 6 2 while 4 additional women cmf 12 3 cmf 6 1 had fixation of the primary tumor to the underlying pectoral fascia or muscle t3b 
more recently the guy s hospital and manchester study groups reported the actuarial 5 yr rfs of a randomized study comparing radical mastectomy alone versus melphalan versus cmf and showed that the only group significantly improved by adjuvant cmf was that of postmenopausal women while premenopausal patients had findings that were superimposable in all three treatment groups 
for this reason in september 1975 we started a new prospective study with the intent to evaluate the possibility of reducing the duration of adjuvant cmf without compromising the therapeutic effect of combined treatment 
in postmenopausal women with more than 3 nodes the difference between cmf 12 34 4 and cmf 6 54 9 p 0 18 is only apparent since the confidence limits throughout the curve totally blurred the percent difference standard error or se at 5 yr 8 4 and 11 3 respectively 
only long term analysis will answer the questions of whether the addition of adjuvant hormone therapy to chemotherapy will improve the results in er tumors and whether the excellent results reported by the m d anderson hospital with fac fluorouracil adriamycin cyclophosphamide in women with 4 axillary nodes 7 will be reproducible 
the dose of all three drugs was reduced by 50 when the leukocyte count ranged from 3900 to 2500 cu mm or the platelet count from 99 000 to 75 000 cu mm in the presence of more severe myelosuppression treatment was delayed until at least half of the dose could be administered 
low dose cmf was applied only in 12 of 83 14 of the present 12 cycle group and in 6 of 52 12 of the 6 cycle group 
based on the 3 yr analysis of our first cmf study showing an apparent lack of therapeutic advantage following adjuvant chemotherapy in postmenopausal women randomization for this group of patients was discontinued at the end of november 1976 
based on our current findings i e therapeutic efficacy of adjuvant cmf regardless of er status there seems to be no clinical reason to withhold the administration of adjuvant combination chemotherapy in node positive women even in the presence of er tumors 
probabilities represent comparison of the entire plots computed by use of the productlimit method and were calculated using the log rank test and values of significance 
the aim of the first program was to evaluate whether cmf given after radical surgery was able to alter the course of the disease 
through the analysis of our results in advanced breast cancer treated with cmf skipper came to the conclusion that in clinically metastatic disease the nadir in surviving tumor cells is probably reached in the majority of patients in less than 6 cycles 
only a small subgroup of 22 patients 4 8 refused to complete the planned program and this was essentially due to negative psychologic reasons since these patients objected to being on a heavy and toxic treatment program drug injections and timing of follow up without having visible disease 
the observation that in some patient subsets 6 cycles of cmf yielded apparently superior results to 12 cycles is probably related to the relative number of patients in each group and to the different median follow up in postmenopausal women whose accrual was discontinued in december 1976 
the results obtained in our series between er and er tumors coupled with the overall findings observed in the two menopausal groups further contribute to minimize the possible therapeutic role of chemotherapy induced adjuvant castration in premenopausal women 
however in spite of the fact that frequency of objective remission was superimposable 30 in both er groups regardless of treatment administered and site s of first involvement the disease in er tumors had amore indolent course while er tumors showed further progression within a few months 
the 5 yr results of the present study are now sufficiently mature to indicate with confidence that 6 cycles of cmf are equivalent to 12 cycles in terms of rfs and total survival 
regardless of the type of treatment rfs and overall survival were correlated with the presence er or absence er of estrogen receptors in the primary tumor 
the first and most important one is that there appears to be no real difference following adjuvant chemotherapy namely cmf between the rfs of pre versus postmenopausal women cmf 12 59 3 versus 57 6 cmf 6 66 5 versus 63 1 respectively 
the presence of specifically multidrug resistant phenotypes limits the therapeutic effectiveness of a single combination and renders its prolonged administration unnecessary 
these results as well as those reported in similar studies suggest that the multimodality approach with cyclical combination chemotherapy is indeed an important advance in the strategy of primary management of resectable breast cancer and therefore it is worthy of more widespread consideration 
patterns of first treatment failure were not different in the two series and regardless of treatment instituted upon relapse frequency of objective remissions were similar between the two groups followed by short lived remissions in er tumors while er tumors tended to show slow growing disease 
myelosuppression represented the dose limiting factor in the large majority of patients 70 80 but severe leukopenia and or thrombocytopenia were rare 10 and prolonged myelosuppression beyond the fourth week from drug discontinuation was never observed 
as can be seen the relative frequency ranged between0 5 for the 6 cycle group and 1 7 for the control group of the previous series 
the dose schedule of cmf was as follows cyclophosphamide ctx 100 mg sq m by mouth from day 1 to day 14 methotrexate mtx 40 mg sq m intravenously on days 1 and 8 and fluorouracil fu 600 mg sq m intravenously on days 1 and 8 
the importance of the level of doses administered has been detailed in one of our previous reports 4 a similar type of analysis was performed on patients entered into this study 
the majority of our patients 62 had less than 3 nodes involved and in half of the women tumors ranged between 2 and 5 cm on pathologic measurement 
in one patient of the 6 cycle group endometrial carcinoma in situ was documented within 16 mo from mastectomy 3 patients in the 12 cycle group developed endometrial carcinoma thyroid cancer and myoblastoma respectively and in all patients second neoplasms were diagnosed between 46 and 49 mo from mastectomy 
another important finding to be considered is the pattern of new disease manifestations where no differencein the frequency of local regional and or distant areas was evident between the two treatment groups 
one of them is the dose level of cmf the importance of which has been extensively evaluated in a recent publication 
in fact there was no striking difference in the pattern of new disease manifestations between er and er tumors since visceral involvement was documented in 31 2 and 35 3 respectively of relapsed patients 
in the absence of symptoms physical examination was performed once a month during the first year following mastectomy then every 3 mo during the second and third years and every 4 6 mo thereafter 
in conclusion the 5 yr results of our randomized study confirm that cmf particularly when delivered at nearly full doses can indeed alter the postoperative course of breast cancer with positive axillary nodes
