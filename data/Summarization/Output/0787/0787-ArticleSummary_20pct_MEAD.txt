Rectal cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases with 11 500 cases diagnosed in the UK in 1994 alone. In an attempt to increase the rate of curative resection and hence survival several trials have investigated the role of preoperative radiotherapy in treatment of rectal cancer. These doses of radiation were chosen after trials by the Veterans Administration Surgical Adjuvant Group and the Princess Margaret Hospital Toronto suggested survival advantage with radiotherapy for patients with tumours of Dukes stage C. Despite the suggestion of a real biological effect of the radiotherapy in the first MRC trial with significant changes in tumour stage no advantage was found for either radiotherapy group over the control group in terms of disease recurrence or survival. The importance of fixity was reflected in the survival pattern 5-year survival for fixed or partially fixed tumours was just 29 compared with 48 for mobile tumours. In 1981 the MRC began this trial of a higher dose of preoperative radiotherapy in patients with fixed or partially fixed tumours of the rectum who were thought to be suitable for abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection. Recruitment into the trial started in November 1981 and ended in November 1989 when 279 patients had been enrolled 140 patients were allocated surgery alone and 139 preoperative radiotherapy figure 1. Pretreatment characteristics of the patients were well balanced table 1. 69 49 of 140 patients allocated surgery only had partially fixed tumours and 71 51 had fixed tumours. Of the 139 patients who had radiotherapy and surgery 69 50 had fixed tumours and 70 50 had fixed tumours. The median time from randomisation to surgery was 7 days IQR 4.12 days for patients allocated immediate surgery and 73 days 64.84 for those allocated preoperative radiotherapy. Of patients allocated radiotherapy 73 55 were found to have no residual disease compared with 66 48 of the patients who had surgery alone. Of patients allocated surgery alone 56 40 of 140 were thought to have had curative operations compared with 66 47 of 139 patients allocated radiotherapy p0.21. Nine patients allocated preoperative radiotherapy did not have surgery-seven were not fit one patient refused and one was not referred back after radiotherapy. Again there was no evidence of an increased number of late complications in the radiotherapy group two patients in each treatment group still had complications of the abdominal wounds 12 months after surgery. Among those who had abdominoperineal excision four of 49 patients who had surgery alone who were assessable at 12 months had complications of the perineal wound compared with seven of 56 patients allocated radiotherapy. Complications associated with the colostomy were reported in ten surgery alone patients and eight radiotherapy patients and five patients in each group had anastomosis-related complications after anterior restorative resection.  Figure 2 shows Kaplan-Meier curves for time free of local recurrence. 65 patients allocated surgery alone had a recurrence compared with 50 of those allocated radiotherapy. Survival free of distant recurrence is also shown in figure 2. 67 patients allocated surgery alone had a distant recurrence compared with 49 of those allocated radiotherapy. Consistent with the results of the individual endpoints results for disease-free survival also suggest a benefit to the radiotherapy patients hazard ratio 0.76 0.58-1.0 log-rank p0.05. Disease recurrence or death within 5 years occurred in 108 patients allocated surgery alone and 96 of those allocated radiotherapy. Of the 279 patients randomised 217 have died 114 81 of 140 patients allocated surgery alone and 103 74 of 139 patients allocated radiotherapy median survival times are 24 months and 31 months respectively. Fewer deaths were reported to have been from colorectal cancer or complications of the disease or its treatment among patients allocated preoperative radiotherapy than among those allocated surgery alone 85 vs 103 hazard ratio 0.71 0.54-0.97 p0.02. This estimate indicates a substantial decrease in the risk of death from colorectal cancer in patients allocated radiotherapy although the data are compatible with a halving of the risk of death from colorectal cancer at one extreme or as little as 3 reduction in risk at the other.
