In an attempt to increase the rate of curative resection and hence survival, several trials have investigated the role of preoperative radiotherapy in treatment of rectal cancer. Patients and methods. 

Patients then proceeded to immediate surgery or to radiotherapy followed by surgery after a minimum of 4 weeks.  

Recruitment into the trial started in November, 1981, and ended in November, 1989, when 279 patients had been enrolled; 140 patients were allocated surgery alone and 139 preoperative radiotherapy (figure 1). This ongoing trial includes randomisation with respect to preoperative radiotherapy for rectal tumours. 

Of the 279 patients, 217 died. 69 (49%) of 140 patients allocated surgery only had partially fixed tumours and 71 (51%) had fixed tumours. Of the 139 patients who had radiotherapy and surgery 69 (50%) had fixed tumours and 70 (50%) had fixed tumours. 125 (90%) patients received the planned dose of 40 Gy over 4 weeks. Of patients who received radiotherapy, 61 (45%) of 137 reported no significant morbidity. 45 (33%) of all patients suffered diarrhoea and 30 (22%) had skin reactions. The median time from randomisation to surgery was 7 days (IQR 4.12 days) for patients allocated immediate surgery and 73 days (64.84) for those allocated preoperative radiotherapy. Of patients allocated radiotherapy, 73 (55%) were found to have no residual disease, compared with 66 (48%) of the patients who had surgery alone. Of patients allocated surgery alone, 56 (40%) of 140 were thought to have had curative operations compared with 66 (47%) of 139 patients allocated radiotherapy (p=0.21). 

Three patients allocated surgery alone were considered unfit for surgery. Nine patients allocated preoperative radiotherapy did not have surgery-seven were not fit, one patient refused, and one was not referred back after radiotherapy. 

Pathological assessment of the resected tissue was done for patients from both treatment groups (table 4). 

Tumours were significantly smaller in the radiotherapy group (Mann-Whitney, p.0.0001). Again, there was no evidence of an increased number of late complications in the radiotherapy group, two patients in each treatment group still had complications of the abdominal wounds 12 months after surgery. Complications associated with the colostomy were reported in ten surgery alone patients and eight radiotherapy patients, and five patients in each group had anastomosis-related complications after anterior restorative resection. 

65 patients allocated surgery alone had a recurrence compared with 50 of those allocated radiotherapy. 67 patients allocated surgery alone had a distant recurrence compared with 49 of those allocated radiotherapy. Consistent with the results of the individual endpoints, results for disease-free survival also suggest a benefit to the radiotherapy patients (hazard ratio 0.76 [0.58-1.0], log-rank p=0.05). Disease recurrence or death within 5 years occurred in 108 patients allocated surgery alone and 96 of those allocated radiotherapy. 

Of the 279 patients randomised, 217 have died; 114 (81%) of 140 patients allocated surgery alone and 103 (74%) of 139 patients allocated radiotherapy, median survival times are 24 months and 31 months, respectively. The hazard ratio for death from any cause is 0.79, giving an estimated reduction in the risk of death for patients allocated radiotherapy of 21% (log-rank p=0.10). Fewer deaths were reported to have been from colorectal cancer or complications of the disease or its treatment among patients allocated preoperative radiotherapy than among those allocated surgery alone (85 vs 103; hazard ratio 0.71 [0.54-0.97], p=0.02). There was evidence of benefit from preoperative radiotherapy before the trial. There were significant reductions in tumour size and grade and in the rates of local recurrence and distant metastases in the radiotherapy group. The trial was aimed at a specific disease subgroup - patients with locally advanced but otherwise operable rectal cancer (defined in the first MRC trial as fixed or partially fixed). Since the trial was closed, surgeons have been entering patients in large numbers into the AXIS trial in which there is randomisation with respect to preoperative radiation for patients with rectal cancer, with the Swedish model of short, high-dose therapy.
