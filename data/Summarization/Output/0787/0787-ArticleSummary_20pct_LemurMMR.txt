the reasons for investigating preoperative radiation therapy were reduction in size of the primary tumour and frequency of regional node metastases before resection a reduction in the frequency of local pelvic recurrence and of distant metastasis from cancer cells released during resection preoperative treatment can inhibit the proliferation of malignant cells whether they remain local or spread outside the pelvis after radiation radiation responsiveness of cancer cells may be greater before surgery when they are normally oxygenated than afterwards when they may be hypoxic because of surgical effects on the vasculature and a lower frequency of late radiation enteritis because the small bowel is less likely to be adherent in the pelvis 
eligible patients were men or women younger than 80 years who had histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum partially or totally fixed within the pelvis with the lower margin of the tumour within 15 cm of the anal verge were deemed suitable and fit for the proposed treatment and available for regular follow up were free of disseminated disease confirmed by clinical and radiological examination and had had no previous malignant disease 
this estimate indicates a substantial decrease in the risk of death from colorectal cancer in patients allocated radiotherapy although the data are compatible with a halving of the risk of death from colorectal cancer at one extreme or as little as 3 reduction in risk at the other 
rectal cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases with 11 500 cases diagnosed in the uk in 1994 alone 
for the analyses the date of first local recurrence was taken as the date of the first new clinical or histological evidence of local recurrence we included an assessment of clinical evidence of local recurrence at death 
we decided to continue the trial only until the launch in november 1989 of the uk coordinating committee on cancer research ukcccr adjuvant x ray and fluorouracil infusion study axis for treatment of colorectal cancer 
in an attempt to increase the rate of curative resection and hence survival several trials have investigated the role of preoperative radiotherapy in treatment of rectal cancer 
despite the suggestion of a real biological effect of the radiotherapy in the first mrc trial with significant changes in tumour stage no advantage was found for either radiotherapy group over the control group in terms of disease recurrence or survival 
since the trial was closed surgeons have been entering patients in large numbers into the axis trial in which there is randomisation with respect to preoperative radiation for patients with rectal cancer with the swedish model of short high dose therapy 
the surviving patients were followed up for a minimum of 5 years with the exception of seven patients lost to follow up within 5 years of randomisation who could not be traced through the opcs and were censored at the date last known to be alive 
two parallel opposed fields 18 cm by 15 cm were positioned to cover the tumour with an adequate proximal margin normally 5 cm 20 daily fractions of 2 gy at the mid plane central axis of the volume of the tumour were given over 4 weeks 
whereas surgeons showed little reluctance to accept the 2 weeks of low dose radiation of the first trial especially because there was no requirement for further delay before the operation they were reluctant to allow their patients to be open to what they saw as the risks of delayed surgical treatment in this trial 
the combined evidence from all these trials should yield sufficient numbers to answer precisely the questions of the effect of preoperative radiotherapy on local and distant recurrence and above all the effect on survival 
however the trial did demonstrate the importance of fixity as a prognostic factor 80 of mobile tumours had apparently curative resections compared with 50 of partially fixed and 30 of fixed tumours 
the proportion of tumours graded as dukes c was significantly lower in the radiotherapy group than in the surgery alone group 29 vs 59 p 0 0002 and the number of involved lymph nodes was also smaller 
criteria for suspicion of local recurrence were pain increasing in severity and requiring medication or disturbance of bladder function induration in the perineum or pelvis on examination or palpation of a mass in the pelvis or at the anastomosis 
the effects of radiotherapy on recurrence of cancer and survival are similar to the estimates on which the trial design was based 
failure to recruit the planned number of patients is reflected in the wide 95 ci seen for each of the main endpoints 
although less than two thirds of the planned sample size was achieved 217 86 of the 251 deaths anticipated if the planned 450 patients had been entered and followed up for 3 years have occurred 
recruitment initially steady declined after publication and perhaps misinterpretation of the disappointing results of the first mrc trial of low dose radiotherapy 
again there was no evidence of an increased number of late complications in the radiotherapy group two patients in each treatment group still had complications of the abdominal wounds 12 months after surgery 
the hazard ratio is 0 68 95 ci of 0 47 0 98 which suggests that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by a third 
the first uk medical research council mrc trial of preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer was a three arm randomised trial with 824 patients comparing a control surgery alone group with a group treated with 20 gy given in 10 equal fractions and another treated with a single exposure of 5 gy 
at each visit the status of the abdominal and perineal wounds was assessed late complications of treatment recorded and evidence of local or distant recurrence noted
