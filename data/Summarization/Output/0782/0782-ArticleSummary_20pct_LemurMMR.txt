two as yet unpublished meta analyses of all randomised trials comparing portal adjuvant chemotherapy with a no treatment control group have been conducted by the european organization on research and treatment of cancer and the oxford colorectal cancer cooperative group 
adjuvant chemotherapy of colorectal cancer has been tested in several randomised trials 
however none of the studies couldc onfirm the statistically significant overall effect on the frequency of liver metastases reported by taylor et al it seems likely that the effect of adjuvant portal chemotherapy on overall and disease free survival can be attributed to the systemic effects of intraportal fluorouracil which lead to a reduction in all tumour relapses ie local recurrences liver metastases and other distant metastases 
more evidence has emerged lately however that adjuvant chemotherapy of colon cancer may be beneficial 
after median follow up of 8 years we were notable to confirm the overall reduction of liver metastases reported by taylor et al we did find however a consistent reduction of all kinds of tumour recurrences that resulted in a significant advantage in overall survival and disease free survival for patients treated with adjuvant portal infusion confirming previous findings 
previous investigations with the exception of one have shown improvements in overall and disease free survival and a reduction in the frequency of liver recurrences especially in the subgroups of colon cancer patients and of those with tumour involved regional lymph nodes dukes c 
this trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase survival in patients with colorectal cancer 
this low incidence of surgical complications suggests advances in surgical technique and in patient management before and after elective cancer surgery that allow safe use of adjuvant chemotherapy soon after surgical intervention 
based on previous results and our own findings the swiss group for clinical cancer research decided to accept perioperative adjuvant chemotherapy as the standard treatment for further clinical trials in colorectal cancer 
intraportal injection of cytotoxic agents at the time of surgery for colorectal cancer was advocated in 1957 to prevent liver metastases 
liver metastases are observed at diagnosis of primary colorectal cancer in 25 30 of patients 
adjuvant chemotherapy reduced the risk of recurrence by 21 and the risk of death by 26 
the distribution of site of first relapse is given in terms of simple proportions since the two treatment groups had equal lengths of follow up 
although chemotherapy was started immediately after surgery it had no significant effect on rates of wound infection peritonitis or breakdown of bowel anastomosis 
deaths attributable to portal adjuvant chemotherapy have been reported in at least three trials 1 in taylor et al s study due to perirectal sepsis 1 in fielding and colleagues study a patient more than 80 years old and 1 in our trial an insulin dependent diabetic man who had gram negative septicaemia and leucopenia during portal infusion 
among the patients assigned chemotherapy 69 4 received at least 80 of the prescribed dose of fluorouracil 75 1 received at least 50 and 78 4 at least 25 
the swiss group for clinical cancer research sakk started one of these trials in 1981 to investigate the effectiveness of a perioperative intraportal cytotoxic regimen with fluorouracil and mitomycin 
the infusion group had a higher rate of repeat laparotomy and haemorrhage than the control group especially after abdominoperineal resection of rectal cancer 
hazard ratios were derived from a proportional hazards regression model with stratification for localisation of the tumour colon vs rectum and with covariates for nodal status positive vs negative and age four groups defined by the 25th 50th and 75th percentiles of the age distribution of the evaluable patients namely 57 63 and 69 years
