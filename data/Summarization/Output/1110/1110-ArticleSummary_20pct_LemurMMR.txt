fifteen patients 4 percent six in the combined therapy group and nine in the radiotherapy group were subsequently disqualified because of failure to undergo the required evaluation of para aortic lymph nodes eight patients the presence of extrapelvic cancer two the presence of a rare histologic subtype one the presence of a stage ib1 tumor with no involvement of pelvic nodes one the absence of pretreatment data two and receipt of chemotherapy before radiotherapy one 
of the estimated 13 700 women in the united states in whom invasive cervical cancer was diagnosed in 1998 nearly 5000 will ultimately die of the disease because of the inadequacies of current treatment 
disease free survival was also compared in the two groups and was calculated from the date of study entry to the date of the first occurrence of disease progression a second diagnosis of cancer or death from any cause or if none of these events occurred to the date of the last follow up visit 
overall survival was the primary end point for the comparison of the two treatments and was calculated from the date of study entry until the date of death or the date of the last follow up visit 
despite these criticisms the resultsof that study and those of trials assessing concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy for other tumors stimulated studies of the effects of radiotherapy and various combinations of fluorouracil cisplatin mitomycin carboplatin and paclitaxel as treatments for locally advanced cervical cancer the results of these trials have been encouraging but mostclinicians have not found them sufficiently convincing to justify the inclusion of chemotherapy in the routine treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer 
although the group reported significant improvements in overall and disease free survival with the addition of hydroxyurea therapy the study has been criticized for the use of a low dose of radiation and the poor survival rates in both groups and because more than half of the 190 patients who were enrolled could not be evaluated 
toxicity was assessed at the time of each evaluation with use of the cooperative group common toxicity criteria the acute radiation morbidity scoring criteria and the late radiation morbidity scoring scheme of the rtog and the european organization for research and treatment of cancer 
within 16 hours after the first radiation fraction was administered patients in the combination therapy group received the first cycle of chemotherapy which consisted of an intravenous infusion of 75 mg of cisplatin per square meter of body surface area over a 4 hour period followed by an intravenous infusion of 4000 mg of fluorouracil per square meter over a 96 hour period 
we enrolled women of all ages who had stages iib through iva squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix according to the staging system of the international federation of gynecology and obstetrics table 1 or stage ib or iia of one of these cancers with a tumor diameter of at least 5 cm or biopsy proved metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes 
the rates of distant relapse were 14 percent in the combined therapy group and 33 percent in the radiotherapy group p 0 001 with a relative risk of relapse of 0 39 95 percent confidence interval 0 24 to 0 63 in the combined therapy group 
the rate of locoregional recurrences was 19 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 35 percent in the radiotherapy group p 0 001 with a relative risk of locoregional recurrences of 0 47 95 percent confidence interval 0 31 to 0 71 in the combined therapy group 
radiotherapy was delivered according to the protocol or with minor deviations in 83 percent of the patients in the combined therapy group and 84 percent of those in the radiotherapy group 
reports by rose et al and keys et al in this issue of the journal strengthen the body of evidence supporting the use of combined therapy in women with advanced cervical cancer 
of these 147 patients in the combined therapy group 76 percent and 122 patients in the radiotherapy group 63 percent were alive at the time of the last analysis 
in the united states cervical cancer disproportionately affects women who are members of minority groups and women of low socioeconomic status partly because such women tend to have insufficient access to and knowledge of screening programs for cervical cancer 
the radiation dose was keyed to the central ray at the patient s midplane for anteroposterior posteroanterior fields or to the isocenter of the beams 
the suggested maximal doses to the bladder the rectum and the lateral surface of the vagina were 75 70 and 130 gy respectively 
the 388 remaining patients 195 in the combined therapy group and 193 in the radiotherapy group form the basis of this analysis 
at the interim analysis conducted in july 1998 after the enrollment goal was met the difference between the two groups was determined to have met the requirements for early reporting 
on the basis of the results of two earlier rtog trials we predicted that the five year survival rate for the control group radiotherapy alone would be 65 percent for patients with stage ib or ii disease and 40 percent for patients with stage iii or iva disease 
brachytherapy was performed within two weeks preferably less than one week after the completion of pelvic radiation with the goal of keeping the total duration of treatment under eight weeks when possible 
the importance of this third cycle is uncertain but because close to 25 percentof the total paracentral dose of radiation is delivered with each intracavitary procedure the addition of concurrent chemotherapy during this time may be important 
we are not the first to investigate the role of concomitant chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer 
for patients with stage iii or iva disease the five year disease free survival rates were 58 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 38 percent in the radiotherapy group p 0 13 
follow up data were available for 193 of the 195 patients in the combined therapy group and for all 193 patients in the radiotherapy group 
the acute side effects were severe possibly because of the addition of chemotherapy or the altered regimen of fractionation 
for patients who were assigned to receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy the treatment field extended from the space between l4 and l5 to the midpubis or to a line 4 cm below the most distal vaginal or cervical site of disease 
five year rates of secondary end points such as locoregional recurrence para aortic recurrence and distant metastasis were estimated with the use of cumulative incidence methods and treatment effects were tested with use of the gray algorithm 
a 33 percent reduction in the death rate as a result of chemotherapy would yield an absolute improvement of approximately 10 percent in the five year survival rate
