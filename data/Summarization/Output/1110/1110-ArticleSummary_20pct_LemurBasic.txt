of the estimated 13 700 women in the united states in whom invasive cervical cancer was diagnosed in 1998 nearly 5000 will ultimately die of the disease because of the inadequacies of current treatment 
in the united states cervical cancer disproportionately affects women who are members of minority groups and women of low socioeconomic status partly because such women tend to have insufficient access to and knowledge of screening programs for cervical cancer 
in 1990 the radiation therapy oncology group rtog began a randomized clinical trial to compare the effects on survival of treatment with extended field radiation and treatment with pelvic radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in patients with cervical cancer 
we enrolled women of all ages who had stages iib through iva squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix according to the staging system of the international federation of gynecology and obstetrics table 1 or stage ib or iia of one of these cancers with a tumor diameter of at least 5 cm or biopsy proved metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes 
women were excluded from the study if they met any of the following criteria disease outside the pelvic area or spread to para aortic lymph nodes a prior cancer other than cutaneous basal cell carcinoma medical contraindications to chemotherapy a rare histologic subtype and prior hysterectomy or transperitoneal staging procedure for cervical cancer pelvic radiotherapy or systemic chemotherapy 
the patients in each treatment group were stratified according to the tumor stage ib iia or iib vs iii or iva and the staging method used for para aortic lymph nodes clinical vs surgical 
external beam radiation was delivered with anteroposterior and posteroanterior opposed beams of at least 15 mv photons or the use of four fields anteroposterior posteroanterior and two lateral fields of at least 4 mv photons 
for patients who were assigned to receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy the treatment field extended from the space between l4 and l5 to the midpubis or to a line 4 cm below the most distal vaginal or cervical site of disease 
custom shielding was designed to treat the pelvic lymph nodes with a margin of at least 1 to 1 5 cm for patients who were assigned to receive radiotherapy alone the pelvic and paraaortic areas were treated as a continuous area with a superiorfield border at the space between l1 and l2 
within 16 hours after the first radiation fraction was administered patients in the combination therapy group received the first cycle of chemotherapy which consisted of an intravenous infusion of 75 mg of cisplatin per square meter of body surface area over a 4 hour period followed by an intravenous infusion of 4000 mg of fluorouracil per square meter over a 96 hour period 
to avoid treatment delays intracavitary insertions were performed without chemotherapy if a patient had a granulocyte count of less than 1500 per cubic millimeter and a platelet count of less than 100 000 per cubic millimeter 
toxicity was assessed at the time of each evaluation with use of the cooperative group common toxicity criteria the acute radiation morbidity scoring criteria and the late radiation morbidity scoring scheme of the rtog and the european organization for research and treatment of cancer 
overall survival was the primary end point for the comparison of the two treatments and was calculated from the date of study entry until the date of death or the date of the last follow up visit 
disease free survival was also compared in the two groups and was calculated from the date of study entry to the date of the first occurrence of disease progression a second diagnosis of cancer or death from any cause or if none of these events occurred to the date of the last follow up visit 
five year rates of secondary end points such as locoregional recurrence para aortic recurrence and distant metastasis were estimated with the use of cumulative incidence methods and treatment effects were tested with use of the gray algorithm 
the study was initially designed to be able to detect a reduction of 33 percent in the annual death rate with a statistical power of 80 percent and a two sided significance level of 0 05 
on the basis of the results of two earlier rtog trials we predicted that the five year survival rate for the control group radiotherapy alone would be 65 percent for patients with stage ib or ii disease and 40 percent for patients with stage iii or iva disease 
the nominal significance level required for early reporting was origioriginally set at p 0 005 but we subsequently adopted a more conservative approach because it allowed the number of deaths observed to determine the nominal level required for early reporting 
fifteen patients 4 percent six in the combined therapy group and nine in the radiotherapy group were subsequently disqualified because of failure to undergo the required evaluation of para aortic lymph nodes eight patients the presence of extrapelvic cancer two the presence of a rare histologic subtype one the presence of a stage ib1 tumor with no involvement of pelvic nodes one the absence of pretreatment data two and receipt of chemotherapy before radiotherapy one 
although moderate grade 3 and severe grade 4 side effects occurred more frequently during or within 60 days after the completion of treatment with combined therapy than with radiotherapy alone these effects were usually self limited or resolved with medical management table 3 
kaplan meier analysis revealed that overall survival rates were significantly better among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy than among those treated with radiotherapy alone 73 percent vs 58 percent p 0 004 table 5 and fig 1 
the rates of distant relapse were 14 percent in the combined therapy group and 33 percent in the radiotherapy group p 0 001 with a relative risk of relapse of 0 39 95 percent confidence interval 0 24 to 0 63 in the combined therapy group 
the rate of locoregional recurrences was 19 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 35 percent in the radiotherapy group p 0 001 with a relative risk of locoregional recurrences of 0 47 95 percent confidence interval 0 31 to 0 71 in the combined therapy group 
there was no significant difference in overall survival between treatment groups among patients who had stage iii or iva disease although the study was not designed to have a sufficient number of patients in these subgroups to test for a statistically significant difference 
although the group reported significant improvements in overall and disease free survival with the addition of hydroxyurea therapy the study has been criticized for the use of a low dose of radiation and the poor survival rates in both groups and because more than half of the 190 patients who were enrolled could not be evaluated 
despite these criticisms the resultsof that study and those of trials assessing concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy for other tumors stimulated studies of the effects of radiotherapy and various combinations of fluorouracil cisplatin mitomycin carboplatin and paclitaxel as treatments for locally advanced cervical cancer the results of these trials have been encouraging but mostclinicians have not found them sufficiently convincing to justify the inclusion of chemotherapy in the routine treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer 
we used a higher dose of cisplatin 75 mg per square meter than that used with fluorouracil in the gynecologic oncology group studies and we also included a third cycle of chemotherapy during one of the intracavitary procedures 
the importance of this third cycle is uncertain but because close to 25 percentof the total paracentral dose of radiation is delivered with each intracavitary procedure the addition of concurrent chemotherapy during this time may be important 
in our study the benefit of para aortic radiation may have been less than that observed in an earlier rtog trial because our trial required more rigorous staging of para aortic lymph nodes and included patients with more advanced pelvic disease
