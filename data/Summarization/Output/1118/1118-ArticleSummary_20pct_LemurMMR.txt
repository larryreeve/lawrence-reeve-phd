over the past several decades the prognosis of patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix has been poor particularly for those with bulky local tumors and extensive parametrial extension 
the most likely explanation for the poor results in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group is the higher treatmentrelated toxicity and that could limit the dose of definitive radiation employed or interrupt the planned radiotherapy 
the concept of concurrent chemoradiotherapy offers a number of theoretical advantages which produces no delay in the start of definitive radiotherapy no time gap to induce cross resistance and the possibility of eradication of subclinical metastasis 
at a two sided p value of 0 05 with the use of a pearson x2 approximation the estimated power was 80 an improvement of 25 in survival with the concurrent therapy at the a 0 05 level two sided test 
the concurrent use of radiation and chemotherapy either as a single agent or in combination has also been demonstrated to be effective in the local control of advanced carcinoma of the cervix with acceptable toxicity as presented by several reports and was also supported by our previous phase i and ii trial 
the mean age of the patients was 56 2 years range 33 68 years in the concurrent group and 58 7 years range 41 69 years in the radiotherapy group 
therefore the design of a more efficient treatment modality such as the addition of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with the objective of increasing tumor control and long term survival for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma is advocated 
an analysis of the patterns of failure reveals that the incidence of pelvic failure was equally distributed between the treatment groups 31 7 versus 30 6 p 0 93 
although the response rate of 88 4 following concurrent chemoradiotherapy in our study is very encouraging when compared with 74 3 of the radiotherapy group at the end of therapy this study does not provide evidence that chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone with respect to survival 
on the other hand a probable explanation for the poor survival in advanced cervical cancer patients in spite of a satisfactory rate of initial response may be the enhancement of accelerated tumor proliferation during treatment 
in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group chemotherapeutic regimens consisted of cisplatin 50 mg m2 body surface area intravenously at the rate of 1 mg min on day 1 vincristine 1 mg m2 intravenously push on day 2 and bleomycin 25 mg m2 body surface area intravenously infusion in divided doses on days 2 3 and 4 which were given starting on day 1 of radiotherapy and then every 3 weeks for a total of four courses 
the trial compared the efficacy and tolerability of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer 
of the 9 patients requiring treatment delays 7 patients 77 8 died of disease 5 or are alive with disease 2 whereas 18 of the 49 patients 36 7 who had completed their planned treatment without treatment delays died of disease or are alive with disease 
to further increase the systemic activity and the radiation enhancing potential of the chemotherapy we chose cisplatin based regimens with vincristine and bleomycin in this trial because it had proven high efficacy of local control in our previous phase i and ii trials for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma 
after a median follow up of 46 8 months the disease free survival and actuarial survival rates at 3 years for patients in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group were not statistically different compared with patients in the radiotherapy group 51 7 versus 53 2 p 0 92 and 61 7 versus 64 5 p 0 88 respectively 
over the past few years there have been multiple studies published which have retrospectively analyzed the outcome of patients with advanced cervical carcinoma who received concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy 
additionally there was also no difference in the incidence of distant failure between the chemoradiotherapy group and the radiotherapy group 21 6 versus 29 p 0 47 
of the radiotherapy group 60 patients completed radiotherapy with no delays of treatment for toxicity whereas the planned radiotherapy was interrupted for 1 week in 2 patients because of radiation protitis or neutropenia 
the duration of the unplanned interruption was 1 week in 5 and 2 weeks in 2 and 2 patients were unable to complete the planned radiotherapy 
the duration of therapy for the patients was 59 days range 49 78 days versus 51 days range 47 65 days in the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups respectively 
the patients had to have a white cell count of at least 3000 m3 and a platelet count of at least 100 000 m3 before the next course could be administered 
the rationale for adding chemotherapy to pelvic radiation is to provide systemic cytotoxic agents active against cervical cancer with the potential to enhance the radiosensitivity to enhance local tumor control and to eradicate micrometastasis 
therefore in an attempt to improve tumor control and survival in patients with advanced cervical carcinoma the treatment efficacy and tolerability of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy using cisplatin based chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer needs to be explored 
our results indicated that despite the excellent early tumor response seen during treatment the benefit of concurrent chemoradiation in terms of reduced mortality and increased pelvic control rates may not be as great as that suggested by other reports 
the problem of enhanced pelvic control cannot be approached simply by increasing radiation doses because of the additional complications produced by conventional radiation 
other eligibility criteria consisted of a pathologically verified squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix a karnofsky performance status index of 80 or above and an age of younger than 70 years 
the actuarial disease free survival and overall survival of patients with complete follow up were estimated by the life table method of kaplan and meier 
a tumor response was observed in 88 4 53 60 of the patients in concurrent group and in 74 2 46 62 of the patient s in radiotherapy group 
therefore to test the hypothesis of concurrent chemoradiotherapy improving the survival rate of advanced cervical cancer in 1990 we began a phase iii randomized trial comparing concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus pelvic radiation alone in patients with advanced cervical carcinoma at our institution 
therefore in patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix improvement in local control will not translate into an improved long term outcome because this gain will be offset by the eventual development of a relapse 
informed consents were obtained from all patients and the study protocol was approved by the protocol committee of chang gung memorial hospital
