over the past several decades the prognosis of patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix has been poor particularly for those with bulky local tumors and extensive parametrial extension 
while no therapy has been proven more effective than radical external beam plus intracavitary radiotherapy considerable research effort including addition of chemotherapy plus radiation is currently being put into improving survival rate in patients with advanced carcinoma of the cervix 
the rationale for adding chemotherapy to pelvic radiation is to provide systemic cytotoxic agents active against cervical cancer with the potential to enhance the radiosensitivity to enhance local tumor control and to eradicate micrometastasis 
the concurrent use of radiation and chemotherapy either as a single agent or in combination has also been demonstrated to be effective in the local control of advanced carcinoma of the cervix with acceptable toxicity as presented by several reports and was also supported by our previous phase i and ii trial 
other eligibility criteria consisted of a pathologically verified squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix a karnofsky performance status index of 80 or above and an age of younger than 70 years 
pretreatment evaluation included a complete medical history and physical examination complete blood count serum electrolytes chemistry profile tumor markers chest x ray an electrocardiogram and contrast enhanced computerized tomography ct of the abdomen and pelvis 
in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group chemotherapeutic regimens consisted of cisplatin 50 mg m2 body surface area intravenously at the rate of 1 mg min on day 1 vincristine 1 mg m2 intravenously push on day 2 and bleomycin 25 mg m2 body surface area intravenously infusion in divided doses on days 2 3 and 4 which were given starting on day 1 of radiotherapy and then every 3 weeks for a total of four courses 
the patients had to have a white cell count of at least 3000 m3 and a platelet count of at least 100 000 m3 before the next course could be administered 
at a two sided p value of 0 05 with the use of a pearson x2 approximation the estimated power was 80 an improvement of 25 in survival with the concurrent therapy at the a 0 05 level two sided test 
of the radiotherapy group 60 patients completed radiotherapy with no delays of treatment for toxicity whereas the planned radiotherapy was interrupted for 1 week in 2 patients because of radiation protitis or neutropenia 
the acute treatment related toxicity grade 3 or 4 appears to be higher with the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group when compared with radiation group 36 7 versus 17 7 p 0 02 
although there was no significant difference between the two compared groups with regard to treatment related late toxicity concurrent group 23 3 versus radiation group 12 9 p 0 13 a nonsignificant trend toward a higher rate of late toxicity in the chemoradiotherapy group is evident 
survival of the chemoradiotherapy group 31 patients 51 7 are alive without evidence of disease 6 10 remain alive with disease and 21 35 died of disease at 7 48 months 
of the 9 patients requiring treatment delays 7 patients 77 8 died of disease 5 or are alive with disease 2 whereas 18 of the 49 patients 36 7 who had completed their planned treatment without treatment delays died of disease or are alive with disease 
of the radiation group 33 patients 53 2 are alive without evidence of disease 7 11 3 remain alive with disease and 22 35 5 died of disease at 12 45 months 
after a median follow up of 46 8 months the disease free survival and actuarial survival rates at 3 years for patients in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group were not statistically different compared with patients in the radiotherapy group 51 7 versus 53 2 p 0 92 and 61 7 versus 64 5 p 0 88 respectively 
analysis by kaplan meier method showed that the actuarial survival was not statistically different between the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups mean survival time 38 1 months versus 41 5 months p 0 27 
therefore the design of a more efficient treatment modality such as the addition of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy with the objective of increasing tumor control and long term survival for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma is advocated 
therefore in an attempt to improve tumor control and survival in patients with advanced cervical carcinoma the treatment efficacy and tolerability of combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy using cisplatin based chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced cervical cancer needs to be explored 
the concept of concurrent chemoradiotherapy offers a number of theoretical advantages which produces no delay in the start of definitive radiotherapy no time gap to induce cross resistance and the possibility of eradication of subclinical metastasis 
the published trials in advanced cervical carcinoma with concurrent chemoradiotherapy either a single agent weekly cisplatin or in combination with cisplatin 5 fu or cisplatin bleomycin vincristine yield tumor response rates of approximately 80 and 3 year survival rates reached 50 to 60 of patients 
therefore to test the hypothesis of concurrent chemoradiotherapy improving the survival rate of advanced cervical cancer in 1990 we began a phase iii randomized trial comparing concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus pelvic radiation alone in patients with advanced cervical carcinoma at our institution 
to further increase the systemic activity and the radiation enhancing potential of the chemotherapy we chose cisplatin based regimens with vincristine and bleomycin in this trial because it had proven high efficacy of local control in our previous phase i and ii trials for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma 
although the response rate of 88 4 following concurrent chemoradiotherapy in our study is very encouraging when compared with 74 3 of the radiotherapy group at the end of therapy this study does not provide evidence that chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone with respect to survival 
our results indicated that despite the excellent early tumor response seen during treatment the benefit of concurrent chemoradiation in terms of reduced mortality and increased pelvic control rates may not be as great as that suggested by other reports 
the most likely explanation for the poor results in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group is the higher treatmentrelated toxicity and that could limit the dose of definitive radiation employed or interrupt the planned radiotherapy 
indeed in our trial the treatment related toxicity was severe and resulted in delayed radiotherapy in 15 of patients after chemoradiotherapy in which 77 8 of patients with treatment delays recurred or died of disease 
on the other hand a probable explanation for the poor survival in advanced cervical cancer patients in spite of a satisfactory rate of initial response may be the enhancement of accelerated tumor proliferation during treatment 
therefore in patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the cervix improvement in local control will not translate into an improved long term outcome because this gain will be offset by the eventual development of a relapse 
in conclusion when comparing patients with concurrent therapy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to radiotherapy alone our study showed that concurrent multiagent chemoradiotherapy did not prove to be a superior definitive therapy for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma 
it is desirable for future studies to see whether other chemotherapeutic regiments such as 5 fu or weekly cisplatin would be more likely to be tolerable and be associated with fewer treatment interruptions
