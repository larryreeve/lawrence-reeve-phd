cervical cancer is the second most frequent cancer among women worldwide and the most frequent cancer among women in africa asia and south america 
in the united states where screening for cervical cancer is readily available most women who are found to have cervical cancer were not screened regularly 
the ability of radiotherapy to cure locally advanced cervical cancer is limited by the size of the tumor because the doses required to treat large tumors exceed the limit of toxicity in normal tissue 
at the time we were developing the protocol used in the current study radiotherapy plus concomitant chemotherapy with hydroxyurea was the standard combined therapy regimen for advanced cervical cancer because an early analysis of the combination of radiation cisplatin and fluorouracil failed to show improved progression free survival 
thus because of the large difference in outcome among the treatment groups and the similarity between the rates of survival and progression free survival within each of the treatment groups this analysis is the final analysis of survival and progression free survival 
in the phase 3 study by morris et al whose results are reported in this issue of the journal radiotherapy in combination with treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil significantly improved the rates of disease free survival and overall survival among women with stage ib through iva cervical cancer 
the pelvic field extended from the upper margin of l5 to the midportion of the obturator foramen or the lowest level of disease with a 3 cm margin and laterally 1 5 to 2 cm beyond the lateral margins of the bony pelvic wall at least 7 cm from the midline 
as a result about 25 percent of patients with cervical cancer in the united states present with locally advanced disease stage iib through iva according to the staging system of the international federation of gynecology and obstetrics 
in addition the responses in phase 2 trials of this chemotherapy regimen with radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer and in patients with head and neck cancer were favorable 
the gynecologic oncology group has performed several prospective randomized studies of the effect of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in women with locally advanced cervical cancer 
women with untreated invasive squamous cell carcinoma adenosquamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the cervix of international federation of gynecology and obstetrics stage iib localized disease with parametrial involvement stage iii extension of the tumor to the pelvic wall or stage ivb involvement of the bladder or rectal mucosa were enrolled in the study from april 1992 to april 1997 
the median delay was 8 days the 10th percentile was a time 2 days ahead of schedule and the 90th percentile was a delay of 22 days in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy 10 days 10th and 90th percentiles 1 and 26 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea and 8 days 10th and 90th percentiles 1 day ahead of schedule and a delay of 23 days in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy 
in our study the duration of radiotherapy and the dose of radiation were similar among the three regimens implying that the differences in progression free survival and survival were related to the chemotherapy 
for the lateral fields the anterior border was the anterior border of the pubic symphysis and the posterior border was the space between s2 and s3 
because of its cytotoxic effect the drug reduces the bulk of tumors which leads to reoxygenation of the tumor and entry of the cells into a radiation sensitive phase of the cell cycle 
since the para aortic lymph nodes are often the first site of extrapelvic disease and involvement of these nodes was the most important prognostic factor in prior gynecologic oncology group trials only patients without involvement of the para aortic lymph nodes were included in our study 
the concurrent use of single drug and multiple drug regimens with radiotherapy has been tested in women with cervical cancer but combination therapy has not gained wide acceptance 
the number of patients who received within 15 percent of the prescribed total dose to both point a 69 to 93 gy and point b stage iib 47 to 63 gy stage iii or iva 51 to 59 gy was 159 90 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy 147 85 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea and 149 84 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy 
after adjustment for the clinical stage of disease the relative risk of death was 0 61 95 percent confidence interval 0 44 to 0 85 in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0 58 95 percent confidence interval 0 41 to 0 81 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy 
therefore we undertook a randomized study in which all women with locally advanced cervical cancer received local radiation as well as weekly concomitant treatment with cisplatin alone the combination of cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea or hydroxyurea alone 
progression free survival was calculated from the date of entry into the study to the date of the first physical or radiographic evidence of disease progression death or the last follow up visit 
the relative risk of progression of disease or death was 0 57 95 percent confidence interval 0 42 to 0 78 in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0 55 95 percent confidence interval 0 40 to 0 75 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy after adjustment for the clinical stage of disease 
the total dose delivered to point a a reference location 2 cm lateral and 2 cm superior to the cervical os was 80 8 gy in patients with stage iib and 81 0 gy in patients with stage iii or iva disease the total dose delivered to point b the pelvic wall was 55 0 gy in patients with stage iib disease and 60 0 gy in patients with stage iii or iva disease 
our results demonstrate the superiority of radiotherapy and chemotherapy either with cisplatin alone or with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer stage iib iii or iva without metastasis to the para aortic lymph nodes 
however in a small study of 45 patients with cervical cancer radiotherapy and chemotherapy with cisplatin 25 mg per square meter per week increased the rate of local control by 35 percent p 0 025 for the comparison with radiotherapy alone but there was no long term improvement in survival 
survival was calculated from the date of entry into the study to the date of death or the last follow up visit 
each patient was required to undergo a complete physical examination a pelvic examination under anesthesia chest radiography and intravenous pyelography or abdominal computed tomography to determine the clinical stage of the cancer 
we calculated the target sample size of 165 patients for each regimen on the basis of an ability to detect a 35 percent decrease in the rate of disease progression with the use of either radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin or radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea 
the length of delays in radiotherapy in days was calculated by subtracting the planned duration of radiotherapy the number of prescribed fractions plus 2 weekend days for every five fractions plus 10 days for each implant from the actual duration of radiotherapy
