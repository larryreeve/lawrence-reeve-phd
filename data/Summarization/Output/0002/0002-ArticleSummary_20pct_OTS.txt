 Radiotherapy combined with treatment with hydroxyurea has been compared in separate trials with radiotherapy alone, with radiotherapy and concomitant therapy with misonidazole, and with radiotherapy and concomitant treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil (and Whitney CW: unpublished data). As compared with radiotherapy alone, treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy significantly increased the rate of complete response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. As compared with treatment with misonidazole and radiotherapy, treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy increased progression-free survival and was less toxic. However, treatment with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and radiotherapy resulted in greater improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival than did treatment with hydroxyurea and radiotherapy (Whitney CW: unpublished data). The length of delays in radiotherapy, in days, was calculated by subtracting the planned duration of radiotherapy (the number of prescribed fractions plus 2 weekend days for every five fractions plus 10 days for each implant) from the actual duration of radiotherapy.   We calculated the target sample size of 165 patients for each regimen on the basis of an ability to detect a 35 percent decrease in the rate of disease progression with the use of either radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin or radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea. 173 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea;  The relative risk of progression of disease or death was 0.57 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.42 to 0.78) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0.55 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.75) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea, as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy, after adjustment for the clinical stage of disease. After adjustment for these five factors, the relative risks of disease progression for the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea were extremely close (relative risks, 0.58 and 0.55, respectively) to the estimates obtained after adjustment for clinical stage of disease alone. 64 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea; 57 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea; After adjustment for the clinical stage of disease, the relative risk of death was 0.61 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.85) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0.58 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.41 to 0.81) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea, as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy.  Patients in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea had less local progression (19 percent and 20 percent, respectively) than those in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy (30 percent). 147 (85 percent) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea;   The median duration of treatment was 9.0 weeks (10th and 90th percentiles, 7.1 and 11.9, respectively) in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy; 9.3 weeks (10th and 90th percentiles, 7.6 and 11.6) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea; 10 days (10th and 90th percentiles, 1 and 26) in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea; The frequencies of other hematologic effects of both grade 3 and grade 4 - predominantly granulocytopenia - in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea therapy were approximately double those in the other two groups (P<0.001).  We found higher rates of survival and progression-free survival among patients who were treated with radiotherapy and either cisplatin alone or cisplatin, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea than among patients who were treated with radiotherapy and hydroxyurea alone. However, in a small study of 45 patients with cervical cancer, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with cisplatin (25 mg per square meter per week) increased the rate of local control by 35 percent (P<0.025 for the comparison with radiotherapy alone), but there was no long-term improvement in survival. In the phase 3 study by Morris et al., whose results are reported in this issue of the Journal, radiotherapy in combination with treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil significantly improved the rates of disease-free survival and overall survival among women with stage IB through IVA cervical cancer.   Our results demonstrate the superiority of radiotherapy and chemotherapy either with cisplatin alone or with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (stage IIB, III, or IVA without metastasis to the para-aortic lymph nodes).
