at the time we were developing the protocol used in the current study radiotherapy plus concomitant chemotherapy with hydroxyurea was the standard combined therapy regimen for advanced cervical cancer because an early analysis of the combination of radiation cisplatin and fluorouracil failed to show improved progression free survival 
women with untreated invasive squamous cell carcinoma adenosquamous carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the cervix of international federation of gynecology and obstetrics stage iib localized disease with parametrial involvement stage iii extension of the tumor to the pelvic wall or stage ivb involvement of the bladder or rectal mucosa were enrolled in the study from april 1992 to april 1997 
patients were required to have a gynecologic oncology group performance status of 0 1 2 or 3 equivalent to karnofsky performance scores of 90 or 100 70 or 80 50 or 60 and 30 or 40 respectively and to have no history of other cancers 
other eligibility criteria were as follows a leukocyte count of at least 3000 per cubic millimeter a platelet count of at least 100 000 per cubic millimeter a serum creatinine level of no more than 2 0 mg per deciliter 177 umol per liter a serum bilirubin level that was no more than 1 5 times the upper limit of normal at the institution where it was measured and a serum aspartate aminotransferase level that was no more than 3 times the upper limit of normal at the institution where it was measured 
the total dose delivered to point a a reference location 2 cm lateral and 2 cm superior to the cervical os was 80 8 gy in patients with stage iib and 81 0 gy in patients with stage iii or iva disease the total dose delivered to point b the pelvic wall was 55 0 gy in patients with stage iib disease and 60 0 gy in patients with stage iii or iva disease 
the pelvic field extended from the upper margin of l5 to the midportion of the obturator foramen or the lowest level of disease with a 3 cm margin and laterally 1 5 to 2 cm beyond the lateral margins of the bony pelvic wall at least 7 cm from the midline 
the length of delays in radiotherapy in days was calculated by subtracting the planned duration of radiotherapy the number of prescribed fractions plus 2 weekend days for every five fractions plus 10 days for each implant from the actual duration of radiotherapy 
treatment with hydroxyurea or fluorouracil was discontinued if the leukocyte count dropped below 3000 per cubic millimeter or the platelet count dropped below 100 000 per cubic millimeter and it was resumed once the counts rose above these levels 
treatment with cisplatin was discontinued if the leukocyte count dropped below 2500 per cubic millimeter or the platelet count dropped below 50 000 per cubic millimeter and it was resumed once the counts rose above these levels 
we calculated the target sample size of 165 patients for each regimen on the basis of an ability to detect a 35 percent decrease in the rate of disease progression with the use of either radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin or radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea 
thus because of the large difference in outcome among the treatment groups and the similarity between the rates of survival and progression free survival within each of the treatment groups this analysis is the final analysis of survival and progression free survival 
from april 1992 to april 1997 575 patients were enrolled 192 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin 191 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea and 192 were assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy with hydroxyurea 
forty nine of these patients 9 percent were subsequently found to be ineligible for the following reasons because of deviations from the surgical protocol for the evaluation of para aortic lymph nodes 44 patients ineligible stage of disease 2 metastasis to para aortic lymph nodes 1 incorrect primary diagnosis 1 and incomplete pretreatment testing 1 
thus a total of 526 patients were included in the analysis 176 in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy 173 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea and 177 in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy 
the relative risk of progression of disease or death was 0 57 95 percent confidence interval 0 42 to 0 78 in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0 55 95 percent confidence interval 0 40 to 0 75 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy after adjustment for the clinical stage of disease 
a multiple regression analysis of progression free survival was performed that included the prognostic variables identified by stehman et al clinical stage of disease tumor size as assessed by physical examination status of pelvic lymph nodes age at diagnosis and performance status 
after adjustment for these five factors the relative risks of disease progression for the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea were extremely close relative risks 0 58 and 0 55 respectively to the estimates obtained after adjustment for clinical stage of disease alone 
the rates of progression free survival at 24 months were 67 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy 64 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea and 47 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy 
a total of 205 patients have died 39 percent 59 in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy 57 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea and 89 in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy 
after adjustment for the clinical stage of disease the relative risk of death was 0 61 95 percent confidence interval 0 44 to 0 85 in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and 0 58 95 percent confidence interval 0 41 to 0 81 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea as compared with the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy 
patients in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy and the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea had less local progression 19 percent and 20 percent respectively than those in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy 30 percent 
the number of patients who received within 15 percent of the prescribed total dose to both point a 69 to 93 gy and point b stage iib 47 to 63 gy stage iii or iva 51 to 59 gy was 159 90 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy 147 85 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea and 149 84 percent in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy 
the median duration of treatment was 9 0 weeks 10th and 90th percentiles 7 1 and 11 9 respectively in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy 9 3 weeks 10th and 90th percentiles 7 6 and 11 6 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea and 8 9 weeks 10th and 90th percentiles 7 2 and 11 2 in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy 
the median delay was 8 days the 10th percentile was a time 2 days ahead of schedule and the 90th percentile was a delay of 22 days in the group given radiotherapy combined with cisplatin therapy 10 days 10th and 90th percentiles 1 and 26 in the group given radiotherapy combined with treatment with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea and 8 days 10th and 90th percentiles 1 day ahead of schedule and a delay of 23 days in the group given radiotherapy combined with hydroxyurea therapy 
since the para aortic lymph nodes are often the first site of extrapelvic disease and involvement of these nodes was the most important prognostic factor in prior gynecologic oncology group trials only patients without involvement of the para aortic lymph nodes were included in our study 
however in a small study of 45 patients with cervical cancer radiotherapy and chemotherapy with cisplatin 25 mg per square meter per week increased the rate of local control by 35 percent p 0 025 for the comparison with radiotherapy alone but there was no long term improvement in survival 
in a phase 3 trial conducted by the gynecologic oncology group 388 patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy either with cisplatin and fluorouracil or with hydroxyurea whitney cw unpublished data the two drug regimen improved survival relative risk of death 0 74 95 percent confidence interval 0 58 to 0 95 
in the phase 3 study by morris et al whose results are reported in this issue of the journal radiotherapy in combination with treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil significantly improved the rates of disease free survival and overall survival among women with stage ib through iva cervical cancer 
our results demonstrate the superiority of radiotherapy and chemotherapy either with cisplatin alone or with cisplatin fluorouracil and hydroxyurea in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer stage iib iii or iva without metastasis to the para aortic lymph nodes
