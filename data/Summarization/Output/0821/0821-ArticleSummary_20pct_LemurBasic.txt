the two drugs have been used together clinically on empirical grounds for some time particularly in the treatment of breast cancer but data from experimental tumors in vivo and in vitro document both synergistic and antagonistic interactions 
sequential administration of moderate doses of mtx followed by 5 fu has been reported effective in advanced head and neck cancer and colorectal cancer as well as breast cancer but the importance of the sequence remains uncertain 
patients eligible for this study had measurable or evaluable advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma scc of the head and neck adenocarcinoma of the colon rectum or stomach or scc of other primary site table i 
eastern cooperative oncology group ecog performance status of 0 2 leukocyte count 3 0 x 10 l platelet count 100 x 10 l and adequate renal function scrum creatinine 90 umol l or creatinine clearance 1 0 ml sec were required 
patients received oral or iv bicarbonate to ensure a urine ph of at least 7 0 at the time of mtx administration and for 24 hours thereafter then oral folinic acid rescue far for eight doses of 15 mg each 6 hours commencing 24 hours after the mtx 
statistical analysis used bmdp statistical software to prepare and compare kaplan meier survival curves program bmdpil for the group as a whole and for subgroups by primary site treatment sequence performance status sex age group and response to therapy 
among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer disease stage expressed as tnm separately and as stage grouping using standard definitions of the american joint committee for cancer staging and end result reporting were also examined as possible prognostic factors for response and survival 
although the pretreatment stratification was by primary site only a reasonable balance of prognostic factors was achieved table 1 but there was a trend to less favorable performance status in the group receiving 5 fu before mtx 
four patients two on each treatment sequence died of treatment related complications sepsis in two patients diarrhea in one and aspiration pneumonia in one patient and a further patient developed prolonged neurologic toxicity with coma but recovered fully 
this was most extreme among previously untreated patients with head and neck cancer of this subgroup 65 responded to the sequence of mf while 39 of entered patients including 47 of those evaluable for response responded to the reverse fm sequence p 18 fisher s exact test 
because most responding patients with head and neck cancer received radiotherapy while still in response no meaningful response duration could be determined instead survival times are presented table 3 with a median survival of at least 13 months in all groups 
survival duration was not significantly different by treatment sequence in univariate analyses though the trend favored the sequence of 5 fu before mtx in which the median survival had not been reached at 23 months compared to a median survival of 13 3 months in the group receiving mtx before 5 fu 
cox model multivariate analysis showed that ecog performance status at study entry was the most significant prognostic factor for survival duration p 001 and that among the 70 patients with head and neck cancer when allowance was made for performance status a survival difference in favor of the reverse fm sequence emerged p 025 
biochemical and cell culture results from this laboratory suggested that the sequence dependent synergy observed in vitro between mtx and 5 fu was reduced in the presence of 1 3 umol l hypoxanthine a physiologic level found in human plasma 
because the question at issue was the sequence of drug administration rather than the study of a particular tumor type we chose to include patients with sccs of the head and neck colorectal or gastric adenocarcinoma and other sccs reasonably treated by either mtx or 5 fu 
in the small number of patients with colorectal cancer we observed a response rate of 33 40 of evaluable patients a figure somewhat higher than that usually seen after 5 fu as a single agent but the 95 confidence limits for this rate 19 64 emphasize that this could be a chance observation 
since this trial was commenced it has been suggested that the optimal time delay for sequence dependent synergy of mtx and 5 fu in human cancer cell lines may be longer than the one hour used in the present study
