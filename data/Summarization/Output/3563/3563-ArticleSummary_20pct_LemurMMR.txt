intestinal anastomosis has been successfully performed for more than 150 years using a variety of techniques materials and devices 
of these the method that has proven successful in most situations and in the hands of most surgeons has been the two layer anastomosis using interrupted silk sutures for an outer inverted seromuscular layer and a running absorbable suture for a transmural inner layer 
for six patients who required more than one anastomosis the same method was used for each anastomosis 
calculations for the outcome variables of leak abscess and time for construction of the anastomosis used the number of anastomoses in each group for the denominator 
in fact the only technique that has been unequivocally demonstrated to be unacceptable is the everted anastomosis 
since then the technique has remained essentially unchanged except for the evolution of suture material for the inner layer 
even more dramatic is the difference in cost when compared with a stapled anastomosis the disposable staple gun costs 115 26 and two refills cost an additional 123 54 for a total of 238 80 
opaque sealed envelopes indicating the technique to be used were placed in the operating room and were drawn sequentially when the need for intestinal anastomosis became apparent 
because less mesentery is cleared for the single layer anastomosis the cut edge of the bowel is more likely to have an adequate blood supply 
although it is certainly possible to create an ischemic continuous anastomosis by applying too much tension while following the suture hautefeuille has argued that this is easier to avoid with a continuous suture because there is no point in the anastomosis where the bowel is completely devoid of its blood supply 
anastomotic leaks intraabdominal abscesses length of time required for anastomosis length of stay and material costs are shown for both groups in table 2 
in contrast it is difficult for an experienced surgeon to create a two layer anastomosis in less than 20 to 25 minutes 
the ultimate test of the suitability of a technique for intestinal anastomosis is its ability to heal without leakage 
further most of the anastomoses in this study were performed by residents who were often unfamiliar with the technique or were performing their first intestinal anastomosis 
however our study design did not include the time required to prepare the bowel for anastomosis which is considerably less for the one layer technique 
although it did not quite reach statistical significance it may be related to an intrinsic difference between the two methods the single layer anastomosis always has a larger lumen 
all two layer anastomoses were constructed using interrupted 3 0 silk lembert sutures for the outer layer and a running 3 0 polyglycolic acid suture for the transmural inner layer 
in today s cost conscious environment the use of staples for anastomoses seems irresponsible if a hand sewn anastomosis can also be safely used in a similar time interval 
because at least three packets are required 15 sutures the cost for the outer layer alone is 28 33 compared with 4 51 for one packet of polypropylene suture 
each stitch was advanced approximately 5 mm to avoid ischemia of the anastomosis the surgeon had to ensure that only enough pressure was applied to the suture while following to approximate the ends of the bowel and render the anastomosis watertight
