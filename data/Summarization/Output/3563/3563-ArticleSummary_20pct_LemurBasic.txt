of these the method that has proven successful in most situations and in the hands of most surgeons has been the two layer anastomosis using interrupted silk sutures for an outer inverted seromuscular layer and a running absorbable suture for a transmural inner layer 
because of these potential advantages we hypothesized that the single layer technique could be introduced into our surgical teaching program with no increase in anastomotic failure and that it could be performed in less time than the two layer technique 
patients requiring anastomosis to the rectum or third or fourth portion of the duodenum were excluded because the single layer continuous method is awkward when both ends of the bowel cannot be fully mobilized 
the study was approved by the colorado multiple institutional review board which also granted a waiver of consent because both methods were in common use in our institution and had similar results 
all two layer anastomoses were constructed using interrupted 3 0 silk lembert sutures for the outer layer and a running 3 0 polyglycolic acid suture for the transmural inner layer 
each stitch was advanced approximately 5 mm to avoid ischemia of the anastomosis the surgeon had to ensure that only enough pressure was applied to the suture while following to approximate the ends of the bowel and render the anastomosis watertight 
anastomotic failure was defined as a fistula documented radiographically or by the finding of a nonabsorbable material charcoal draining from the wound after oral administration or a visible disruption of the suture line during reexploration 
all procedures were performed by postgraduate year 3 to 5 residents from the university of colorado health sciences center assisted by an attending surgeon or by the attending surgeons themselves 
of the three patients in whom fistulas developed one patient had abdominal carcinomatosis one had diffuse peritonitis from an iatrogenic injury of the cecum that occurred during a radical resection of a gynecologic malignancy and the third patient had been treated with an abbreviated laparotomy for trauma and was undergoing a planned reoperation 
the two layer interrupted anastomosis has its origins in the early 19th century through the experimental work of travers and of lembert who advocated careful approximation of the serosal surfaces of the bowel and devised a method of suturing to accomplish this 
the present study demonstrates that a single layer continuous anastomosis is similar in terms of safety to the two layer technique but that it can be constructed in a significantly shorter time and at a lower cost 
it is not surprising therefore that both feilding et al and tuson and everett found that leakage rates varied significantly between surgeons and tended to be lower with more experienced surgeons 
numerous studies in the literature comparing techniques e g one layer vs two layer hand sewn vs stapled and end to end vs end to side have failed to demonstrate a clear superiority of one over another 
to accomplish a two layer anastomosis at least 1 cm of the serosal surface must be circumferentially cleared of mesentery appendices epiploica and omentum before beginning the anastomosis 
the senior authors of this paper jmb eem have used the single layer technique exclusively for many years and can routinely perform an anastomosis in 8 to 10 minutes 
even more dramatic is the difference in cost when compared with a stapled anastomosis the disposable staple gun costs 115 26 and two refills cost an additional 123 54 for a total of 238 80 
in today s cost conscious environment the use of staples for anastomoses seems irresponsible if a hand sewn anastomosis can also be safely used in a similar time interval 
although it is certainly possible to create an ischemic continuous anastomosis by applying too much tension while following the suture hautefeuille has argued that this is easier to avoid with a continuous suture because there is no point in the anastomosis where the bowel is completely devoid of its blood supply 
further the surface of monofilament plastic suture is slick and may permit areas of relative excess extension to equilibrate with surrounding areas of less tension by minute movements of tissue with respect to the suture material 
bailey et al have speculated that the continuous single layer suture which resembles a circular coiled spring may be able to expand and contract depending on intraluminal forces
