PURPOSE, As previously shown, antibody treatment increased survival of patients with resected colorectal cancer of stage Dukes' C.

Since the 5- year analysis was criticized because of the wide range (2.7 to 7.5 years) of follow-up time, we performed a 7-year analysis with only four of 189 patients monitored for less than 5 years.

After 7 years of follow-up evaluation, treatment had reduced overall mortality by 32% (Cox's proportional hazard, P < .01, log-rank, P=.01) and decreased the recurrence rate by 23% (Cox's proportional hazard, P < .04, log-rank, P=.07).
