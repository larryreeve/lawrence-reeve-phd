since the 5 year analysis was criticized because of the wide range 2 7 to 7 5 years of follow up time we performed a 7 year analysis with only four of 189 patients monitored for less than 5 years 
patients and methods a total of 189 patients with resected dukes c colorectal cancer were randomly allocated to infusions of a total of 900 mg 17 1a antibody 500 mg postoperatively followed by 4 monthly doses of 100 mg n 99 or to observation only n 90 
after 7 years of follow up evaluation treatment had reduced overall mortality by 32 cox s proportional hazard p 01 log rank p 01 and decreased the recurrence rate by 23 cox s proportional hazard p 04 log rank p 07 
the intentionto treat analysis gave a significant effect for overall survival cox s proportional hazard p 01 log rank p 02 and disease free survival cox s proportional hazard p 02 log rank p 1 1 
wondering what the characteristic features of these trials were one notes that two of these trials one in lymphoma and one in breast carcinoma 2 had been performed with engineered antibodies ie either human murine chimeric or human complementanly defining regious cdr grafted mmunoglobulins respectively while the third stands out because of the target and end point used 
in contrast to other trials aimed at patients with larger metastatic tumor masses and using regression or shrinkage as the end point this one on colorectal cancer of stage dukes c required microscopically complete resection of the primary tumor for patients to be admitted 3 as the primary end point overall survival was determined at 5 years 
here we report on the 7 year follow up study of this prospective randomized two arm trial in minimal residual disease that used the murine 17 1a antibody 4 which recognizes a 34 kd glycoprotein of the cell membrane of epithelial cells 5 the 5 year analysis had shown that a short albeit intensive postoperative course of antibody treatment 900 mg total dose significantly reduced the appearance of distant metastases but did not affect the rate of local relapses 
as recently shown for breast carcinoma without regional radiation therapy occult local metastases can give rise to distant metastases after many years and thus affect long term survival 6 7 therefore with no effect of antibody therapy on the local relapse at 5 years it was of interest to know how the overall survival evolved at the 7 year follow up evaluation 
the multicenter study consisted of six academic centers in former west germany a total of 189 patients were randomized with the first patient entered in may 1985 and the last in apnl 1990 the study was closed in december 1992 and we present here the final status with median follow up data of 7 years eligible patients were required to have histologically confirmed adenocarcmoma of colon or the rectum with spread to regional lymph nodes dukes c or international unimon agamst cancer uicc stage iii in addition hlstopathologic confirmation of curative resection r0 was secured radical tumor resection was performed by a standardized technique agreed upon by all participating centers when located within 15 cm of the anal verge a tumor was classified as rectal carcinoma patients were less than 70 years old and had a karnofsky index greater than 50 eleven of 99 patients randomized to treatment refused their treatment assignment but were otherwise considered eligible for the study 
all patients were stratified according to zelen 8 by the following factors participating center sex location of tumor stage dukes cl or c2 equivalent to pn1 or pn2 3 number of affected lymph nodes and carcinoembryonic antigen cea level before surgery table 1 in the treated arm more patients had pt2 and pt3 tumors and fewer had pt4 tumors however treated patients appeared to have had higher numbers of involved lymph nodes pn2 and tumors of less differentiated histology grade 3 
however a fishers exact test companng the distnbutlon of patients according to all prognostic variables showed no significant differences randomlzation before consent was performed and evaluated according to zelen 9 on approval by legal experts in 1985 this procedure was accepted by the ethical review board statistical analyses were performed according to sas statistical analysis system cary nc to test for potential selection bias in the study a retrospective analysis was performed at medizimnische hochschule hannover on 67 dukes c colorectal cancer patients selected from 107 patients seen between 1980 and 1985 they fulfilled the entry criteria for the 17 1a clinical trial and were monitored for at least 5 years each the survival analysis was performed by the instutut fur medlzinische informatlk und blomathematlk umversltat essen the overall survival according to kaplan meier curve is nearly identical to the control group of the 17 1a trial log rank p 97 thus this historical control does not show any selection bias 
patients in both groups were monitored in exactly the same way with 14 prospectively defined follow up visits first on a quarterly and later on a half year basis follow up evaluation continued beyond 5 years at yearly time points but without formal protocol requirements 
for the end point analysis standardized and objectively verifiable dates were used for all patients e time point of surgery up to death of all cause or date of last contact alive for overall survival analysis in a separate analysis cancer related mortality was assessed e death without recurrence was not counted as an event 
the 17 1a antibody a munne monoclonal mmunoglobulin igg2a antibody orginally described by herlyn has a distinct antitumor effect on human xenografted tumors in a nude mouse model clnical grade antibody was purchased from the wistar institute philadelphia pa with support by the german cancer aid bonn germany 
the death rate of the observed group was 63 48 of 76 95 ci range 48 to 78 of patients and that of the treated group was 43 39 of 90 95 ci range 31 to 58 
the kaplanmeier survival curves fig 1a showed a significant benefit for patients who received antibody over those who did not receive treatment p 01 with cox s proportional hazard model corrected for influence of prognostic variables and p 01 with log rank test for the univariate analysis 
also the intention to treat analysis fig b on all 185 patients showed a significant overall benefit for the treated group p 01 with cox s multivariate analysis and p 02 with log rank test for the univanate analysis 
when cancer related mortality was assessed ie death without recurrence was not counted as event the benefit of treatment remained significant at p 01 by cox s multivariate analysis and p 01 by log rank test for the univariate analysis 
according to the disease free interval analysis tumor recurred in 96 of 166 eligible patients after 7 years of follow up evaluation thus three more recurrences were recorded m the treatment group and one more in the observation arm 
however when death without recurrence was considered an event recurrence free survival again a significant treatment advantage with 17 1a over control was obtained p 03 with cox multivariate and p 05 with log rank test for the umvariate analysis 
when the analyses of recurrence free interval and recurrence free survival were performed including all randomized patients ie according to intention to treat 17 1a treatment again led to significant advantage over the untreated group cox multivanate p 02 log rank p 01 respectively 
when the two groups were compared with regard to the site of first recurrence the 7 year data similar to the 5 year analysis show that significantly fewer distant recurrences occur in patients treated with the antibody than in the control arm fig 3 
also the less significant umvariate analyses may well be explained by the large treatment effect which we expected at the onset of the trial in 1985 when we hoped for an absolute reduction of events from 50 to 30 ie a 40 relative reduction 
since these forms of therapy were administered only to the control group a bias may have been introduced that influenced the outcome against the antibody treatment which explains the apparent difference seen m the local recurrence rate table 2 
for example the national surgical adjuvant breast and bowel project nsabp conducted a study from 1977 to 1983 to compare a combination regimen that consisted of semustmine folic acid and fluorouracil with bacillus calmette guerin 
however this argument rests on the assumption that the antibody exerts its antitumor effect by mobilization of direct effector mechanisms that are active only as long as the antibody is bound to the target 
this strategy originally pro1 7 posed by sears et al was only partially successful as only about 20 of the recipients did not respond to mouse immunoglobulin while the others exhibited a distinct albeit slow rise of hama titers 
however patients with and without manifest metastatic relapses did not differ in antiidiotype titers 18 to detect ab3 antibodies we applied a sensitive enzyme linked mmunoadsorbent assay elisa which allowed us to determine human 17 1a autoantibody 
it is safe to assume that antigenic heterogeneity a likely consequence of the marked genomic instability of human epithelial tumors will be a major obstacle for single antibody treatments as well as for any other form of monotherapy 
in other studies that also targeted a monoclonal antibody to an organ specific rather than a tumor specific antigen the tumor specific biologic action induced by the applied antibody had been ascribed to the faster elimination of the bound antibody from normal than from malignant cells
