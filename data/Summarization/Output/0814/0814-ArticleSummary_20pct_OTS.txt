  The aim of this trial is to assess the effectiveness and toxicity of adjuvant post-operative RT vs combined RT and CT (5-FU plus levamisole) in patients with TNM stage II-III resectable rectal cancer (pT3-4, pN0, M0; Eligible patients are enrolled within 40 days after surgery in a multicentre randomized clinical trial with two arms: Arm I = post-operative RT;  Within 42 days from surgery, patients randomized in Arm I receive RT (50 Gy) in daily fractions of 2 Gy, 5 days/wk for 5 wk, to tumour bed and loco-regional lymph-nodes (internal iliac and presacral nodes) with four portals (LL and AP). Patients randomized in Arm II begin with the first cycle of 5-FU (450 mg/sqm/d iv bolus on days 1-5) plus ievamisole (150 mg/d orally on days 1-3). hence, 175 patients will be enrolled in each arm to obtain 80% power of the study related to 15% increase of 5-year survival in RT+CT treated patients.
