survival. of adjuvant post-operative RT vs combined RT and CT
(5-FU plus levamisole) in patients with TNM stage II-III
Dosage schedule.

The primary end-point of the study is overall survival and the expected 5-year survival in RT-treated patients is 50%; hence, 175 patients will be enrolled in each arm to obtain 80% power of the study related to 15% increase of 5-year survival in RT+CT treated patients. As regards toxicity, radiodermatitis (8.3%, Grade III) and diarrhoea (8.3%, Grade III) were observed in Arm I while radiodermatitis (13.6%, Grade III), diarrhoea (27.3%, Grade III; 9.1%, Grade IV), and leukopaenia (8.3%, Grade III) occurred in Arm II.
