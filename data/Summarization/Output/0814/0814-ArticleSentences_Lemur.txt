Introduction. *eos 

Loco-regional and distant relapses contribute to impair theoutcome of rectal cancer patients) As to the former, eitherpre- or post-operative radiation therapy (RT) significantlyreduce loco-regional recurrence, post-operative chemotherapy(CT), alone or in different combinations with RT,is effective in improving both disease-free survival andsurvival.  *eos However, many drawbacks still exist regarding themethod of RT delivery as well as the toxicity of combinationadjuvant chemotherapy. *eos 

Purpose. *eos 

The aim of this trial is to assess the effectiveness and toxicityof adjuvant post-operative RT vs combined RT and CT(5-FU plus levamisole) in patients with TNM stage II-IIIresectable rectal cancer (pT3-4, pN0, M0, pTl-4, pNl-3,M0).  *eos The primary endpoint is overall survival, secondaryendpoints are disease-free survival, rate of loco-regionalrecurrence, and treatment-related toxicity/morbidity. *eos 

Materials and methods. *eos 

From May 1992 to December 1994, 149 patients (80 males, 69 females, age range 40-75, median 64.7 years of age) with 0-2 (ECOG) performance status (PS) were enrolled by the P.A.R.  *eos Cooperative Study Group.  *eos Protocol entry criteria are, en-bloc resection of all known tumour, a surgical specimen which must be adequate for TNM staging, pT3-4, pN0, M0 and pT 1-4, pNl-3, M0 primary rectal adenocarcinoma, microscopically negative resection margins.  *eos Patients excluded included those with recurrent cancer, or with second malignancy (except non-melanomatous skin cancer and in-situ cervical cancer), active infection, pregnant or nursing women.  *eos No prior or concurrent chemo-, immuno-, radio-, and endocrine therapy are allowed.  *eos 

As regards haematobiochemical tests, patients should have WBC count at least 4000/cmm, PLT at least 100,000/cmm, bilirubin < 1.5 x N, AP, ALT, AST < 2.5 x N, creatinine < 1.25 x N.  *eos Eligible patients are enrolled within 40 days after surgery in a multicentre randomized clinical trial with two arms, Arm I = post-operative RT, Arm II = post-operative RT and CT (5-FU plus levamisole), with stratification by participating institutions.  *eos 

Dosage schedule. *eos 

Within 42 days from surgery, patients randomized in Arm I receive RT (50 Gy) in daily fractions of 2 Gy, 5 days/wk for 5 wk, to tumour bed and loco-regional lymph-nodes (internal iliac and presacral nodes) with four portals (LL and AP).  *eos External iliac nodes are included in the radiation field if the tumour invaded bladder, prostate, cervix or vagina.  *eos Patients randomized in Arm II begin with the first cycle of 5-FU (450 mg/sqm/d iv bolus on days 1-5) plus ievamisole (150 mg/d orally on days 1-3).  *eos Post-operative RT is delivered during the next week at the same dosage and schedule as in Arm I.  *eos The other five cycles of CT (5-FU every 28 days, and levamisole every 15 days for the whole length of 5-FU administration) continue at the end of RT, provided that all clinical and haemato-biochemical parameters are within the normal range.  *eos 

Statistical and ethical considerations. *eos 

The primary end-point of the study is overall survival and the expected 5-year survival in RT-treated patients is 50%, hence, 175 patients will be enrolled in each arm to obtain 80% power of the study related to 15% increase of 5-year survival in RT+CT treated patients.  *eos According to the 'intention to treat' principle, all patients randomized will be included in the final analysis.  *eos Each patient will be informed as regards the modalities of treatment and the aim of the study, he/she will give oral or written consensus.  *eos 

Preliminary results. *eos 

No significant differences as regards sex, age, performance states, type of operation (sphincter-saving resection or abdominoperineal excision of the rectum), pT, pN stages of disease, number of sampled lymph-nodes, and grading were observed in 76 and 73 patients randomized in Arms I and II, respectively.  *eos The median randomization time occurred on the 19th post-operative day (range, 6-24 days), on average, patients began RT 43 days from surgery (range, 27-98 days).  *eos Up to now, two and seven relapses, respectively, have been observed in Arms I and II, two and three patients, respectively have died in Arms I and II.  *eos As regards toxicity, radiodermatitis (8.3%, Grade III) and diarrhoea (8.3%, Grade III) were observed in Arm I while radiodermatitis (13.6%, Grade III), diarrhoea (27.3%, Grade III, 9.1%, Grade IV), and leukopaenia (8.3%, Grade III) occurred in Arm II.  *eos Despite the short duration of the trial, these preliminary findings confirm the validity of the rationale with lower morbidity for radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy.  *eos
