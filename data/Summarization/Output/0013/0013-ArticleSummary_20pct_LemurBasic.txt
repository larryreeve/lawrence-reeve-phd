although many patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix are cured with local measures a substantial minority recur or present with metastases and are potential candidates for systemic therapy 
cisplatin is said to be the most active anticancer drug in cervical cancer although 100 mg m did not significantly improve the complete response cr rate compared prospectively with 50 mg m 12 7 v 10 respectively and there was no appreciable difference in response duration progression free interval pfi or survival thus there is no convincing reason to use a cisplatindose higher than 50 mg m 
a phase ii study of the gynecologic oncology group gog demonstrated activity formitolactol as a single agent in cervical cancer using 180mg m d for 10 days by mouth in repeated 4 week cycles there were 55 assessable patients with one cr and 15 partial responses prs 29 response rate 
although an intermediate dose level 50 mg m cisplatin and 225mg m mitolactol daily for 5 days was considered it wasnot pursued since six of 10 patients at the first dose level in the pilot study required dose reductions and or delays with re treatment 
the result was impressive but the importance of bleomycin was unclear and its toxicity sometimes troublesome so we proposed to compare cisplatin alone versus a regimen of cisplatinplus mitolactol c m and a regimen of cisplatin plusifosfamide and mesna cifx 
however shortly after activation the study was amended so that the serum creatinine concentration was to be within the institution s normal limits and the serum albumin level was to be 3 g dl 
ineligible patients included those with cervical neoplasms other than squamous cell carcinoma or with nonmeasurable cervical cancer wbc count less than 4 000 ul and or platelet count less than 100 000 ul abnormal liver function bilirubin ast or alkaline phosphatase level two times normal not related to the cancer bilateral hydronephrosis gog ps 3 or 4 past or concomitant malignancy other than skin excluding melanoma prior therapy with cytotoxic drugs except when used as a radiation sensitizer radiationtherapy within 3 weeks of entry lesions measurable only by ultrasound or pregnancy or lactation 
patients were prospectively stratified according to whether they had received prior radiation sensitizer treatment hydroxyurea cisplatin or fluorouracil and by ps and were then centrally randomized with equal probability to receive 1 cisplatin 50 mg m with appropriate hydration every 3 weeks for a maximum of six courses or 2 cisplatin 50 mg m on day 1 plus mitolactol 180 mg m orally for 5 days on days 2 through 6 every 3 weeks or 3 cisplatin 50mg m plus ifosfamide 5 0 g m over 24 hours plus mesna 6 g m given concurrently with ifosfamide and for 12 hours after every 3 weeks again for a maximum of six courses 
the design for this study was based on the assumption that a 15 increase in the response rate due to the addition of either mitolactolor ifosfamide to cisplatin would be regarded as clinically meaningful 
the null hypothesis was rejected if the probability of the observed result or a more extreme result under the null hypothesis was less than 0 025 one tail test a linear logistic model was used to adjust for age ps and whether cisplatin had been used as a radiosensitizer 
between june 1990 and january 1994 454 women entered the study of whom 16 were ineligible wrong stage n 2 wrong cell type n 9 wrong primary tumor n 2 prior chemotherapy n 2 second primary tumor n 1 which left 438 eligible patients including 10 who received no drug all were included in the intent to treat analysis 
subsequent patients were required to have a pretreatment serum albumin level 3 0 g dl and aserum creatinine concentration within the institution snormal limits and patients with bilateral hydronephrosiswere ineligible 
pfs fig 1 adjusted for age ps and prior cisplatinas a radiosensitizer was statistically significantly longer for cifx median 4 6 v 3 2 months compared with cisplatin alone p 003 however there was no difference between c m and cisplatin alone 
initial ps not shown was also associated with survival ps 0 was favorable p 001 the median durations of survival for ps 0 1 and 2 were 10 0 7 4 and 6 8 months respectively 
the results of this trial in cervix cancer reflect a common set of findings in combination chemotherapy of advanced solid tumors namely a higher response rate but not a high cr rate with a combination compared with single agent therapy at the cost of more toxicity and no survival benefit 
since the role of bleomycin in cervix cancer is unclear but implies restricting therapy to patients with good pulmonary function we elected not to include bleomycinin the present study 
early experience in randomized phase ii trials suggested that bleomycin and vincristine contributed importantly to combination regimens but other randomized phase ii trials have not supported a major role for these agents 
the pilot study on which the c m arm of the present trial was based identified 180 mg m for 5 days as the maximum tolerated dose in combination with cisplatin 
although we are not aware of such complications in the present trial the possible risk of secondary malignancies plus the failure to show an improvement in outcome for c m would suggest a limited future for mitolactol in the treatment of cervix cancer 
it appears that studies are limited to a comparison of doxorubicin with or without vincristine and doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide n 174 with no difference in response rate pfi or survival a comparison of cisplatin dose schedules already referred to a study of cisplatin infusion time n 331 and a comparison of carboplatin versus iproplatin n 361 with no difference in response rate pfi or survival 
a survival benefit was reported in a small trial 25 patients in favor of cisplatin plus methotrexate over hydroxyurea but prerandomization was used ps was not accounted for and there may have been other imbalances in the treatment arms that could account for the difference in outcome 
one of the earlier gog trials showed an improved overall response rate 31 4 v 20 7 p 015 with double dose cisplatin 100 mg m2 but no improvement in cr rate pfi or survival
