In the supportive-care alone group, patients were given best supportive care and were seen every 3 weeks. After discontinuation of treatment in the irinotecan group, patients were regularly assessed as in the supportive care group (tumour status, symptoms, or side-effects, every 3 weeks) until death or for at least a year. After discontinuation of treatment in the irinotecan group, patients continued to fill in QLQ-C30 questionnaires every 6 weeks as in the supportive-care group. 

189 patients were randomly allocated irinotecan and supportive care and 90 patients were allocated supportive care alone (figure 1). These characteristics were similar for both groups except for performance status (more patients having poor performance status in the supportive-care group were assessed by carcinoembryonic antigen only, with mean antigen ratios versus reference values of 2.24 and 2.83, respectively. 


Six patients in the irinotecan group did not receive irinotecan. 40 (21%) patients in the irinotecan group received subsequent anticancer chemotherapies (31 a fluorouracil regimen, nine a drug other than irinotecan). 17 (19%) patients in the supportive-care group received chemotherapy within 1 month of randomisation compared with two (1%) in the irinotecan group. There were 123 (65%) events in the irinotecan group, median duration of which was 9.2 (range 0-18.9) months. The survival probability for this group at 6 months was 72.2%, at 9 months 52.6%, and at 12 months 36.2%. In this group the survival probability at 6 months was 54.1%, at 9 months 29.1%, and at 12 months 13.8%. Patients in the irinotecan group lived significantly longer than those in the supportive-care group (p=0.0001). 1-year survival was 36.2% and 13.8% in the irinotecan and supportive-care groups, respectively. Median survival was 9.2 and 6.5 months, respectively. The survival probability for this group at 6 months was 76.3%, at 9 months 57.2%, and at 12 months 40.1%. In this group the survival probability at 6 months was 62.5%, at 9 months 33.2%, and at 12 months 16.2%. The survival probability for this group at 6 months was 46.2%, at 9 months 26.9%, and at 12 months 15.4%. In this group the survival probability at 6 months was 26.5%, at 9 months 15.9%, and at 12 months 7.9%. When the treatment group was included in the model,the survival benefit for the irinotecan group remained significant (p=0.001). Pain-free survival in patients without pain at baseline (figure 4) was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the supportive-care group (p=0.003), despite a higher proportion of patients on opioids in the supportive-care group. The survival probability for this group at 6 months was 56.8%, at 9 months 36.6%, and at 12 months 18.8%. In this group the survival probability at 6 months was 31.5%, at 9 months 14.7%, and at 12 months 4.9%. Patients on supportive-care alone experienced a high incidence of severe adverse events, especially pain and asthenia, although significantly more patients in the irinotecan group experienced severe events, especially neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Other efficacy endpoints, such as survival without weight loss, survival without performance status deterioration, pain-free survival, and quality-of-life, were all significantly in favour of irinotecan. 


The survival advantage for the irinotecan group remained highly significant after adjustment of performance status, a well-recognised prognostic factor.
