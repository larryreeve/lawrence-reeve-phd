Introduction. *eos 

Colorectal cancer is one of the most common adult  malignant tumours, affecting one person in twenty in the  USA and in most developed countries.  *eos Although  40-50% patients may be cured with surgery, many will  develop metastatic disease.  *eos For these patients, treatment  with fluorouracil, usually modulated by folinic acid, is  the only option and the median survival is  10-12 months.  *eos When the tumour progresses after first-line treatment with fluorouracil, there is no standard  treatment.  *eos Survival is short and associated with weight  loss, onset or worsening of tumour-related symptoms, and poor quality of life.  *eos Because cytotoxic agents have low response rates and can be associated with severe side-effects, many patients receive supportive care.  *eos In first-line chemotherapy, fluorouracil with folinic-acid is  better than supportive care (or delayed chemotherapy) for survival and quality of life, but the value of second-line chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer has  not yet been proven.  *eos 

Irinotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor that blocks the DNA replication step of the enzyme,leading to multiple single-strand DNA breaks, which eventually blocks cell division.  *eos In phase II studies, irinotecan has  objective antitumour activity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, even in those with documented  fluorouracil-resistant tumours, with response rates of  11.23%.  *eos An additional 40% of patients experienced tumour stabilisation for a median of 5 months.   *eos Common side-effects included delayed diarrhoea, neutropenia,early cholinergic syndrome, nausea and  vomiting, alopecia,and asthenia.  *eos The dose-limiting toxic  effects were severe diarrhoea and neutropenia. *eos 

The trial we report was started in 1995 to compare irinotecan with supportive care alone for survival, quality  of life, and other clinical variables.  *eos The participants were  patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in whom fluorouracil chemotherapy had failed.  *eos 

Methods.  *eos 

Endpoints. *eos 

Overall survival was the primary endpoint.  *eos The secondary objectives were the impact of treatment on performance status, bodyweight,tumour-related symptoms, and quality of life.  *eos 

Patients' selection. *eos 

To be eligible for randomisation, patients had to meet the following criteria, histologically proven metastatic colorectal cancer, progressive metastatic disease documented on the basis of either a 25% increase in the size of target lesions or an increase in carcinoembryonic antigen by 1.25 times an initial reference value and a baseline value of more than 10 ug/L,  which allowed inclusion of patients with non-measurable  disease (peritoneal carcinomatosis and pelvic recurrences),  progression documented by two measurements not separated by  more than 6 months and tumour progression while on  fluorouracil or within 6 months of the last fluorouracil infusion, having had one adjuvant and/or no more than two palliative  fluorouracil-based regimens, age 18-75 years, WHO performance status 0.2, neutrophils 2 10/L or more, platelets  100x10/L or more, total bilirubin 1.25 the institutional upper normal limit (IUNL), or less, liver transaminases 3xIUNL (in  case of liver metastases, bilirubin <=1.5 IUNL and  transaminases <=5 IUNL), or more, serum creatinine  135 umol/L or less, wash-out of 4 weeks for radiotherapy or  chemotherapy, and written informed consent.  *eos 

Patients with the following criteria were not eligible, previous treatment with topoisomerase I inhibitors, bulky disease (involving more than 50% of the liver volume or 25% of the lung volume, or abdominal mass >=10 cm), metastases in the  central nervous system, or unresolved bowel obstruction or diarrhoea.  *eos 

Randomisation and study treatments. *eos 

Registration forms were sent to Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Research and Development (Antony, France) where eligibility criteria  were electronically checked.  *eos If all criteria were fulfilled, the  randomisation was done electronically in the ratio of irinotecan to supportive care 2,1, with stratification by centre.  *eos 

In the irinotecan group, patients were given best supportive care and irinotecan 350 mg/m, diluted in 250 mL normal saline or dextrose, over a 90 min intravenous infusion every 3 weeks  (or 300 mg/m if aged >=70 years or WHO performance status 2, according to previously recognised risk factors for developing  toxicity).  *eos Guidelines were provided for the management of side-effects (panel).  *eos Treatment was to be started no longer than  8 days after randomisation.  *eos In the supportive-care alone group, patients were given best supportive care and were seen every 3 weeks.  *eos Supportive care was defined as the best care available as judged by the attending physician, according to institutional standards for each centre.  *eos Supportive care included antibiotics,  analgesics, transfusions, corticosteroids, or any other  symptomatic therapy (except iriontecan or other topoisomerase  I inhibitor), and/or assistance of a psychotherapist.  *eos Localised  radiation therapy to alleviate symptoms such as pain was  allowed provided that the total dose delivered was in the  palliative range according to institutional standards.  *eos 

Analysis of best supportive care. *eos 

Supportive care and concomitant medications were reported at each visit (every 3 weeks in both groups).  *eos They were classified  with the WHO dictionary, further subclassification was done  with the WHO code for anatomical therapeutic class (ATC).   *eos With these classifications, analgesics were divided into opioids  or non-opioids and analysed in 3-week blocks.  *eos 

Follow-up. *eos 

Patients visited the investigator for assessment and treatment every 3 weeks.  *eos All adverse events were reported according to  the National Cancer Institute's common toxicity criteria.   *eos After discontinuation of treatment in the irinotecan group, patients were regularly assessed as in the supportive care group  (tumour status, symptoms, or side-effects, every 3 weeks) until  death or for at least a year.  *eos Beyond 1 year, only date of death  was traced.  *eos 

Quality of life. *eos 

Quality of life was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire (including five function scales, one global health-status scale, and nine symptom scales), which was filled in at  baseline, at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and then every 6 weeks.  *eos After  discontinuation of treatment in the irinotecan group, patients continued to fill in QLQ-C30 questionnaires every 6 weeks as in  the supportive-care group.  *eos 

Statistical analysis. *eos 

Survival curves were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method on the randomised population and compared by a two-tailed logrank test.  *eos With p=0.05 and power of 0.80, 264 patients were  required (176 in the irinotecan group and 88 in the supportive-care group) to show a significant difference in 1-year survival from 20% (supportive care) to 35% (irinotecan).  *eos 

The randomisation was stratified by centre.  *eos A retrospective stratification was planned to take into account the baseline prognostic factors (sex, age, performance status, weight loss, presence of liver metastases, site of primary tumour, number of  metastatic sites, response to and duration of fluorouracil treatment as well as its intent [adjuvant or palliative],  haemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets, lactate  dehydrogenase, transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, protein, and carcinoembryonic antigen).  *eos 

The analysis was by intention to treat and patients were analysed according to the arm to which they were assigned.  *eos The association of prognostic factors with survival was estimated  with Cox's proportional hazards model for censored survival  data.  *eos Model selection for identifying the variables having an effect on survival was based on a forward stepwise procedure. p values to enter and to remove were 0.05 and 0.06, respectively.   *eos After the prognostic model had been determined, the effect of treatment after adjusting for other prognostic factors was  estimated by including it in the model.  *eos Survival without weight  loss of more than 5% survival without performance-status  deterioration, and pain-free survival were estimated by the   Kaplan-Meier method and compared with a two-tailed logrank  test.  *eos Quality-of-life variables were compared with multivariate and univariate analyses of variance on values at baseline, during  study, on patients' worst score over the trial period, and changes  from baseline.  *eos Kaplan-Meier estimates and logrank tests were done on time to definitive quality-of-life deterioration, with eight different thresholds for deterioration.  *eos 

Results. *eos 

Patients' data. *eos 

189 patients were randomly allocated irinotecan and supportive care and 90 patients were allocated  supportive care alone (figure 1).  *eos The patients' characteristics are shown in table 1.  *eos These characteristics were similar for both groups except for performance status (more patients having poor performance status in the supportive-care group were assessed by carcinoembryonic antigen only, with mean antigen ratios versus reference values of 2.24 and 2.83, respectively.  *eos 

Six patients in the irinotecan group did not receive  irinotecan.  *eos Irinotecan was given for a median of 4.1  (0.7-12.6) months and 172 (91%) patients received their  first infusion within 8 days of randomisation. 40 (21%)  patients in the irinotecan group received subsequent  anticancer chemotherapies (31 a fluorouracil regimen,  nine a drug other than irinotecan).  *eos In the supportive- care group 28 (31%) of patients received chemotherapy (21 a fluorouracil regimen, nine other drugs, and one irinotecan). 17 (19%) patients in the supportive-care  group received chemotherapy within 1 month  of randomisation compared with two (1%) in the  irinotecan group.  *eos Concomitant medications at baseline were similar in both groups and consisted mainly of  analgesics.  *eos 

Overall survival. *eos 

Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival are presented in figure 2.  *eos There were 123 (65%) events in the irinotecan  group, median duration of which was 9.2 (range 0-18.9)  months.  *eos The survival probability for this group at  6 months was 72.2%, at 9 months 52.6%, and at  12 months 36.2%.  *eos In the supportive-care group there were 71 (79%) events, the median duration of which was  6.5 (range 0.7-19.3) months.  *eos In this group the survival probability at 6 months was 54.1%, at 9 months 29.1%, and at 12 months 13.8%.  *eos Median follow-up was 12.9 months.  *eos Patients in the irinotecan group lived significantly longer than those in the supportive-care  group (p=0.0001).  *eos This benefit appeared after 2 months and became more apparent throughout the study period.  1-year survival was 36.2% and 13.8% in the irinotecan and supportive-care groups, respectively.  *eos Median  survival was 9.2 and 6.5 months, respectively.  *eos A univariate Cox's model showed that patients with  performance status 0 or 1 shared the same prognosis, which was notably better than that for patients with performance status 2.  *eos Figure 3 shows that the benefit of treatment occurred in all performance-status groups.   *eos With a performance status of less than two there were 98 (60%) events in the irinotecan group, median duration  of which was 10.5 (range 0.18-9) months.  *eos The survival  probability for this group at 6 months was 76.3%, at  9 months 57.2%, and at 12 months 40.1%.  *eos In the  supportive-care-alone group there were 53 (77%) events,  median duration 7.4 (0.7-19.3) months.  *eos In this group  the survival probability at 6 months was 62.5%, at  9 months 33.2%, and at 12 months 16.2%.  *eos With a performance status of two there were 24 (92%) events in  the irinotecan group, median duration of which was 5.1  (range 0.3-18.5) months.  *eos The survival probability for  this group at 6 months was 46.2%, at 9 months 26.9%, and at 12 months 15.4%.  *eos In the supportive-care group there were 18 (86%) events, the median duration of  which was 3.5 (range 1.1-11.0) months.  *eos In this group  the survival probability at 6 months was 26.5%, at 9 months 15.9%, and at 12 months 7.9%.  *eos Multivariate  Cox's regression confirmed the importance of other known prognostic factors (table 2).  *eos When the  treatment group was included in the model,the survival benefit for the irinotecan group remained significant (p=0.001).  *eos 

Secondary endpoints. *eos 

Survival without weight loss of more than 5% (p=0.018) and survival without performance-status deterioration (p=0.0001) were significantly longer in the irinotecan group.  *eos More patients with a performance-status of worse than 0 at baseline improved their performance status,  35% versus 11% (p=0.002).  *eos Pain-free survival in patients without pain at baseline (figure 4) was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the supportive-care group (p=0.003), despite a higher proportion of patients on opioids in the supportive-care group.  *eos There  were 61 (73%) events in the irinotecan group, median  duration of which was 6.9 (range 0.3-17.2) months.  *eos The  survival probability for this group at 6 months was 56.8%, at 9 months 36.6%, and at 12 months 18.8%.  *eos In  the supportive-care group there were 26 (79%) events,  median duration 2.0 (0.13.0) months.  *eos In this group the survival probability at 6 months was 31.5%, at 9 months  14.7%, and at 12 months 4.9%.  *eos Within 23 weeks of randomisation, the rate of patients with opioid  consumption by 3-week blocks ranged from 25% to 34% in the irinotecan group and from 40% to 56% in the  supportive-care group. *eos 

In the quality-of-life analysis, compliance of patients was about 80% in both groups at the beginning of study  and decreased during the study to about 50%.   *eos Compliance decreased more rapidly in the supportive-care group, probably due to earlier deterioration in the  patients.  *eos On difference from baseline multivariate  analysis of variance was significant (p=0.0001). *eos 

The univariate analyses of variance were significantly in favour of the irinotecan group for the cognitive functioning score (p.0.001), the global quality-of-life  score (p<0.001), the pain score (p=0.008), dyspnoea  (p=0.04), appetite loss (p<0.002), and financial-impact scores (p<0.001).  *eos The diarrhoea score was significantly better in the supportive-care group (p=0.02).  *eos Analyses on worst patient score during the study are shown in  table 3, all results were significantly in favour of irinotecan except for emotional, nausea, sleep  disturbance, and financial scores.  *eos Diarrhoea score was  significantly lower in the supportive-care group.  *eos Time to definitive quality-of-life deterioration was significantly longer in the irinotecan group, whichever the chosen threshold for deterioration (all p values <0.002).  *eos 

Safety. *eos 

Table 4 shows the incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events (drug related or not) by patient.  *eos Patients on supportive-care alone experienced a high incidence of severe adverse events, especially pain and asthenia, although significantly more patients in the irinotecan group experienced severe events, especially neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea.  *eos Two (1.1%) of 183 patients treated with irinotecan died of drug-related causes although,in one, the association with adverse events (diarrhoea and/or febrile neutropenia) has not been clearly established.  *eos Admission for adverse events  occurred in 136 (72%) of patients in the irinotecan group and 57 (63%) of patients in the supportive-carealone group for a cumulative median of 15 (range 1.168) days and 11 (2.87) days, respectively.  *eos 

Discussion. *eos 

This study showed that treatment with irinotecan and supportive care alone, compared with supportive care, prolonged the life of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.  *eos This benefit was clinically meaningful because  the probability of surviving 1 year was 2.6 times greater in patients given irinotecan compared with that of patients given supportive care alone.  *eos Other efficacy endpoints, such as survival without weight loss, survival  without performance status deterioration, pain-free survival, and quality-of-life, were all significantly in  favour of irinotecan.  *eos 

The survival advantage for the irinotecan group remained highly significant after adjustment of performance status, a well-recognised prognostic  factor.  *eos More generally, the multivariate regression showed that the difference in survival between the two groups remained significant even after adjusting for the  effect of well-known prognostic factors.  *eos The survival data were also consistent with those observed in the phase II studies of irinotecan.   *eos 

The study also showed an advantage for irinotecan for quality of life.  *eos The results were consistent with other clinical variables (performance status deterioration, weight loss,and pain control).  *eos The analysis of the EORTC QLQ-C30 symptoms scale was consistent with the safety data.  *eos This suggests that the EORTC QLQC30 questionnaire is sensitive, contrary to a previous  report. *eos 

The safety profile of irinotecan was acceptable.  *eos The incidence of treatment-related grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea  with irinotecan (21%) was lower than that reported in previous studies (39%).  *eos This result, observed in a  multicentre trial, is probably accounted for by the more rigorous implementation of guidelines for the management of diarrhoea than in earlier studies.  *eos Grade 3.4 neutropenia was reported in 22% and grade 3.4 vomiting in 14% of patients.  *eos Asthenia, pain, and  neurological symptoms were more frequent in the supportive-care group.  *eos 

Some say that patients with advanced cancer who are treated with supportive care alone will have a short but  eaceful end to their life, protected from the side-effects of chemotherapy.  *eos Our study showed that as many as 67% of patients receiving supportive care experienced severe symptoms and as a result, 63% were admitted for a median of 11 days.  *eos Furthermore, irinotecan improved the symptoms of patients and delayed the onset of  tumour-related symptoms such as performance-status deterioration, weight loss, and pain.  *eos These data were supported by the quality-of-life analysis which suggested  that the side-effects of irinotecan were favourably  balanced by reduced tumour-related events.  *eos 

We have shown a survival advantage and a clinical benefit from second-line chemotherapy in patients with  metastatic colorectal cancer no longer responding to fluorouracil.  *eos Many patients had poor prognostic factors,  which implies that the results will be applicable in the  daily practice.  *eos The value of irinotecan was confirmed in  terms of survival, quality of life, and other clinical  variables.  *eos Irinotecan can therefore be recommended as the standard second-line therapy in colorectal cancer and as a new reference for forthcoming clinical trials.   *eos
