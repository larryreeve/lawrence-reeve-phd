to be eligible for randomisation patients had to meet the following criteria histologically proven metastatic colorectal cancer progressive metastatic disease documented on the basis of either a 25 increase in the size of target lesions or an increase in carcinoembryonic antigen by 1 25 times an initial reference value and a baseline value of more than 10 ug l which allowed inclusion of patients with non measurable disease peritoneal carcinomatosis and pelvic recurrences progression documented by two measurements not separated by more than 6 months and tumour progression while on fluorouracil or within 6 months of the last fluorouracil infusion having had one adjuvant and or no more than two palliative fluorouracil based regimens age 18 75 years who performance status 0 2 neutrophils 2 10 l or more platelets 100x10 l or more total bilirubin 1 25 the institutional upper normal limit iunl or less liver transaminases 3xiunl in case of liver metastases bilirubin 1 5 iunl and transaminases 5 iunl or more serum creatinine 135 umol l or less wash out of 4 weeks for radiotherapy or chemotherapy and written informed consent 
colorectal cancer is one of the most common adult malignant tumours affecting one person in twenty in the usa and in most developed countries 
the univariate analyses of variance were significantly in favour of the irinotecan group for the cognitive functioning score p 0 001 the global quality of life score p 0 001 the pain score p 0 008 dyspnoea p 0 04 appetite loss p 0 002 and financial impact scores p 0 001 
patients with the following criteria were not eligible previous treatment with topoisomerase i inhibitors bulky disease involving more than 50 of the liver volume or 25 of the lung volume or abdominal mass 10 cm metastases in the central nervous system or unresolved bowel obstruction or diarrhoea 
in the quality of life analysis compliance of patients was about 80 in both groups at the beginning of study and decreased during the study to about 50 
in first line chemotherapy fluorouracil with folinic acid is better than supportive care or delayed chemotherapy for survival and quality of life but the value of second line chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer has not yet been proven 
in the supportive care group 28 31 of patients received chemotherapy 21 a fluorouracil regimen nine other drugs and one irinotecan 17 19 patients in the supportive care group received chemotherapy within 1 month of randomisation compared with two 1 in the irinotecan group 
within 23 weeks of randomisation the rate of patients with opioid consumption by 3 week blocks ranged from 25 to 34 in the irinotecan group and from 40 to 56 in the supportive care group 
quality of life was assessed with the european organization for research and treatment of cancer eortc qlq c30 questionnaire including five function scales one global health status scale and nine symptom scales which was filled in at baseline at 3 weeks 6 weeks and then every 6 weeks 
a retrospective stratification was planned to take into account the baseline prognostic factors sex age performance status weight loss presence of liver metastases site of primary tumour number of metastatic sites response to and duration of fluorouracil treatment as well as its intent adjuvant or palliative haemoglobin white blood cells platelets lactate dehydrogenase transaminases alkaline phosphatase bilirubin protein and carcinoembryonic antigen 
admission for adverse events occurred in 136 72 of patients in the irinotecan group and 57 63 of patients in the supportive carealone group for a cumulative median of 15 range 1 168 days and 11 2 87 days respectively 
more generally the multivariate regression showed that the difference in survival between the two groups remained significant even after adjusting for the effect of well known prognostic factors 
this result observed in a multicentre trial is probably accounted for by the more rigorous implementation of guidelines for the management of diarrhoea than in earlier studies 
the secondary objectives were the impact of treatment on performance status bodyweight tumour related symptoms and quality of life 
pain free survival in patients without pain at baseline figure 4 was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the supportive care group p 0 003 despite a higher proportion of patients on opioids in the supportive care group 
for these patients treatment with fluorouracil usually modulated by folinic acid is the only option and the median survival is 10 12 months 
the analysis of the eortc qlq c30 symptoms scale was consistent with the safety data 
irinotecan is a topoisomerase i inhibitor that blocks the dna replication step of the enzyme leading to multiple single strand dna breaks which eventually blocks cell division 
when the treatment group was included in the model the survival benefit for the irinotecan group remained significant p 0 001 
after the prognostic model had been determined the effect of treatment after adjusting for other prognostic factors was estimated by including it in the model 
two 1 1 of 183 patients treated with irinotecan died of drug related causes although in one the association with adverse events diarrhoea and or febrile neutropenia has not been clearly established 
this study showed that treatment with irinotecan and supportive care alone compared with supportive care prolonged the life of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
furthermore irinotecan improved the symptoms of patients and delayed the onset of tumour related symptoms such as performance status deterioration weight loss and pain 
these data were supported by the quality of life analysis which suggested that the side effects of irinotecan were favourably balanced by reduced tumour related events 
the value of irinotecan was confirmed in terms of survival quality of life and other clinical variables 
in phase ii studies irinotecan has objective antitumour activity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer even in those with documented fluorouracil resistant tumours with response rates of 11 23 
after discontinuation of treatment in the irinotecan group patients continued to fill in qlq c30 questionnaires every 6 weeks as in the supportive care group
