between september 1986 and december 1991 578 patients with primary invasive cervical cancer were referred to the departments of obstetrics and gynecology and radiation oncology at the istituto di scienze biomediche s gerardo university of milan monza 
we used the international federation of gynaecology and obstetrics figo clinical staging system to classify the stage of cancer 7 if there was disagreement about the stage the case was assigned to the earlier stage 468 patients had figo stage ib or iia disease 343 of these patients were enrolled after they had given their informed consent to take part 
eligibility criteria were age 30 70 years newly diagnosed stage ib or iia cervical cancer no concurrent or previous malignant disease who performance status of 1 or less and feasibility of both radical surgery and radiotherapy 
the clinical evaluation of the patients was done by the gynaecological surgeon together with the radiation oncologist to avoid bias in the randomisation in fact patients with unfavourable clinical characteristics are usually treated by radiotherapy alone 
a complete computerised plane was made according to the international commission on radiation units and measurements report no 38 8 the total dose at point a external beam plus brachyradiotherapy ranged from 70 gy to 90 gy median 76 gy 
dissection of the pelvic lymph node consisted of removal of all fatty lymph node bearing tissue anterior lateral and posterior to the common external and internal iliac vessels and anterior to the obturator nerve 
the pathologist provided us with histological subtypes grade depth of invasion tumour size presence of capillary like space involvement paracervical tissue involvement and number site and type of lymph node metastases 
adjuvant radiotherapy consisted of external pelvic irradiation 18 mv x rays with the multiportal technique one fraction of 1 8 2 0 gy daily with a total dose of 50 4 gy over 5 6 weeks 
we classified complications as grade 1 mild symptoms not affecting the patient s health and easily cured grade 2 symptoms that can be resolved by long term medical therapies grade 3 major symptoms that require surgery or invasive procedures and affect the performance status of the patient or fatal complications 
of the 468 patients with figo stage ib or iia cervical cancer 125 were excluded because of age 30 years 70 years n 43 medical illness n 54 previous or concurrent malignant disease n 21 or the referring physician s or patient s preference for surgery radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy n 7 
after randomisation there were six protocol violations two in the surgery group one progression before operation and one refusal of any therapy after randomisation and four in the radiotherapy group two patients whose cancer was incorrectly staged and two with synchronous neoplasia 
adjuvant radiotherapy was done in 62 54 of the 114 surgery group patients who had a cervical diameter of 4 cm or smaller and in 46 84 of 55 surgery group patients who had a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm 19 patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or less and three patients whose cervical diameter was greater than 4 cm had lymph vascular space involvement as the only pathological risk factor these patients did not receive postoperative irradiation 
the overall and disease free actuarial 5 year survival for all patients were 83 and 74 respectively and did not differ significantly between the groups figure 2 5 year actuarial survival stratified by cervical diameter was similar in the surgery and radiotherapy groups diameter 4 cm 87 vs 90 diameter 4 cm 70 vs 72 figure 3 table 3 5 year actuarial disease free survival for the surgery and radiotherapy groups was 80 and 82 respectively for patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or smaller and 63 and 57 for those with a diameter larger than 4 cm the between group differences were not significant 
the two groups did not differ significantly as regards squamous histotype overall 5 year survival rates were 84 in surgery group patients and 88 in radiotherapy group patients overall disease free survival was 76 and 78 respectively 
for rates of adenocarcinoma there was a significant advantage for patients who had surgery compared with those who had radiotherapy in both overall survival 70 vs 59 p 0 05 and disease free survival 66 vs 47 p 0 02 
the median time to recurrence did not differ significantly between the surgery and radiotherapy groups 20 vs 18 months p 0 24 82 of pelvic recurrences and 61 of the distant ones became evident within 2 years of the primary treatment 
of the 86 patients who developed a recurrence 50 58 had local or pelvic recurrence 22 52 in the surgery group vs 28 64 in the radiotherapy group p 0 42 and 36 42 had distant metastases 20 48 vs 16 36 p 0 62 five of these 36 patients also had a pelvic recurrence 
in addition among women with a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm there was a significantly higher rate of pelvic relapse among those who had radiotherapy than among those who had surgery plus adjuvant irradiation 16 70 vs 9 53 p 0 46 
complications were classified according to the glossary of chassagne and colleagues 10 in the surgery group 48 28 patients showed severe grade 2 3 morbidity that required medical or surgical treatment compared with 19 12 patients in the radiotherapy group p 0 0004 table 3 
hydroureteronephrosis was recorded in two 3 of 61 patients who had surgery alone 11 10 of 108 patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy and eight 5 of 158 patients who had radiotherapy alone p 0 1 
the relative risk of this complication for surgery plus radiotherapy versus surgery alone was 3 11 95 ci 0 71 13 56 and was 2 01 95 ci 0 84 4 8 for surgery plus radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone 
in the radiotherapy group one patient had intestinal perforation one rectovaginal fistula and 12 severe proctites severe oedema of the legs occurred in ten 9 patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy in one 0 6 patient who had radiotherapy alone and in none of the patients who had surgery alone 
newton5 reported that the 5 year survival rate for 119 patients with stage i disease accrued over 10 years in a partly randomised study was 81 for radical surgery and 74 for radiotherapy this difference was not significant 
morley and seski s study of 446 patients with stage ib disease recruited between 1945 and 1975 and treated with radical hysterectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy or external irradiation and brachyradiotherapy reported crude 5 year survival of 87 and 83 respectively 
on the other hand the low rate of major complications after radiotherapy 12 suggests that this approach is well tolerated by most patients 25 of the surgery group patients and 26 patients in the radiotherapy group developed neoplastic recurrence 
our study was not aimed to assess the usefulness of the postoperative treatment though our finding that patients treated with surgery plus radiotherapy were exposed to early and late complicationsof both treatments is important 
in italy a prospective randomised trial has been under way since 1993 to assess the best adjuvant treatment chemotherapy or radiotherapy for high risk patients after radical surgery for figo stage ib iia cancer 
this finding should resolve some of the conflicting approaches to this issue 14 16 our results suggest that the optimum candidates for primary radical surgery are women with normal ovarian function and cervical diameters of 4 cm or smaller whereas radiotherapy is preferable for postmenopausal women 
women whose cervical diameters are larger than 4 cm should be identified before surgery so that they can benefit from tailored treatment radical radiotherapy with the option of concomitant radiosensitising chemotherapy to improve the local control of the disease or cisplatinbased chemotherapy followed by radical surgery
