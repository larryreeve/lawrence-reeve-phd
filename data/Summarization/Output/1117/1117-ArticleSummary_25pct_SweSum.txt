By contrast, radical surgery affords the opportunity to study pathological findings, so that groups of at-risk patients who could benefit from adjuvant treatment can be identified. 468 patients had FIGO stage Ib or IIa disease. 

The patients were randomly assigned radical surgery (n=172) or radical radiotherapy (n=171). Patients were also stratified by cervical diameter (4 cm or >4 cm). Thus, 343 patients were randomised: 172 to radical surgery and 171 to radiotherapy. Therefore 170 patients in the surgery group and 167 in the radiotherapy group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. 


Ten patients crossed over treatment: one refused surgery and was irradiated, and nine refused radiotherapy and underwent surgery. Five patients in the radiotherapy group did not receive brachyradiotherapy after external irradiation because of unfavourable anatomy and subsequently underwent radical surgery. Thus, 169 in the surgery group and 158 in the radiotherapy group underwent the scheduled treatment (compliance of 98% for surgery and 92% for radiotherapy). The mean age of patients in the radiotherapy group was slightly greater than that of patients in the surgery group. Lymphangiography revealed positive nodes in 24 (14%) surgery-group patients and in 22 (13%) radiotherapy group patients. 19 patients whose cervical diameter was 4 cm or less and three patients whose cervical diameter was greater than 4 cm had lymph-vascular-space involvement as the only pathological risk factor; these patients did not receive postoperative irradiation. No patient was lost to follow-up. The status of the patients according to primary therapy and cervical diameter is shown in table 3. 5-year actuarial survival stratified by cervical diameter was similar in the surgery and radiotherapy groups (diameter < 4 cm: 87% vs 90%; diameter >4 cm: 70% vs 72%; figure 3, table 3). Overall survival for the 108 surgery-group patients who received adjuvant treatment (high-risk group) compared with the patients with surgery alone (low-risk group) or radiotherapy alone (unknown risk) is shown in figure 4, 


Overall, 86 (25·5%) patients developed recurrent disease: 42 (25%) in the surgery group and 44 (26%) in the radiotherapy group. Of these 86 patients, 60 (70%) died of disease. Three patients with recurrence died of intercurrent disease (one after successful treatment of the recurrence). Among the patients who developed recurrent disease, six (14%) in the surgery group and 13 (30%) in the radiotherapy group were cured; this difference was not significant (p=0·15). Of the 86 patients who developed a recurrence, 50 (58%) had local or pelvic recurrence (22 [52%] in the surgery group vs 28 [64%] in the radiotherapy group, p=0·42), and 36 (42%) had distant metastases (20 [48%] vs 16 [36%], p=0·62); five of these 36 patients also had a pelvic recurrence. In addition, among women with a cervical diameter larger than 4 cm, there was a significantly higher rate of pelvic relapse among those who had radiotherapy than among those who had surgery plus adjuvant irradiation (16 [70%] vs 9 [53%], p=0·46). Thus, 169 patients in the surgery group and 158 in the radiotherapy group were included in this analysis. Complications were classified according to the glossary of Chassagne and colleagues.10 In the surgery group, 48 (28%) patients showed severe (grade 2–3) morbidity that required medical or surgical treatment, compared with 19 (12%) patients in the radiotherapy group, (p=0·0004; table 3). Grade 2 or 3 complications affected 19 (31%) patients who had surgery alone and 29 (27%) patients who received surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy (p=0·71). Hydroureteronephrosis was recorded in: two (3%) of 61 patients who had surgery alone; 11 (10%) of 108 patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy; and eight (5%) of 158 patients who had radiotherapy alone (p=0·1). The relative risk of this complication for surgery plus radiotherapy versus surgery alone was 3·11 (95% CI 0·71–13·56) and was 2·01 (95% CI 0·84–4·8%) for surgery plus radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone. Chronic neurological bladder was observed in eight (13%) patients who had surgery alone and in five (5%) patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy. Other vesical complications (severe actinic cystitis, stress incontinence, high-pressure bladder) were recorded in two (3%) patients after surgery, 11 (10%) after surgery plus radiotherapy, and in eight (5%) after radiotherapy alone. Ileal obstruction occurred in six (5%) patients who underwent surgery plus radiotherapy and in two (1%) who received radical radiotherapy. In the radiotherapy group, one patient had intestinal perforation, one rectovaginal fistula, and 12 severe proctites.Severe oedema of the legs occurred in ten (9%) patients who had surgery plus radiotherapy, in one (0·6%) patient who had radiotherapy alone, and in none of the patients who had surgery alone. Pelvic lymphocyst occurred in five (8%) patients after surgery and in five (15%) after surgery plus radiotherapy. Abdominal hernia occurred in seven patients, of whom four received surgery alone and three received surgery plus radiotherapy. Complications after radiotherapy arise later than after surgery, although radiotherapy-related complications are often permanent. 25% of the surgery-group patients and 26% patients in the radiotherapy group developed neoplastic recurrence. Adjuvant radiotherapy was prospectively planned in patients at high risk of relapse. Clinical prognostic factors can prove useful to select those patients who should be treated primarily by irradiation, reserving surgery for patients who do not need adjuvant treatment.
