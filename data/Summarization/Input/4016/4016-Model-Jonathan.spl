Irinotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor that blocks the DNA replication step of the enzyme , leading to multiple single-strand DNA breaks ,  which eventually blocks cell division .
In phase II studies ,  irinotecan has objective antitumour activity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer ,  even in those with documented fluorouracil-resistant tumours ,  with response rates of 11.23% .
The trial we report was started in 1995 to compare irinotecan with supportive care alone for survival ,  quality of life ,  and other clinical variables .
The participants were patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in whom fluorouracil chemotherapy had failed .
Overall survival was the primary endpoint .
The secondary objectives were the impact of treatment on performance status ,  bodyweight , tumour-related symptoms ,  and quality of life .
To be eligible for randomisation ,  patients had to meet the following criteria ,  histologically proven metastatic colorectal cancer ,  progressive metastatic disease documented on the basis of either a 25% increase in the size of target lesions or an increase in carcinoembryonic antigen by 1.25 times an initial reference value and a baseline value of more than 10 ug/L ,  which allowed inclusion of patients with non-measurable disease (peritoneal carcinomatosis and pelvic recurrences) ,  progression documented by two measurements not separated by more than 6 months and tumour progression while on fluorouracil or within 6 months of the last fluorouracil infusion ,  having had one adjuvant and/or no more than two palliative fluorouracil-based regimens ,  age 18-75 years ,  WHO performance status 0.2 ,  neutrophils 2 10/L or more ,  platelets 100x10/L or more ,  total bilirubin 1.25 the institutional upper normal limit (IUNL) ,  or less ,  liver transaminases 3xIUNL (in case of liver metastases ,  bilirubin <=1.5 IUNL and transaminases <=5 IUNL) ,  or more ,  serum creatinine 135 umol/L or less ,  wash-out of 4 weeks for radiotherapy or chemotherapy ,  and written informed consent .
Patients with the following criteria were not eligible ,  previous treatment with topoisomerase I inhibitors ,  bulky disease (involving more than 50% of the liver volume or 25% of the lung volume ,  or abdominal mass >=10 cm) ,  metastases in the central nervous system ,  or unresolved bowel obstruction or diarrhoea .
In the irinotecan group ,  patients were given best supportive care and irinotecan 350 mg/m ,  diluted in 250 mL normal saline or dextrose ,  over a 90 min intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (or 300 mg/m if aged >=70 years or WHO performance status 2 ,  according to previously recognised risk factors for developing toxicity) .
Supportive care included antibiotics ,  analgesics ,  transfusions ,  corticosteroids ,  or any other symptomatic therapy (except iriontecan or other topoisomerase I inhibitor) ,  and/or assistance of a psychotherapist .
Quality of life was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire (including five function scales ,  one global health-status scale ,  and nine symptom scales) ,  which was filled in at baseline ,  at 3 weeks ,  6 weeks ,  and then every 6 weeks .
A retrospective stratification was planned to take into account the baseline prognostic factors (sex ,  age ,  performance status ,  weight loss ,  presence of liver metastases ,  site of primary tumour ,  number of metastatic sites ,  response to and duration of fluorouracil treatment as well as its intent [adjuvant or palliative] ,  haemoglobin ,  white blood cells ,  platelets ,  lactate dehydrogenase ,  transaminases ,  alkaline phosphatase ,  bilirubin ,  protein ,  and carcinoembryonic antigen) .
189 patients were randomly allocated irinotecan and supportive care and 90 patients were allocated supportive care alone (figure 1) .
Irinotecan was given for a median of 4.1 (0.7-12.6) months and 172 (91%) patients received their first infusion within 8 days of randomisation .
40 (21%) patients in the irinotecan group received subsequent anticancer chemotherapies (31 a fluorouracil regimen ,  nine a drug other than irinotecan) .
In the supportive- care group 28 (31%) of patients received chemotherapy (21 a fluorouracil regimen ,  nine other drugs ,  and one irinotecan) .
17 (19%) patients in the supportive-care group received chemotherapy within 1 month of randomisation compared with two (1%) in the irinotecan group .
Patients in the irinotecan group lived significantly longer than those in the supportive-care group (p=0.0001) .
This study showed that treatment with irinotecan and supportive care alone ,  compared with supportive care ,  prolonged the life of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer .
This benefit was clinically meaningful because the probability of surviving 1 year was 2.6 times greater in patients given irinotecan compared with that of patients given supportive care alone .
Other efficacy endpoints ,  such as survival without weight loss ,  survival without performance status deterioration ,  pain-free survival ,  and quality-of-life ,  were all significantly in favour of irinotecan .
The survival advantage for the irinotecan group remained highly significant after adjustment of performance status ,  a well-recognised prognostic factor .
The study also showed an advantage for irinotecan for quality of life .
The safety profile of irinotecan was acceptable .
The incidence of treatment-related grade 3 or 4 diarrhoea with irinotecan (21%) was lower than that reported in previous studies (39%) .
Grade 3.4 neutropenia was reported in 22% and grade 3.4 vomiting in 14% of patients .
We have shown a survival advantage and a clinical benefit from second-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer no longer responding to fluorouracil .
The value of irinotecan was confirmed in terms of survival ,  quality of life ,  and other clinical variables .
Irinotecan can therefore be recommended as the standard second-line therapy in colorectal cancer and as a new reference for forthcoming clinical trials .
