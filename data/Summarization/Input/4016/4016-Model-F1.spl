A very well performed randomized study that was the first phase III trial to demonstrate a benefit of chemotherapy versus best supportive care in patients with advanced colorectal cancer who have failed 5FU based therapy .
The study is adequately powered and analyzes survival as well as many critical quality of life issues .
The only weakness of the study is the fact that almost one third of the best supportive care group received chemotherapy within 1 month of starting the study .
Despite this , a survival benefit is still clearly shown .
