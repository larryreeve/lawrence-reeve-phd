The adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of bleomycin, vincristine, mitomycin, and cisplatin (BOMP). Although 25.5% of patients achieved a complete reponse following three courses of BOMP and 47% obtained a complete reponse after CT and RT, the 5-year overall survival was significantly inferior in the CT/RT group compared to the control arm, RT(23% vs 39%). Toxicity was pronounced in the CT/RT arm.  There were 4 deaths attributed to the acute bleomycin toxicity.
