30|A|ALTHOUGH much progress has been made in the early detection and control of carcinoma of the cervix since the introduction of the Papanicolau test , it is estimated that about 13,500 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 1990 in the United States with 6,000 patients dying from the disease .
5|I|While surgery and radiotherapy (RT) are equally effective in early-stage disease , radiation therapy has been the primary treatment modality for stage III disease , with 5-year survival rates between 30% to 45% being reported .
24|I|Attempts to improve these results , including the use of hypoxic cell sensitizers , hyperbaric oxygen therapy , and neutron therapy have met with limited or no success .
23|I|The role of chemotherapy (CT) , either as a single agent or in combination , has been extensively evaluated in advanced or recurrent disease . 
3|I|The use of upfront CT as initial treatment before pelvic RT would be theoretically advantageous as the vascular supply to the tumor is not compromised , allowing a higher local tissue concentration of drugs , thereby improving the effectiveness of CT .
2|I|To test this  hypothesis , we began in 1984 at the Instituto Nacional de Cancer (Rio de Janeiro , Brazil) a prospective randomized trial comparing neoadjuvant BOMP CT followed by pelvic RT (CT + RT) versus pelvic RT alone in patients with stage IIIB carcinoma of  the cervix .
14|M|Between April 1984 and August 1986 , 107 previously untreated patients with stage III B carcinoma of the cervix were entered on the study .
7|M|The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging criteria were used in this study .
25|M|In  the CT + RT group , 11 refused further therapy , including pelvic RT , after only one cycle of CT , and two others were found to have abnormal renal function after randomization and before commencement of treatment .
26|M|Three in the RT arm refused further treatment after only a few fractions of irradiation were delivered .
27|M|Thus , there were 39 assessable patients in the CT + RT  arm and 52 in the RT arm .
28|M|Chemotherapy consisted of bleomycin 15 U intramuscularly (IM) every 12 hours from days 1 to 4 (total dose , 120 U) , vincristine 1 mg/m2 IV on day 1 , mitomycin 10 mg/im 2 IV on day 1 , and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1 , given on an outpatient basis every 3 weeks for three cycles .
29|M|RT was started 3 to 4 weeks after completion of the third cycle .
8|M|A CR was defined as the complete resolution of all  measurable disease and symptoms , a partial response (PR) was defined as a 50% or more decrease in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of measurable disease , and stable disease (SD) was defined as less than a 50% decrease in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of the measurable lesions .
9|M|Disease status was evaluated by pelvic examination and by appropriate radiologic and laboratory investigations .
22|M|All patients were observed to determine the efficiency of the combined therapy by comparing overall survival , rate of local control , incidence of distant metastases , and toxicity between treatment regimens .
10|M|Patients were randomly allocated to the two treatment arms by drawing cards in sealed envelopes .
11|M|Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and was measured from day 1 of therapy until last follow-up or death .
31|R|The CR rate was 32.5% and 47% (P = .19) for the RT and CT + RT , respectively .
32|R|For the partial responders , 57% in the RT arm and 37.5% in the CT + RT are alive with no evidence of disease progression at a minimum follow-up time of 3 years .
12|R|Median survivals were 25 months in the RT arm and 10.5 months in the CT + RT .
13|R|The 5-year survival rates for the complete responders were 57% and 36% for the RT and CT + RT groups , respectively .
33|R|Pelvic disease remains the major site of failure , with at least 50% of the patients failing within the irradiated volume .
6|D|Acute toxicity was pronounced in the combined treatment arm (Table 6) .
15|D|Of greater concern was the bleomycin-related pulmonary toxicity .
16|D|Five patients (13%) developed such a complication, and four died as a direct result .
17|D|This study was designed with the objective of answering the question of whether neoadjuvant BOMP chemotherapy is effective in stage III B carcinoma of the cervix .
18|R|Although 25.5% of the patients achieved a CR following three cycles of BOMP and 47% of the CT + RT group obtained a CR at the  end of RT , the 5-year overall survival was significantly inferior in the CT + RT group than in the control arm (39% v 21% , P  = .02) .
19|D|The reason for this surprising and disturbing finding is not entirely clear .
20|D|The most likely explanation for the poorer results in these neoadjuvant trials is the enhancement of accelerated tumor cell proliferation during treatment .
21|D|The mechanisms by which this increased cell proliferation occurs are not entirely clear , although , as suggested by Tannock , it may result from improved nutrition of surviving cells following shrinkage of the tumor due to previous therapy .
1|D|At present , there is no evidence to support the use of upfront CT before pelvic irradiation in stage III B cervical cancer .
34|D|In fact , this approach might be detrimental , as demonstrated in the present study .
4|D|The high toxicity rate of BOMP CT , in the  dose and schedule used in this study , makes this combination unacceptable for routine use .
