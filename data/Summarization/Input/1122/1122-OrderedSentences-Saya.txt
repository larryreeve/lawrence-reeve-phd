16|I|The preferred treatment of women with early-stage cervical cancer (FIGO IA2-IIA) is radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy .
15|I|Chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation has been studied in our institution in a prospective Phase II trial , with an apparent improvement in survival rates when compared to historical controls .
1|I|In an effort to determine whether the improved survival in the Memorial Hospital Phase II trial was due to the combination of chemotherapy plus pelvic radiation therapy or due to the effect of the chemotherapy alone , a multicenter randomized Phase III clinical trial was designed .
3|M|Patients who met the entry criteria were given the opportunity to participate in this clinical trial , entry and initiation of therapy had to be within 6 weeks of the date of radical hysterectomy .
11|M|One arm consisted of 2 cycles of chemotherapy (given 3-4 weeks apart) utilizing bleomycin 20 U/m2/day via continuous 24-hr infusion on Days 1-3 after an initial intravenous bolus of 20 U/m2 followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 by iv infusion on Day 4 .
12|M|Following recovery from the second cycle of chemotherapy , patients received a course of whole pelvic radiation therapy to a dose of 45 Gy , delivered in 20 fractions via a four-field technique , patients did not receive intravaginal therapy .
13|M|Two additional cycles of cisplatin alone (75 mg/m2) were prescribed after completion of the pelvic radiation therapy . 
14|M|In the second arm of the study , patients were randomized to treatment with a similar regimen of chemotherapy as described above without pelvic radiation , following the first two cycles of cisplatin and bleomycin , the patient then received the third and fourth treatment of cisplatin alone at 3-to 4-week intervals . 
4|M|Overall and disease-free survival curves were computed using the method of Kaplan-Meier and the differences in survival were compared by the log-rank method .
5|D|Toxicity was tolerable in the two treatment arms .
6|R|The risk factors did not appear to be additive , since the disease-free and overall survival were similar when patients with 1-2 risk factors were compared to those patients with 3 or more risk factors .
7|R|The initial statistical prediction was that in order to show a 20% improvement in survival of one treatment over the other , 80 patients were needed in each treatment arm .
2|R|The analysis of the data from the 89 patients entered is not able to document that the two treatments are equivalent , but must be taken to suggest that the likelihood of finding a significant difference between these two treatment modalities in a full trial of 160 patients is small .
8|D|The advantages of eliminating the radiation therapy component of postoperative therapy are apparent in that the duration of treatment is shorter , costs are reduced , and the long-term side effects of pelvic radiotherapy after radical pelvic surgery are eliminated .
9|D|Additionally , if the patient does experience a local or regional recurrence after chemotherapy , pelvic radiation therapy still has curative potential .
10|D|Investigators who design adjuvant trials for patients at high risk for recurrence after radical hysterectomy for invasive cervical cancer must balance the potential benefit to be gained by a minority of patients against the risks inherent in treating all patients .
