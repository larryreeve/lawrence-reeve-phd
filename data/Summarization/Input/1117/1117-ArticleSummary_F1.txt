The five year actuarial survival stratified by cervical diameter was similar in the two groups. In tumors less than 4cm, 87% for surgery and 90% for radiotherapy. In tumors greater than 4cm, 70% for surgery and 72% for radiotherapy. The five year disease free survival for the surgery and radiotherapy groups was 80% and 82% in tumors less than 4cm and 63% and 57% in tumors greater than 4 cm. These results were not statistically significant.
