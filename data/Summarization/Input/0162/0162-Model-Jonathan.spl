For this reason ,  in September 1975 ,  we started a new prospective study  with the intent to evaluate the possibility of reducing the duration of  adjuvant CMF without compromising the therapeutic effect of combined treatment .
The preliminary 3-yr results have shown that in premenopausal women ,  6 cycles of CMF yielded results that were identical to those obtained  with 12 cycles .
This article presents the 5-yr results achieved in our study .
Between September 1975 and May 1978 ,  a total of 466 consecutive  patients were entered into a prospective randomized study .
Within 4 wk from surgery ,  patients with TI-3a breast cancer ,   histologically positive axillary nodes ,  age < 70 yr ,  and living fairly close to the Institute were allocated to receive either 12 or 6 cycles of CMF .
Based on the 3-yr analysis of our first CMF study showing an apparent  lack of therapeutic advantage following adjuvant chemotherapy in  postmenopausal women ,  randomization for this group of patients was discontinued at the  end of November 1976. The dose schedule of CMF was as follows ,  cyclophosphamide (CTX) 100  mg/sq m by mouth from day 1 to day 14 ,  methotrexate (MTX) 40 mg/sq m  intravenously on days 1 and 8 ,  and fluorouracil (FU) 600 mg/sq m intravenously on  days 1 and 8. Therefore ,  a total of 459 patients were found evaluable for treatment comparison ,  i.e. ,  243 women (premenopausal 160 ,  postmenopausal 83)  allocated in the 12-cycle group and 216 (premenopausal 164 ,  postmenopausal 52) in  the 6-cycle group ,  respectively .
ER tumors were considered positive in 177 patients (69.4%) ,  negative in  47 (18.4%) ,  while the remaining tumors (12.2%) were considered to have borderline values .
The median follow-up at the time of present analysis was 56 mo for the entire series of 459 evaluable patients .
Figure 1 shows that the comparative RFS at 5 yr was practically  identical in the two treatment groups (CMF 12 ,  59% ,  CMF 6 ,  65.6% ,  p =0.17) .
It appears evident that treatment regimens were unable to significantly affect the RFS within each patient subset .
It is important to emphasize that overall no RFS difference was  documented between preand postmenopausal patients (CMF 12 ,  59.3% versus 57.6% ,  CMF  6 ,  66.5% versus 63.1% , respectively) .
On the contrary ,  in both treatmentand menopausal groups ,  RFS was  affected by the number of involved nodes (Table 1) .
In fact ,  premenopausal patients in the 12-cycle group had a 72% 5-yr survival compared to 77.1% for women in the 6-cycle group (p = 0.20) .
No difference in the pattern of treatment failure was evident between  the treatment groups (Table 2) .
No substantial difference was also documented in the pattern of new  disease manifestations ,  either local-regional or distant ,  between pre- and postmenopausal women .
As can be seen ,  RFS was superior in patients with ER + tumors ,  but this difference failed to reach statistical significance in all patient  subsets .
Also ,  no difference was evident when overall survival of postmenopausal women was examined (ER+ 82.5% versus ER- 76.2% ,  p =0.32) .
By contrast ,  premenopausal women with ER + tumors had a significantly  longer survival than their matches with ER- tumors (79.9% versus 67.6% ,  p =  0.03) .
However ,  in spite of the fact that frequency of objective remission was superimposable (-30%) in both ER groups regardless of treatment  administered and site(s) of first involvement ,  the disease in ER + tumors had amore indolent course ,  while ER - tumors showed further progression within a  few months .
Myelosuppression represented the dose-limiting factor in the large  majority of patients (70%-80%) ,  but severe leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia  were rare (10%) ,  and prolonged myelosuppression beyond the fourth week from  drug discontinuation was never observed .
The 5-yr results of the present study are now sufficiently mature to indicate with confidence that 6 cycles of CMF are equivalent to 12  cycles in terms of RFS and total survival .
In fact ,  in all variables examined ,  none of the two treatments under evaluation was significantly different from the other .
The observation that in some patient subsets 6 cycles of CMF yielded apparently superior results to 12 cycles is probably related to the  relative number of patients in each group and to the different median follow-up  in postmenopausal women  whose accrual was discontinued in December 1976. Our data suggest that the main important pharmacologic factor affecting tumor response is the peak level of drugs administered and not their  total amount .
Thus ,  all above reported findings strongly support our preliminary 3-yr results and indicate that utilizing a single multidrug regimen ,  it is possible to reduce the duration of adjuvant treatment in operable  breast cancer without compromising the therapeutic results .
It appears evident that ,  (A) the two series given 12 cycles of CMF  achieved the same results ,  (B) the data reported in the three series treated  with CMF are almost equivalent ,  (C) adjuvant CMF ,  whether administered for 12 or  6 cycles ,  was able to alter the course of operable breast cancer with  positive axillary lymph nodes compared to the group subjected to radical  mastectomy alone .
The first and most important one is that there appears to be no real difference following adjuvant chemotherapy ,  namely CMF ,  between the RFS  of pre- versus postmenopausal women (CMF 12 ,  59.3% versus 57.6% ,  CMF 6 ,   66.5% versus 63.1% ,  respectively) .
Effective adjuvant combination chemotherapy seems to be unaffected by  ER status ,  at least when RFS is considered .
Based on our current findings ,  i.e. ,  therapeutic efficacy of adjuvant  CMF regardless of ER status ,  there seems to be no clinical reason to  withhold the administration of adjuvant combination chemotherapy in node  positive women even in the presence of ER + tumors .
The most important practical aspect of our current study is at which  point a single drug combination has provided all the benefit possible ,  i.e. ,   maximal tumor cytoreduction ,  in the majority of patients .
Our clinical findings from anadjuvant treatment support this conclusion  and indicate that the maximum therapeutic effect can be obtained with 6 or probably less than 6 cycles of CMF .
In conclusion ,  the 5-yr results of our randomized study confirm that  CMF ,  particularly when delivered at nearly full doses ,  can indeed alter the postoperative course of breast cancer with positive axillary nodes .
The presence of specifically multidrug-resistant phenotypes limits the therapeutic effectiveness of a single combination and renders its  prolonged administration unnecessary .
