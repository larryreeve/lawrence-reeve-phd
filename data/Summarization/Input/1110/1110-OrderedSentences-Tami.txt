28|M|In 1990 , the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) began a randomized clinical trial to compare the effects on survival of treatment with extended-field radiation and treatment with pelvic radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in patients with cervical cancer .
29|M|We report the first results of this study .
19|M|We enrolled women of all ages who had stages IIB through IVA squamous-cell carcinoma , adenocarcinoma , or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix according to the staging system of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (Table 1) or stage IB or IIA of one of these cancers with a tumor diameter of at least 5 cm or biopsy-proved metastasis to pelvic lymph nodes .
20|M|The patients in each treatment group were stratified according to the tumor stage (IB , IIA , or IIB vs. III or IVA) and the staging method used for para-aortic lymph nodes (clinical vs. surgical) .
21|M|External-beam radiation was delivered with anteroposterior and posteroanterior opposed beams of at least 15-MV photons or the use of four fields (anteroposterior , posteroanterior , and two lateral fields) of at least 4-MV photons .
22|M|The first intracavitary treatment was performed before or during external-beam radiotherapy , and additional external-beam therapy was delivered with a midline block .
23|M|The protocol specified that all patients receive a total cumulative dose to point A (a reference location 2 cm lateral and 2 cmsuperior to the cervical os) of at least 85 Gy .
24|M|Within 16 hours after the first radiation fraction was administered , patients in the combination-therapy group received the first cycle of chemotherapy , which consisted of an intravenous infusion of 75 mg of cisplatin per square meter of body-surface area over a 4-hour period followed by an intravenous infusion of 4000 mg of fluorouracil per square meter over a 96-hour period .
25|M|Two additional cycles of chemotherapy were scheduled at three-week intervals .
26|M|Overall survival was the primary end point for the comparison of the two treatments and was calculated from the date of study entry until the date of death or the date of the last follow-up visit .
27|M|Disease- free survival was also compared in the two groups and was calculated from the date of study entry to the date of the first occurrence of disease progression , a second diagnosis of cancer , or death from any cause , or if none of these events occurred , to the date of the last follow-up visit .
14|R|A total of 403 patients were enrolled in the study between September 1990 and November 1997 , 201 were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy , and 202 were assigned to receive radiotherapy alone .
15|R|The 388 remaining patients (195 in the combined-therapy group and 193 in the radiotherapy group) form the basis of this analysis .
16|R|Radiotherapy was delivered according to the protocol or with minor deviations in 83 percent of the patients in the combined-therapy group and 84 percent of those in the radiotherapy group .
17|R|Of the 195 patients in the combination-therapy group , 159 (81 percent) completed at least two cycles of chemotherapy , and 133 (68 percent) completed three cycles .
13|R|Although moderate (grade 3) and severe (grade 4) side effects occurred more frequently during or within 60 days after the completion of treatment with combined therapy than with radiotherapy alone , these effects were usually self-limited or resolved with medical management (Table 3) .
18|R|The median duration of follow-up was 43 months .
5|R|Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that overall survival rates were significantly better among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy than among those treated with radiotherapy alone (73 percent vs. 58 percent , P=0.004) (Table 5 and Fig. 1) .
6|R|Disease-free survivalat five years was 67 percent in the combined-therapy group and 40 percent in the radiotherapy group , according to Kaplan–Meier analysis (P<0.001) (Fig. 2) .
7|R|The rates of distant relapse were 14 percent in the combined-therapy group and 33 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) , with a relative risk of relapse of 0.39 (95 percent confidence interval , 0.24 to 0.63) in the combined-therapy group .
8|R|The rate of locoregional recurrences was 19 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 35 percent in the radiotherapy group (P<0.001) , with a relative risk of locoregional recurrences of 0.47 (95 percent confidence interval , 0.31 to 0.71) in the combined-therapy group .
11|R|Approximately 70 percent of the patients assigned to each group had stage IB , IIA , or IIB disease .
12|R|For these patients , overall survival was significantly better if they were treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy .
9|R|There was no significant difference in overall survival between treatment groups among patients who had stage III or IVA disease , although  the study was not designed to have a sufficient number of patients in these subgroups to test for a statistically significant difference .
10|R|For patients with stage III or IVA disease , the five-year disease-free survival rates were 58 percent in the combinedtherapy group and 38 percent in the radiotherapy group (P=0.13) .
1|D|We found that the combination of pelvic radiation and concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil was more effective for locally advanced cervical cancer than pelvic and para-aortic radiation alone .
2|D|The inclusion of chemotherapy substantially reduced both local and distant recurrences of cervical cancer , leading to higher overall and disease-free survival rates .
3|D|Although chemotherapy  increased the hematologic toxicity , this effect was reversible and the incidence of late side effects was similar in the two treatment groups .
4|D|We believe there is now sufficient evidence to recommend that women with locally advanced cervical cancer confined to the pelvis receive pelvic radiation concomitantly with treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil .
