The 5-year analysis had shown that a short ,  albeit intensive ,  postoperative course of antibody treatment (900 mg total  dose) significantly reduced the appearance of distant metastases ,  but did not affect the rate of local relapses .
Now ,  after a median observation time of 7 years ,  with only four of 185 patients monitored for less than 5 years ,  the study has matured and continues to demonstrate a significant benefit with regard to survival .
The multicenter study consisted of six academic centers in former West Germany A total of 189 patients were randomized ,  with the first patient entered in May 1985 and the last in Apnl 1990 The study was closed in December 1992 ,  and we present here the final status with median  follow-up data of 7 years Eligible patients were required to have histologically confirmed adenocarcmoma of colon or the rectum with spread to regional  lymph nodes (Dukes' C or International Unimon Agamst Cancer [UICC] stage III)  In addition ,  hlstopathologic confirmation of curative resection (R0) was secured Radical tumor resection was performed by a standardized  technique agreed upon by all participating centers When located within 15 cm of  the anal verge ,  a tumor was classified as rectal carcinoma Patients were  less than 70 years old and had a Karnofsky index greater than 50% Eleven of  99 patients randomized to treatment refused their treatment assignment ,   but were otherwise considered eligible for the study .
After confirmation of histology and R0 resection of lymph node  metastasis ,  patients were randomized into two groups one received 17-lA treatment ,  whereas the other served as observation controls .
Patients in both groups were monitored in exactly the same way ,  with 14 prospectively defined follow-up visits ,  first on a quarterly and later  on a half-year basis Follow-up evaluation continued beyond 5 years at yearly  time points ,  but without formal protocol requirements .
For the end point analysis ,  standardized and objectively verifiable  dates were used for all patients ,  e ,  time point of surgery up to death of all cause or date of last contact alive for overall survival analysis In a separate analysis ,  cancer-related mortality was assessed ,  e ,  death  without recurrence was not counted as an event .
A documented histologic or radiologic diagnosis of disease was   required to confirm local or distant recurrence ,  whereas abnormal CEA values were  not used as evidence of relapse .
The 17-1A antibody ,  a munne monoclonal mmunoglobulin IgG2a antibody ,  orginally described by Herlyn has a distinct antitumor effect on human xenografted tumors in a nude mouse model Clnical-grade antibody was purchased from the Wistar Institute (Philadelphia ,  PA) ,  with support by  the German Cancer Aid (Bonn ,  Germany) .
A final status of 185 patients could be obtained for this analysis .
The death rate of the observed group was 63% (48 of 76 ,  95% CI ,  range ,   48 to 78) of patients and that of the treated group was 43% (39 of 90 ,  95%  CI ,  range ,  31 to 58) .
Thus ,  treatment with antibody led to a relative reduction of mortality  by 32% (hazards ratio ,  0.57 ,  95% confidence interval ,  8% to 51%) .
The KaplanMeier survival curves (Fig 1A) showed a significant benefit  for patients who received antibody over those who did not receive treatment  (P < .01 with Cox's proportional hazard model corrected for influence of prognostic variables ,  and P = .01 with log-rank test for the univariate analysis) .
Also ,  the intention-to-treat analysis (Fig B) on all 185 patients  showed a significant overall benefit for the treated group (P < .01 with Cox's multivariate analysis ,  and P = .02 with log-rank test for the univanate analysis) .
The median survival time before death after recurrence was 1.4 years  for patients randomized to treatment with 17-1A and 1.2 years for patients  in the observed group .
According to the disease-free interval analysis ,  tumor recurred in 96  of 166 eligible patients after 7 years of follow-up evaluation ,  thus ,  three  more recurrences were recorded m the treatment group and one more in the observation arm .
The calculated recurrence rate was 68% (49 of 76 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  53 to  82) m the control group and 52% (47 of 90 ,  95% CI ,  range ,  39 to 67) in the  17-1A group .
In summary ,  46% of patients (41 of 90) in the treatment group are at  nsk at 7 years and only 29% of patients (22 of 76) m the observed group are  alive without recurrence .
When the two groups were compared with regard to the site of first recurrence ,  the 7-year data similar to the 5-year analysis show that significantly fewer distant recurrences occur in patients treated with  the antibody than in the control arm (Fig 3) .
Therefore ,  the proposition is holding up that treatment with 17-1A may preferentially act on isolated tumor cells and thus prevent outgrowth  of distant metastases .
However ,  local relapses that occurred as the first sign of progressive disease (Fig 4) were not reduced (P = .86 with Cox multivanate  analysis) .
As shown in Table 2 ,  there is an excess of local recurrences in the treatment group ,  which may partially be explained by the longer  survival of treated patients .
There were no late treatment-related fatalities or life-threatening conditions ,  or any evidence for chronic drug-related side effects .
As the 7-year median follow-up data confirm the previously reported  5-year findings ,  the conclusion seems warranted that antibody treatment  improves the chances of curatively operated patients .
In the univariate and multivanate analyses ,  the P values for overall survival are statistically significant for the eligible as well as intention-to-treat cohort .
The conspicuous inefficacy of the antibody on local recurrences (Fig 4)  may account for the smaller P values in the disease-free-interval analysis .
Local recurrences may not affect the overall survival curve to the same degree as distant metastases do (Fig 3) ,  therefore ,  survival at 7 years appears to be superior to the disease-free interval .
Since these forms of therapy were administered only to the control  group ,  a bias may have been introduced that influenced the outcome against the antibody treatment ,  which explains the apparent difference seen m the  local recurrence rate (Table 2) .
For the immediate future ,  adding antibody to chemotherapy seems logical  to attack both dormant ,  as well as proliferating ,  metastatic tumor cells .
In conclusion ,  the presented results still support the original  hypothesis that minimal residual disease occurring so frequently in patients with  sohd tumors appears to be an indication for antibody therapy .
