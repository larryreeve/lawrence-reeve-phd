32|I|Radical external beam plus intracavitary radiation continues to be the standard therapy for advanced cervical cancer to which all new therapies must be compared .
33|I|No substantial improvements have been made in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer in the past two decades .
34|I|An analysis of the patterns of failure after radiation therapy in locally advanced cervical cancer reveals that of those who recur over 70% have some component of pelvic failure as the first site of relapse and two-thirds develop some component of distant disease . 
35|I|Many investigations are ongoing to identify more effective treatment .
36|I|Concurrent chemotherapy with radiation offers a number of theoretical advantages over those of the neoadjuvant strategy .
37|I|Theoretical disadvantages of concurrent administration include increased acute toxicity which might limit or delay the delivery of definitive irradiation or increased late toxicity particularly if the drugs and radiation do not exhibit ''toxicity'' independence .
4|I|Interest in infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with or without other agents such as mitomycin C and cisplatin , developed from both laboratory data suggesting enhanced tumor cell kill over radiation alone and clinical data .
5|I|In vitro data suggested that the addition of infusional 5-FU to radiation therapy would enhance the radiation effect .
31|I|The optimal dosing schedule for maximizing cell kill with infusional 5-FU and radiation remains undefined , but laboratory data suggested greater effects with increasing dose and prolonged exposure to 5-FU and when drug was present for intervals in excess of 48 h after radiation .
6|M|Between May of 1987 and August of 1995 , 234 patients predominantly from two centers , with others participating , were stratified by their extent of pelvic disease and randomized to receive one of four possible treatments .
7|M|Stratification was based on a retrospective analyses which defined subgroups with different prognoses based on a combination of FIGO stage and pelvic disease volume .
8|M|Patients were randomized to receive either (a) standard external beam pelvic irradiation (EBRT) in a dose of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions defined at 100% versus , (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional intravenous 5-FU in a dose of 1 g/m2 daily on the first and last 4 days of RT , (c) partially hyperfractionated RT , 5280 cGy in 33 fractions , 2 fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of RT , or (d) arm (c) with the same infusional 5-FU .
38|M|Intracavitary irradiation was to be delivered as soon after external beam therapy as possible using a linear source without colpostats , usually of cesium-137 .
39|M|Where possible , chemotherapy infusion was given on four consecutive days without a weekend break .
9|M|The outcomes of interest in this study were pelvic control , survival , and disease-free survival , as well as the serious late complication rate .
10|M|The ''Lifetest Procedure'' in SAS UNIX was used to compare survival curves .
11|M|This procedure uses the Kaplan-Meier method that calculates the ranked test pooled across the strata adjusting for strata differences .
40|M|The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate median follow-up duration , censoring patients who died .
12|M|Cox's proportional hazards model was used to examine the variables which might contribute to pelvic control or survival within stratum 1 .
13|R|There is no significant difference in the overall 5-year disease-free survival between the treatment arms .
30|R|There is a trend in favor of standard radiation and 5-FU .
14|R|There was a significant improvement in 5-year survival and disease-free survival for those treated with standard radiation and 5-FU compared to the other treatments (log rank test P 5 0.05) .
15|R|The actuarial 5-year disease-free survival was 76% compared to 65% for hyperfractionated irradiation plus 5-FU , 58% for hyperfractionated irradiation alone , and 39% for standard radiation .
16|R|Similar differences were observed in pelvic control , but the addition of 5-FU to standard radiation resulted in a greater improvement in disease-free survival than in pelvic control .
29|R|It was hoped that the use of two treatments daily during the 5-FU infusion would increase any opportunity for 5-FU-radiation interaction by increasing the total amount of radiation given concurrently with 5-FU .
18|R|The 5-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 62% for those treated with hyperfractionated irradiation and was not significantly different from the 58% survival of those treated with standard irradiation .
17|R|There was no apparent increase in late complications associated with the addition of 5-FU .
28|D|Given the low incidence of late complications it is not possible to establish an actuarial probability of risk with these regimens .
19|M|The median duration of follow up on this series at 59 months is sufficient to observe approximately 80% of expected events .
41|D|Other than the report on the use of concurrent hydroxyurea this is the first published report of the results of a randomized study examining the role of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation in advanced cervical cancer .
22|D|To reach the conclusion that concurrent chemotherapy truly adds benefit to results achievable with radiation alone , it is important that the radiation be delivered in an optimal manner with adequate doses at ''Point A'' (80 to 90 Gy) and limited overall treatment times .
27|D|The radiation scheme used in this study conforms to those guidelines , although the inability to apply intracavitary radiation in 10% of these patients with advanced disease was disappointing .
23|D|The treatment related factors examined were the use of intracavitary radiation , the use of 5-FU , and the fractionation scheme , standard versus partially hyperfractionated .
20|D|The only significant factor predicting for disease-free survival was the use of 5-FU .
24|D|With so few patients , however , there may still be a maldistribution of some unrecognized tumor or patient-related prognostic factor which could be responsible for the differences observed .
25|D|Hyperfractionated radiation and 5-FU should theoretically have offered a benefit over that of standard radiation and 5-FU if increased tumor cell kill results from any interaction between the modalities . 
26|D|Such a benefit was not observed in this study .
21|D|The mechanism by which 5-FU exerts benefit is unknown , but may be simply by additivity due to its independent cytotoxic effect rather than to an interaction with radiation .
2|D|From the subset analysis of this trial we have generated the hypothesis that there may be a beneficial effect of adding concurrent infusional 5-FU to standard in patients with the disease characteristics of stratum 1 .
3|D|Since the data are not conclusive because of limited numbers , confirmation of the beneficial effects observed in this study is necessary .
1|D|The number of patients is too few to recommend that concurrent infusional 5-FU with pelvic irradiation should become the standard therapy for these patients .
42|D|The results of these additional studies will be influential in confirming whether the strategy of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation is beneficial for patients with advanced cervical cancer
