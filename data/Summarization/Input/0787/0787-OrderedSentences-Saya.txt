20|A|Rectal cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases with 11 500 cases diagnosed in the UK in 1994 alone .
2|I|In an attempt to increase the rate of curative resection and hence survival , several trials have investigated the role of preoperative radiotherapy in treatment of rectal cancer .
9|I|The first UK Medical Research Council (MRC) trial of preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer was a three-arm randomised trial with 824 patients comparing a control (surgery alone) group with a group treated with 20 Gy given in 10 equal fractions and another treated with a single exposure of 5 Gy .
10|I|Despite the suggestion of a real biological effect of the radiotherapy in the first MRC trial , with significant changes in tumour stage , no advantage was found for either radiotherapy group over the control group in terms of disease recurrence or survival .
11|I|However , the trial did demonstrate the importance of fixity as a prognostic factor . 80% of mobile tumours had apparently curative resections compared with 50% of partially fixed , and 30% of fixed tumours .
3|I|In 1981 , the MRC began this trial of a higher dose of preoperative radiotherapy in patients with fixed or partially fixed tumours of the rectum who were thought to be suitable for abdominoperineal excision or anterior restorative resection .
23|I|We present the results of this trial with a minimum follow-up time for surviving patients of 5 years .
12|M|Eligible patients were men or women younger than 80 years who , had histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum partially or totally fixed within the pelvis with the lower margin of the tumour within 15 cm of the anal verge , were deemed suitable and fit for the proposed treatment and available for regular follow-up , were free of disseminated disease (confirmed by clinical and radiological examination) , and had had no previous malignant disease .
13|M|Patients then proceeded to immediate surgery or to radiotherapy followed by surgery after a minimum of 4 weeks .
14|M|Disease-free survival time was measured from randomisation to the first event (local or distant recurrence , or death from any cause) .
15|M|Survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method , and compared by the Mantel-Cox version of the log-rank test .
19|M|Pretreatment characteristics of the patients were well balanced (table 1) (A)  .  69 (49%) of 140 patients allocated surgery only had partially fixed tumours and 71 (51%) had fixed tumours .
18|M|Of the 139 patients who had radiotherapy and surgery 69 (50%) had fixed tumours and 70 (50%) had fixed tumours .
17|M|Of patients allocated radiotherapy , 73 (55%) were found to have no residual disease , compared with 66 (48%) of the patients who had surgery alone .
16|R|Of patients allocated surgery alone , 56 (40%) of 140 were thought to have had curative operations compared with 66 (47%) of 139 patients allocated radiotherapy (p=0.21) .
8|D|There was no evidence of an excess of complications in the radiotherapy group . Median follow-up time for the patients who survived is 10 years .
4|R|The effects of radiotherapy on recurrence of cancer and survival are similar to the estimates on which the trial design was based .
1|D|In line with the earlier trials we found no increased frequency of early or late complications in the patients who received radiotherapy .
5|R|There were significant reductions in tumour size and grade and in the rates of local recurrence and distant metastases in the radiotherapy group .
6|D|There was a suggestion that the risk of death from colorectal cancer was reduced , and a trend towards an improvement in overall survival .
7|D|However , the trial was of sufficient size to detect only substantial improvement in overall survival .
21|D|Since the trial was closed , surgeons have been entering patients in large numbers into the AXIS trial in which there is randomisation with respect to preoperative radiation for patients with rectal cancer , with the Swedish model of short , high-dose therapy .
22|D|The combined evidence from all these trials should yield sufficient numbers to answer precisely the questions of the effect of preoperative radiotherapy on local and distant recurrence , and above all the effect on survival .
