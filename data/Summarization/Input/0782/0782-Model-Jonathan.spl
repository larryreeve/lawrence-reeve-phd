Between July , 1981 , and March , 1987 , we enrolled 533 patients with adenocarcinoma of colon or rectum who were about to undergo curative resection and were younger than 75 years .
Patients were randomly assigned no adjuvant treatment (control group) or an immediate postoperative intraportal infusion of 500mg/m fluorouracil plus 5000 units heparin in 1 L 5% glucose per 24 h for 7 consecutive days (days 1-7) plus 10 mg/m mitomycin in a single dose on day 1 .
The group assigned perioperative portal chemotherapy had significantly higher 5-year disease-free survival than the control group (table 2) .
5-year overall survival was also higher in the infusion group (table 2) .
The infusion group had fewer local recurrences and liver metastases with or without relapses at other sites than the control group (table 4) .
1 patient in each group died of myocardial infarction , 2 patients in the control group died of refractory small-bowel obstruction , and 3 patients in each group died of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative septicaemia .
Although chemotherapy was started immediately after surgery , it had no significant effect on rates of wound infection, peritonitis , or breakdown of bowel anastomosis .
Transient leucopenia (<3 X10 white blood cells per L) developed in 6 patients during adjuvant chemotherapy, and the white-blood-cell count was significantly lower on postoperative days 7 and 10 in the infusion group than in the control group .
This trial evaluated the hypothesis that adjuvant portal chemotherapy delivered during surgery and during the early postoperative period would reduce the incidence of liver metastasis and increase survival in patients with colorectal cancer .
After median follow-up of 8 years we were notable to confirm the overall reduction of liver metastases reported by Taylor et al .
We did find, however , a consistent reduction of all kinds of tumour recurrences that resulted in a significant advantage in overall survival and disease-free survival for patients  treated with adjuvant portal infusion , confirming previous findings .
Adjuvant chemotherapy reduced the risk of recurrence by 21 % and the risk of death by 26% .
This effect was observed in all subgroups , but was greatest in patients with tumour-involved lymph nodes (33%) and in those with colon cancer (22%) .
Previous investigations , with the exception of one , have shown improvements in overall and disease-free survival and a reduction in the frequency of liver recurrences , especially in the subgroups of colon cancer patients and of those with tumour-involved regional lymph nodes (Dukes C) .
It seems likely that the effect of adjuvant portal chemotherapy on overall and disease-free survival can be attributed to the systemic effects of intraportal fluorouracil , which lead to a reduction in all tumour relapses (ie , local recurrences , liver metastases , and other distant metastases) .
Our randomised three-arm study (control vs portal vs systemic adjuvant therapy) was carried out between 1987 and 1993 in 770 patients .
Analyses of haematological toxic effects and postoperative complications show more side-effects in the systemic treatment group than in the portal or control groups .
For further studies , we recommend that patients with insulin-dependent diabetes , a high risk of postoperative complications (obesity , cardiac , and/or pulmonary disease) , or any evidence of intra-abdominal sepsis at laparotomy or during the early postoperative period , should be excluded from participation .
The question of whether systemic chemotherapy gives a greater survival advantage than the less toxic intraportal administration remains unresolved .
