The efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for colorectal cancer remains unproven. We have investigated the efficacy of a 
perioperative intraportal cytotoxic regimen in a randomised trial of 533 patients with operable colorectal carcinoma. Patients were 
randomly assigned either a single course of portal infusion with mitomycin (10 mg/m2, one dose) plus fluorouracil 
(500 mg/m2 per 24 h for 7 days) starting immediately after surgery, or no adjuvant treatment. 505 (94%) were evaluable. At median 
follow-up of 8 years, adjuvant therapy reduced the risk of recurrence by 21% 
(hazard ratio 0.79 [95% Cl 0.62-1.00], p=0.051) and the risk of death by 26% 
(0.74 [0.57-0.97], p=0.026). The lower risk of relapse was observed in all subgroups based on node status 
or localisation of the tumour; the risk reduction was greatest in patients with tumour-involved lymph nodes 
(Dukes’ C; 0.67 [0.45-0.99], p=0.045) and for those with colon cancer 
(0.78 [0.56-1.09], p=0.151). Most of the difference in overall and disease-free survival could be 
attributed to a consistent reduction of all kinds of tumour recurrences (local relapses, liver metastases, and other distant metastases) 
in the treated group, rather than to a reduction of liver relapses only. We conclude that part of the benefit obtained with a single 
course of adjuvant chemotherapy via the portal vein for patients with operable colorectal carcinoma might be due to the systemic effects
of the portal chemotherapy.
