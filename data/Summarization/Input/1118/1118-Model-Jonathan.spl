While no therapy has been proven more effective than radical  external-beam plus intracavitary radiotherapy ,  considerable research effort ,   including addition of chemotherapy plus radiation ,  is currently being put into improving survival rate in patients with advanced  carcinoma of the  cervix .
Thus ,  we designed the randomized trial to compare the tumor response  and survival rate of patients with advanced cervical carcinoma receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy versus patients receiving radiotherapy alone .
The purpose of this randomized trial was to assess whether the chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone for locally advanced cervical carcinoma .
This study was designed as a randomized ,  phase III trial conducted at  the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan .
From October 1990 to April 1995 ,  patients with  advanced carcinoma of  the uterine cervix were entered on the study and randomly assigned to  either radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy .
Patients with previously untreated stage IIb bulky or stage IIIb  advanced cervical carcinoma were eligible for study .
Eligible patients were randomized to receive concurrent  chemoradiotherapy or radiation therapy alone .
In the radiation group ,  patients received external beam X-ray treatment followed by intracavitary brachytherapy .
In the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group ,  chemotherapeutic regimens consisted of cisplatin (50 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously at the  rate of 1 mg/min on Day 1) ,  vincristine (1 mg/m2 intravenously push on Day  2) ,  and bleomycin (25 mg/m2 body-surface area intravenously infusion in  divided doses on Days 2 ,  3 ,  and 4) which were given starting on Day 1 of radiotherapy and then every 3 weeks for a total of four courses .
The primary objectives were to compare the two treatment groups with  respect to tumor response ,  failure patterns ,  disease-free interval ,  and  actuarial survival .
The secondary objectives were to compare the two treatment groups with respect to treatment-related toxicities ,  treatment delays ,  and  completeness .
A total of 122 patients with advanced carcinoma of the uterine cervix  were entered and all were eligible for follow-up evaluation .
Among them ,  60 patients were randomized to the concurrent chemotherapy  and radiotherapy ,  62 were  randomized to the radiotherapy alone .
The mean age of the patients was 56.2 years (range ,  33 ­ 68 years) in  the concurrent group ,  and 58.7 years (range ,  41 ­ 69 years) in the  radiotherapy group .
A tumor response was observed in 88.4% (53/60) of the patients in  concurrent group and in 74.2% (46/62) of the patient s in radiotherapy group .
The acute treatment-related toxicity (grade 3 or 4) appears to be  higher with the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group when compared with  radiation group (36.7% versus 17.7% ,  P Å 0.02) .
Although there was no significant difference between the two compared  groups with regard to treatment-related late toxicity  (concurrent group 23.3% versus radiation group 12.9% ,  P = 0.13) , a nonsignificant trend toward a higher rate of late toxicity in the chemoradiotherapy group is evident .
An analysis of the patterns of failure reveals that the incidence of  pelvic failure was equally distributed between the treatment groups (31.7%  versus 30.6% ,  P Å 0.93) .
Additionally ,  there was also no difference in the incidence of distant failure between the  chemoradiotherapy group and the radiotherapy group (21.6% versus 29% ,  P Å 0.47) .
After a median follow-up of 46.8 months ,  the disease-free survival and actuarial survival rates at 3 years for patients in the concurrent chemoradiotherapy group were not statistically different compared with patients in the radiotherapy group (51.7% versus 53.2% ,  P Å 0.92 ,  and  61.7% versus 64.5% ,  P Å 0.88 ,  respectively) .
Analysis by Kaplan ­ Meier method showed that the actuarial survival  was not statistically different between the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups (mean survival time ,  38.1 months versus 41.5 months ,  P Å 0.27) .
Treatment results using  radiation alone in women with locally advanced cervical cancer are unsatisfactory .
These failures may be attributed to large central tumor volumes ,   parametrial extensions of disease resistant to local therapies ,  or metastatic  disease outside the radiation field .
To further increase the systemic activity and the radiation-enhancing potential of the chemotherapy ,  we chose cisplatin-based regimens with vincristine and bleomycin in this trial because it had proven high  efficacy of local control in our previous phase I and II trials for patients  with advanced cervical carcinoma .
Although the response rate of 88.4% ,  following concurrent  chemoradiotherapy ,  in our study is very encouraging when compared with 74.3% of the radiotherapy group at the end of therapy ,  this study does not provide evidence that chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone with  respect to survival .
Our results indicated that ,  despite the excellent early tumor response  seen during treatment ,  the benefit of concurrent chemoradiation in terms of reduced mortality and increased pelvic control rates may not be as  great as that suggested by other reports .
Our study also  revealed that the patterns of recurrences were not  changed by the concomitant therapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
Indeed ,  in our trial ,  the treatment-related toxicity was severe and  resulted in delayed radiotherapy in 15% of patients after chemoradiotherapy ,  in  which 77.8% of patients with treatment delays recurred or died of disease .
Our results demonstrated that multiagent chemoradiotherapy ,   concurrently administrated with radiation to improve tumor response ,  can also  produce serious acute and late  toxicities ,  and life-threatening complications .
In conclusion ,  when comparing patients with concurrent therapy of radiotherapy and chemotherapy to radiotherapy alone ,  our study showed  that concurrent multiagent chemoradiotherapy did not prove to be a superior definitive therapy for patients with advanced cervical carcinoma .
It may be that the multiagent chemotherapy with these drugs ,  dose ,  and schedule used in this study is too toxic to use with concomitant  radiation therapy .
