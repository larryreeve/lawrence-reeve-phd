This study is considered a "second generation" trial for adjuvant chemoetherapy in sarcoma that focused on high risk patients and added ifosfamide (the second most active agent in sarcoma)+ GCSF to doxorubicin .
Patient accrual stopped at half the anticipated number because the planned interim analysis showed significantly improved (72% vs 45%) 2 year disease free survival with chemotherapy .
Now with longer follow up (median 59 months) patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy had improved overall survival ,  but disease free survival was no longer significantly different (50% vs 37%) at 4 years .
There were no treatment related deaths ,  and the toxicity ,  though significant ,  was acceptable .
