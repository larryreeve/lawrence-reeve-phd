16|I|MTX has been widely used as a single agent for treatment of head and neck cancer , while 5-FU is a major drug for treatment of advanced colorectal and gastric cancer .
17|I|The two drugs have been used together clinically on empirical grounds for some time , particularly in the treatment of breast cancer , but data from experimental tumors in vivo and in vitro document both synergistic and antagonistic interactions .
3|I|The sequential exposure of L1210 cells to MTX and then to 5-FU was shown to increase the intracellular concentration of 5-FU ribonucleotides , a potential mechanism of synergy .
4|I|However , synergy is not observed in the presence of physiologic concentrations of purines , raising doubts about its clinical relevance .
2|I|We therefore conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial in which sequential MTX followed by 5-FU was compared to the same drugs given in the opposite order .
6|R|Our results and those of Browman et al do not support reports of superior efficacy for the sequential administration of MTX followed by 5-FU compared to other drug sequences .
7|M|Patients eligible for this study had measurable or evaluable advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck , adenocarcinoma of the colon , rectum or stomach , or SCC of other primary site (Table I) .
8|M|In either case , the dose of MTX was 250 mg/m2 , and the dose of 5-FU was 600 mg/m2 .
10|M|Statistical analysis used BMDP statistical software to prepare and compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves (program BMDPIL) for the group as a whole and for subgroups by primary site , treatment sequence , performance status , sex , age group , and response to therapy .
11|M|Standard WHO definitions of response categories and toxicity grades were followed .
12|M|Differences in response rates between treatment sequences were not statistically significant (Table 3) , but there was a consistent trend toward higher response rates in the groups receiving MF .
5|M|Survival duration was not significantly different by treatment sequence in univariate analyses , though the trend favored the sequence of 5-FU before MTX , in which the median survival had not been reached at 23 months , compared to a median survival of 13.3 months in the group receiving MTX before 5-FU .
14|M|We thought it important to perform this interim analysis of efficacy and toxicity in view of the theoretical possibility that the sequence of 5-FU followed by MTX might prove antagonistic .
13|D|Antagonism could have provided a therapeutic advantage if it were more marked in normal tissues than in tumor , as higher doses could then have been used in the FM arm .
15|D|Such a differential effect was conceivable in view of the widely differing purine concentrations in bone marrow and peripheral blood .
9|R|In fact , no significant difference was observed between the toxicities of the two drug sequences (Table 2) , suggesting that neither synergy nor antagonism was displayed in the effects of either sequence on normal tissues .
1|D|The results do not support reports based on uncontrolled studies that sequential administration of MTX before 5-FU is important to the efficacy of this combination
