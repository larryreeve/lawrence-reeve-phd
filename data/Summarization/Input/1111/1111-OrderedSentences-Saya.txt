31|A|Stage I cervical cancer has a relatively favorable prognosis with an 80% cure rate achieved with radical hysterectomy or radiotherapy .
32|A|However , the 20% mortality after surgery has remained virtually unchanged during the past three decades .
3|A|Certain clinical and pathologic risk factors for Stage 1 cervical cancer recurrence have been identified .
4|A|Pelvic lymph node metastases , for example have been known to decrease the 5-year survival from 82 to 90% in patients with negative nodes to 38 to 61% in patients with positive lymph nodes .
5|A|Additional risk factors for recurrence , e.g. , large tumor diameter (LTD) , deep stromal invasion (DSI) , and presence of tumor in the capillary lymphatic spaces (CLS) found on microscopic examination have been only recently recognized and less extensively investigated than lymph node metastases .
3|I|Traditionally , women with lymph node metastases have been treated with postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy .
6|I|Several authors proposed that patients with certain primary tumorrelated factors such as LTD , DSI , and CLS might also benefit from postoperative radiotherapy .
2|I|In 1988 the GOG initiated a prospective randomized study (GOG #92) , reported here , to investigate the benefits and risks of adjuvant radiotherapy for Stage I cervical cancer patients treated by conventional radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy and who were at high risk for recurrence , because of LTD , DSI , CLS , but excluding patients with lymph node metastases .
7|M|Patients were eligible for the study if they had primary Stage IB squamous , adenosquamous carcinoma , or adenocarcinoma of cervix initially treated with a standard radical hysterectomy and who had negative lymph nodes but one of the previously described combination of risk factors .
8|M|After the eligibility criteria were verified , patients were randomly assigned to one of the two regimens , pelvic radiation or no further therapy .
12|M|Patients received external beam irradiation and no brachytherapy .
13|M|All histology slides were reviewed by two pathologists of the GOG Pathology 
14|M|Committee who measured the depth of stromal invasion expressed in thirds of cervical thickness and ascertained the presence or absence of the capillary lymphatic space tumor involvement and the tumor cell type . 
29|M|Any disagreement among the reviewing pathologists was resolved by a GOG referee pathologist .
15|M|The primary outcome variable was recurrence-free interval (RFI) .
17|R|Thirty-nine (27.9%) of the 140 women in the NFT group developed cancer recurrence , 27 (19.3%) local (vagina or pelvis) , and 10 (7.1%) distant .
18|R|By contrast , there were only 21 (15.3%) cancer recurrences , 18 (13.1%) local and 3 (2.2%) distant among the 137 patients treated with postoperative radiation .
16|R|The Cox model analysis indicated that when adjusting for all combinations of the three risk factors-tumor size , CLS , and the depth of invasion-the risk of recurrence was significantly reduced by 44% in the radiation group (P 5 0.019 , one-tail) .
9|R|Both large tumor diameter and deep stromal invasion are indices of large tumor volume , conceivably affecting cancer progression and its metastatic spread .
10|D|Of the three risk factors , depth of invasion seems the most objective and accurate method-a direct measurement on the histological slide .
11|D|Nevertheless , we found tumor diameter to be the most significant risk factors in the Cox model analysis of our study results , confirming multiple data sets which demonstrate that the size of the primary cancer is critical for local control despite the imprecision of measurement .
19|D|The use of adjuvant radiotherapy to improve the outcome in the Stage I cervical cancer patients with large tumor diameter , deep invasion , and CLS has been previously proposed .
20|D|One report showed that postoperative radiation "prevented local recurrences and improved ten year tumor-free-survival" in a small number of women with CLS , DSI , and microscopically involved lymph nodes .
21|D|More recently , Thomas and Dembo postulated that women with negative nodes but primary tumor-related poor prognostic factors were more likely to recur in the pelvis than in distant sites and , therefore , may benefit from pelvic irradiation .
22|D|By contrast , in women with positive nodes local failure is more frequently associated with metastases in distant sites that are not affected by pelvic irradiation .
23|D|Interestingly , our prospective study did provide conclusive evidence of pelvic radiotherapy being effective in women with primary tumor-related risk factors but negative nodes . 
24|D|However , no such evidence from randomized trials is available about effective treatment of positive lymph nodes . 
25|D|The GOG attempted to conduct a randomized radiotherapy trial for women with positive nodes , but could not complete the study because of failure to enroll a sufficient number of patients (unpublished GOG data) . 
26|D|Our present study confirms both predicted and reported benefits from postoperative radiation .
27|R|It should be noted that the 27% recurrence rate at 3 years in our study population is lower than the anticipated one-third .
28|D|Since the node-negative group accounts for one-half of all Stage IB cervical cancer deaths adjuvant radiotherapy for women with risk factors should substantially reduce the overall Stage IB mortality .
1|D|Thus , adjunctive radiotherapy is beneficial for Stage I cervical cancer patients with clinical-pathological risk factors for recurrence other than positive nodes .
