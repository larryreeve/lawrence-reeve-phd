Background and Methods : On behalf of the Gynecologic Oncology Group , we performed a randomized trial of radiotherapy in combination with three concurrent chemotherapy regimens — cisplatin alone ; cisplatin , fluorouracil , and hydroxyurea ; and hydroxyurea alone — in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer .
Women with primary untreated invasive squamous-cell carcinoma , adenosquamous carcinoma , or adenocarcinoma of the cervix of stage IIB , III , or IVA , without involvement of the para-aortic lymph nodes , were enrolled . 
The patients had to have a leukocyte count of at least 3000 per cubic millimeter , a platelet count of at least 100,000 per cubic millimeter , a serum creatinine level no higher than 2 mg per deciliter (177 µmol per liter) , and adequate hepatic function .
All patients received external-beam radiotherapy according to a strict protocol . 
Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of three chemotherapy regimens : 40 mg of cisplatin per square meter of body-surface area per week for six weeks (group 1) ; 50 mg of cisplatin per square meter on days 1 and 29 , followed by 4 g of fluorouracil per square meter given as a 96-hour infusion on days 1 and 29 , and 2 g of oral hydroxyurea per square meter twice weekly for six weeks (group 2); or 3 g of oral hydroxyurea per square meter twice weekly for six weeks (group 3) .
Results: The analysis included 526 women . 
The median duration of follow-up was 35 months . 
Both groups that received cisplatin had a higher rate of progression-free survival than the group that received hydroxyurea alone (P<0.001 for both comparisons) . 
The relative risks of progression of disease or death were 0.57 (95 percent confidence interval , 0.42 to 0.78) in group 1 and 0.55 (95 percent confidence interval , 0.40 to 0.75) in group 2 , as compared with group 3 . 
The overall survival rate was significantly higher in groups 1 and 2 than in group 3 , with relative risks of death of 0.61 (95 percent confidence interval , 0.44 to 0.85) and 0.58 (95 percent confidence interval , 0.41 to 0.81) , respectively . 
Conclusions: Regimens of radiotherapy and chemotherapy that contain cisplatin improve the rates of survival and progression-free survival among women with locally advanced cervical cancer .
