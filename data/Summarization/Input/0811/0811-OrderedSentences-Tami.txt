31|I|The purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate , by such a randomized and controlled comparison , a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5-FU activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials .
32|I|We chose for our evaluation the combinations of 5- FU with thymidine , with N-(phosphonacetyl)-Laspartic acid (PALA) , with levamisole , and with methyl CCNU , vincristine , and streptozotocin (MOF-Strept) .
30|I|Thymidine given at high doses in animal model systems has been shown to increase both therapeutic activity and toxicity of 5-FU and to improve the therapeutic index of this agent .
29|I|PALA is a potent inhibitor of aspartate transcarbamylase and has a broad spectrum of activity in animal model tumor screens .
28|I|Levamisole is an agent that has been used extensively to treat parasitic infections in man and domestic animals .
27|I|It has also been shown to have immunomodulatory effects .
26|I|In 1981 , a New York Memorial study reported a 32% objective response rate among 77 patients treated with MOF-Strept .
2|I|With this background we initiated a randomized controlled comparison of 5-FU alone with 5-FU plus high-dose thymidine , 5-FU plus PALA , 5-FU plus levamisole , and MOF-Strept .
3|I|We elected to use survival as our primary endpoint in patients with both measurable and nonmeasurable disease and also to evaluate objective response rates among those patients with measurable disease .
5|M|All patients were required to have histologic or cytologic confirmation of unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer .
4|M|Patients were then randomized to treatment with 5-FU alone , 5-FU plus PALA. 5-FU plus thymidine. 5-FU plus levamisole , or MOFStrept .
23|M|The primary endpoint of our overall study was patient survival .
24|M|A secondary objective was to assess objective response rates among those patients who had measurable disease .
25|M|Standard criteria for declaring objective response were used. ie. a 5017 or greater reduction in the product of longest perpendicular diameters of bidimensionally measurable lesions or a 30% or greater decrease in the sum of liver measurements below the xyphoid process at costal margin .
6|R|A total of 347 patients were randomized on this study .
7|R|It is noteworthy that most of these patients were in excellent general condition .
14|R|MOF-Strept was characterized by substantially more frequent and more severe nausea and vomiting , and this was the only regimen characterized by a substantive incidence of thrombocytopenia .
15|R|5-FU plus PALA had substantially more frequent mucocutaneous reactions and somewhat more frequent diarrhea , but less hematologic toxicity than 5-FU alone or any of the other regimens .
16|R|On the other hand , 5-FU plus thymidine had a reduced incidence of mucocutaneous reactions and of diarrhea with comparable hematologic toxicity when compared with 5-FU alone .
17|R|The addition of levamisole to 5-FU had no discernable impact upon toxicity except for a slight increase in leukopenia .
21|R|There were three treatment-related deaths , one each on 5-FU alone , 5-FU plus thymidine , and MOF-Strept .
8|R|None of the combination regimens showed a significant advantage to 5-FU used alone .
9|R|It is noteworthy that while the MOF-Strept regimen had the highest regression rate , it was also the regimen with the lowest proportion of patients whose disease remained stable and the highest proportion of patients in whom the best response observed was tumor regression .
10|R|Whereas 5-FU plus PALA was associated with the lowest regression rate , these regressions were of the longest median duration .
12|R|The median interval to progression for all patients was 3/V2 months .
11|R|There was no suggestion that any of the combination regimens performed in a superior fashion to 5-FU used alone , and it is unlikely that any could produce as much as a 50% increase in time to progression (P < .05) for each regimen v 5-FU alone .
13|R|The median survival for all patients was 81/4 months .
22|R|None of the combination regimens showed a significant superiority to 5-FU used alone .
1|D|In spite of the fact that the patients tested were in very good overall general condition with no previous chemotherapy exposure , none of our experimental regimens produced any meaningful advantage over therapy with simple 5-FU alone and none can be recommended for standard practice .
18|D|In each of the regimens we tested , drug dosages and scheduling were admittedly largely arbitrary .
19|D|It is entirely possible that different proportionate representation of drug dosages or different scheduling could produce more favorable or less favorable results than we observed .
20|D|An interesting sidelight of this study is the fact that grade of tumor anaplasia was found to be a powerful prognostic determinant , matching the more well-established performance status and presence or absence of measurable disease .
