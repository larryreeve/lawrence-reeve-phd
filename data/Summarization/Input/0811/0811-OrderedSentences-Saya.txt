26|A|ADVANCED colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common oncologic challenges encountered in the Western world .
27|I|Nevertheless , there is little evidence of effective therapy for such patients other than symptomatic and supportive care .
25|I|5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is considered by many as the standard of chemotherapy , but in larger experiences with this agent , response rates have only been in the 15% to 20% range .
28|I|These responses are usually partial , sometimes questionable , and generally very transient .
8|I|Although a large number of alternative drugs have been studied in colorectal cancer , none has exceeded the meager effectiveness of 5-FU .
4|I|A hope frequently pursued in clinical research has been that the activity of 5-FU can be enhanced either by adding the activity of other cytotoxic drugs or , more recently , by favorably modulating the effects of 5-FU itself .
2|I|The purpose of the study reported here is to evaluate , by such a randomized and controlled comparison , a number of recent approaches that have either been shown in animal models to enhance 5-FU activity or have been claimed to produce favorable results on the basis of early human trials .
3|M|We chose for our evaluation the combinations of 5- FU with thymidine , with N-(phosphonacetyl)-Laspartic acid (PALA) , with levamisole , and with methyl CCNU , vincristine , and streptozotocin (MOF-Strept) .
18|M|All patients were required to have histologic or cytologic confirmation of unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer .
19|M|An exception to the requirement for histologic confirmation of metastasis was made in the patient with a previous histologically confirmed primary colorectal carcinoma and who presented with multiple pulmonary metastasis that had shown progression on two chest x-rays taken at least 1 month apart .
20|M|Patients could be entered with either measurable or nonmeasurable disease .
17|M|Measurable disease was defined as a tumor mass that could be clearly measured in two dimensions on either physical examination or chest x-ray .
21|M|Tissue from each patient was submitted to a pathology review committee to ensure eligibility and proper histopathologic classification .
22|M|After determining eligibility and obtaining written informed consent , patients were stratified according to performance score and the presence and location of measurable disease .
9|M|Patients were then randomized to treatment with 5-FU alone , 5-FU plus PALA , 5-FU plus thymidine , 5-FU plus levamisole , or MOFStrept .
16|M|If severe toxicity had been obtained with a previous treatment course , drug dosages were appropriately reduced with subsequent therapy . The primary endpoint of our overall study was patient survival .
10|M|Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method .
11|M|There are imbalances between treatment arms in sex ratio , grade of anaplasia , and patients admitted to study with progressive pulmonary lesions but no histologic proof of metastasis .
12|D|It is noteworthy that while the MOF-Strept regimen had the highest regression rate , it was also the regimen with the lowest proportion of patients whose disease remained stable and the highest proportion of patients in whom the best response observed was tumor regression .
13|R|Whereas 5-FU plus PALA was associated with the lowest regression rate , these regressions were of the longest median duration .
15|D|Grade of anaplasia also proved to be a powerful prognostic predictor .
14|R|The median survival for all patients was 81/4 months .
29|R|The results of this study were singularly discouraging .
1|D|In spite of the fact that the patients tested were in very good overall general condition with no previous chemotherapy exposure , none of our experimental regimens produced any meaningful advantage over therapy with simple 5-FU alone and none can be recommended for standard practice .
23|D|In each of the regimens we tested , drug dosages and scheduling were admittedly largely arbitrary .
5|D|The dose-limiting mucocutaneous toxicity that we observed undoubtedly represented the additive effects of both agents .
30|D|Our results were disappointing .
6|D|Martin has pointed out that it might be possible to obtain the full biochemical modulating effect of PALA by using a considerably lower dose of this agent , thereby allowing the 5-FU dose to be increased to near full therapeutic levels .
7|D|Further exploration of the 5-FU-PALA theme might be justified on this basis .
24|D|Whereas the results of this study were negative , these should not discourage continued efforts to exploit the biochemical modulation approaches .
31|D|We would hope this could be done more successfully with increasing knowledge of how best to apply the results of experimental models in the clinical settings .
