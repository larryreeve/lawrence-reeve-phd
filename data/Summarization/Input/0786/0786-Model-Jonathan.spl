In 1985 , the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG , study GI 7175) reported that postoperative radiation and chemotherapy reduced the tumor recurrence rate for patients who had undergone a curative resection for rectal adenocarcinoma .
Although the superiority of combination radiotherapy and chemotherapy with fluorouracil(5-FU) and semustine (MeCCNU) was clearly shown in terms of both disease-free survival and , subsequently , overall survival , the clinical impact of such treatment was tempered by the inclusion of MeCCNU in an adjuvant setting .
A two-arm study was designed using the initial radiation/chemotherapy program of the previous study (GI 7175) for both arms of the new study (GI 7180) but to offering MeCCNU to only half the patients during the postradiation period .
The same postradiation regimen of 5-FU and MeCCNU as that used in GI 7175 was chosen for one arm , with the exception that the duration of treatment with postradiation 5-FU and MeCCNU was reduced from 18 months to 12 months in an attempt to reduce the leukemogenic potential of the MeCCNU .
An escalating single-agent 5-FU regimen incorporating a theoretical maximum-tolerated dose was chosen as the alternative treatment option based on clinical evidence suggesting a dose response curve for 5-FU and pilot data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggesting added efficacy of 5-FU when given at higher dose levels .
Patients were considered eligible for entry onto the study provided they had histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum and had undergone a surgical procedure at which time all gross tumor had been removed and no evidence of tumor had been present at the resection margins .
Between March 1981 and November 1985 , 210 patients were enrolled in this study , 101 were randomized to the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen , and 109 to the escalating 5-FU arm .
Of the 199 patients who comprised the cohort for primary analysis , 95 were randomized to receive postradiation 5-FU and MeCCNU , and 104 were randomized to receive postradiation escalating 5-FU .
The clinical characteristics were well balanced between the treatment arms , with a slightly higher percentage of patients having disease extension into perirectal fat randomized to receive 5-FU and MeCCNU (61%) compared with escalating 5-FU (56%) , and a higher percentage of males randomized to escalating 5-FU compared with 5-FU and MeCCNU (63% v 56% , respectively) .
The median follow-up time for the 108 surviving patients is 5.8 years with 3 years of follow-up available for all but five surviving patients .
Two treatment-related deaths were reported , one on each treatment arm .
Disease recurrence has been documented in 48% of eligible patients including 54% (51 of 95) of patient srandomized to receive 5-FU and MeCCNU and 43% (45 of 104) of patients randomized to receive escalating 5-FU (Table 3) .
Recurrences involving local sites occurred in 17% of 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 16% of escalating 5-FU patients .
Significantly (P = .05) more recurrences involving distant sites have been documented on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm (40%) compared with the escalating 5-FU arm (26%) .
The probability of 3-year disease-free survival on the two arms is 54% and 68% for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and the escalating 5-FU arm , respectively , median time to recurrenceis estimated to be 4 years and greater than 4 years , respectively (Fig 1) .
The difference in disease-free survival favors the escalating 5-FU arm , but this difference is not statistically significant (P = .20 , two-tailed) .
After adjustment for these variables , the 5-FU and MeCCNU and the escalating 5-FU treatment results remained statistically indistinguishable (P = .30 , two-tailed) .
In fact , the adjusted relative risk (RR) for tumor recurrence associated with the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm is 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] , .84 to 1.66) , when considered individually without adjustment for covariates , it is estimated to be 1.30 (95% CI , .87 to 1.94) .
A total of 91 deaths have been reported , 46% (44 of 95) on 5-FU and MeCCNU and 45% (47 of 104) on 5-FU .
Eighty-one of the deaths were attributed to progressive disease , and one death was reported without documented cause , the causes of death for the remaining nine patients were attributed to treatment (two patients , discussed above) , myocardial infarctions (five , three of whom had a suspected recurrence) , stroke (one) , and metastatic disease resulting from a new primary tumor arising in the bile duct (one) .
Six of the deaths unrelated to disease occurred in patients receiving escalating 5-FU and three in patients receiving 5-FU and MeCCNU .
There is no difference between the two arms with respect to the survival distributions (P = .58 , two-tailed) .
Patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to the margin greater than 3 cm experienced improved survival compared with patients undergoing anterior resection with distance to the nearest margin <= 3 cm , suggesting that abdominal-perineal resection should be considered when the distal margin for resection with the low anterior route would be <= 3 cm .
As in the disease-free analysis , secondary analyses of survival considering either all patients randomized or only patients who received treatment after the completion of radiation therapy , resulted in no meaningful change in direction or magnitude of the RR attributed to treatment with the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen (RR = 1.10 , 95% CI , .72 to 1.67 , and RR = 1.04 , 95% CI , .65 to 1.67 , respectively) .
A stage-wise comparison of the results of this study with GI 7175 in which the same staging criteria of GI 7175 were applied to GI 7180 shows that reducing the chemotherapeutic regimen of 5-FU and MeCCNU from 18 months to 12 months did not significantly alter the survival outcome for patients .
The results of this study indicate that treatment after surgical  resection of Dukes B2 and C rectal cancer with escalating 5-FU postradiation therapy provides similar survival and recurrence outcomes as a postradiation chemotherapeutic regimen including the leukemogen MeCCNU .
Both survival and disease-free survival results favor the escalating 5-FU arm , although these differences did not reach statistical significance .
Fewer recurrences involving distant sites occurred on the escalating 5-FU arm compared with the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm, further suggesting that MeCCNU is not an essential component of the postradiation chemotherapy treatment .
Although similar rates of local recurrence were experienced on the two study arms , the similarity in outcome is not surprising as both arms used identical postsurgery radiation therapy regimens including 5-FU .
As expected , myelosuppression was the most common toxicity seen in both arms .
To date , no patient treated with 5-FU and MeCCNU in this study has developed leukemia .
Results from the previous GITSG study (GI 7175) of adjuvant therapy after surgical resection of Dukes B2 or C rectal cancer demonstrated improved survival and disease-free survival in patients treated with combination radiation therapy and post radiation therapy using 5-FU and MeCCNU when compared with surgery alone, and improved disease-free survival for patients treated with this combined modality therapy compared with radiation therapy alone .
The results of the present study confirm the expected survival and disease-free survival probabilities observed in the combination therapy arm of the previous GITSG study , while the recent report by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) further demonstrates the advantage of combination radiation therapy and chemotherapy compared with radiation therapy alone in reducing recurrence rates and improving survival .
A recent National Institutes of Health consensus conference on adjuvant therapy for patients with colon and rectal cancer concluded that combined postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy improved local control and survival in stage B2 and C patients with rectal cancer and that treatment with combined modality therapy in these patients is recommended .
The results of this study show that comparable results can be achieved using a combination regimen that does not include MeCCNU , this conclusion is also supported by preliminary data reported by the NCCTG .
The increased leukemicpotential of MeCCNU makes the drug additionally undesirable to include in the adjuvant setting .
Therefore , we conclude that MeCCNU is not an essential component of effective postoperative combined modality treatment of adjuvant rectal cancer and should not be included in future treatment regimens .
