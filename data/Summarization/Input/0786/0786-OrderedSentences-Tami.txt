26|I|A two-arm study was designed using the initial radiation/chemotherapy program of the previous study (GI 7175) for both arms of the new study (GI 7180) but to offering MeCCNU to only half the patients during the postradiation period .
27|I|The same postradiation regimen of 5-FU and MeCCNU as that used in GI 7175 was chosen for one arm , with the exception that the duration of treatment with postradiation 5-FU and MeCCNU was reduced from 18 months to 12 months in an attempt to reduce the leukemogenic potential of the MeCCNU .
28|I|An escalating single-agent 5-FU regimen incorporating a theoretical maximum-tolerated dose was chosen as the alternative treatment option based on clinical evidence suggesting a dose response curve for 5-FU and pilot data from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute suggesting added efficacy of 5-FU when given at higher dose levels .
24|M|Patients were considered eligible for entry onto the study provided they had histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum and had undergone a surgical procedure at which time all gross tumor had been removed and no evidence of tumor had been present at the resection margins .
25|M|Only patients with Dukes pathologic stage B2 (negative nodes , disease extension into the perirectal fat) , C1 (positive nodes , no disease extension into the perirectal fat) , and C2 , (positive nodes , disease extension into the perirectal fat) were eligible , and slides must have been available for review .
36|M|Normal hepatic , renal , and bone marrow function (ie , bilirubin level < 2.5 mg/dL , BUN level< 25 mg/dL , or creatinine level < 1.5 mg/dL , leukocyte and platelet counts > 4,500/uL and 125,000/uL , respectively) must have been documented before study entry .
29|M|The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an adjuvant treatment with radiation therapy and escalating 5-FU and to compare it with a combination of 5-FU and MeCCNU .
30|M|A major goal was to assess the contribution of MeCCNU to adjuvant benefit .
31|M|The original design called for the enrollment of 134 patients per arm , and the primary end point was to detect a difference in the 30-month disease-free survival rate from .65 for the MeCCNU-containing arm to .80 for the escalating 5-FU arm .
32|M|Despite early termination of accrual due to loss of funding , the results of this study provide important information regarding the potential effectiveness of the escalating 5-FU regimen compared with a MeCCNU-containing regimen .
34|R|Between March 1981 and November 1985 , 210 patients were enrolled in this study , 101 were randomized to the 5-FU and MeCCNU regimen , and 109 to the escalating 5-FU arm .
35|R|Eleven patients (six receiving 5-FUand MeCCNU and five receiving escalating 5-FU) , comprising 5% of the registered population , are not included in the primary analysis as they were determined to be ineligible by an independent review .
8|R|Of the 199 patients who comprised the cohort for primary analysis , 95 were randomized to receive postradiation 5-FU and MeCCNU , and 104 were randomized to receive postradiation escalating 5-FU .
33|R|The median follow-up time for the 108 surviving patients is 5.8 years with 3 years of follow-up available for all but five surviving patients .
16|R|Toxicities experienced by patients on the two arms are comparable , 53% of patients on the 5-FU and MeCCNUarm (52 of 99) and 50% of those assigned to the escalating 5-FU arm (54 of 107) experienced at least one episode of severe or worse toxicity as defined by the GITSG toxicity scale .
17|R|Life-threatening toxicities were reported in six (6%) 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 11 (10%) escalating 5-FU patients .
18|R|Leukocyte depression below 1 ,000/UL accounted for a majority of these episodes (eight patients on the escalating 5-FU arm and three on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm) .
19|R|Two treatment-related deaths were reported , one on each treatment arm .
11|R|Disease recurrence has been documented in 48% of eligible patients including 54% (51 of 95) of patient srandomized to receive 5-FU and MeCCNU and 43% (45 of 104) of patients randomized to receive escalating 5-FU (Table 3) .
12|R|Recurrences involving local sites occurred in 17% of 5-FU and MeCCNU patients and 16% of escalating 5-FU patients .
13|R|Significantly (P = .05) more recurrences involving distant sites have been documented on the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm (40%) compared with the escalating 5-FU arm (26%) .
14|R|The probability of 3-year disease-free survival on the two arms is 54% and 68% for patients assigned to the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm and the escalating 5-FU arm , respectively , median time to recurrenceis estimated to be 4 years and greater than 4 years , respectively (Fig 1) .
15|R|The difference in disease-free survival favors the escalating 5-FU arm , but this difference is not statistically significant (P = .20 , two-tailed) .
9|R|A total of 91 deaths have been reported , 46% (44 of 95) on 5-FU and MeCCNU and 45% (47 of 104) on 5-FU .
10|R|Kaplan-Meier estimates of 3-year survival probabilities for patients assigned to 5-FU and MeCCNU and escalating 5-FU are 66% and 75% , respectively (Fig 2) .
1|D|The results of this study indicate that treatment after surgical resection of Dukes B2 and C rectal cancer with escalating 5-FU postradiation therapy provides similar survival and recurrence outcomes as a postradiation chemotherapeutic regimen including the leukemogen MeCCNU .
2|D|Both survival and disease-free survival results favor the escalating 5-FU arm , although these differences did not reach statistical significance .
3|D|Fewer recurrences involving distant sites occurred on the escalating 5-FU arm compared with the 5-FU and MeCCNU arm , further suggesting that MeCCNU is not an essential component of the postradiation chemotherapy treatment .
4|D|Although similar rates of local recurrence were experienced on the two study arms , the similarity in outcome is not surprising as both arms used identical postsurgery radiation therapy regimens including 5-FU .
21|D|As expected , myelosuppression was the most common toxicity seen in both arms .
22|D|Although there were twice as many intestinal obstructions among patients receiving escalating 5-FU , no association with type of chemotherapy can be drawn from these small samples .
23|D|To date , no patient treated with 5-FU and MeCCNU in this study has developed leukemia .
37|D|The results of the present study confirm the expected survival and disease-free survival probabilities observed in the combination therapy arm of the previous GITSG study , while the recent report by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) further demonstrates the advantage of combination radiation therapy and chemotherapy compared with radiation therapy alone in reducing recurrence rates and improving survival .
5|D|The results of this study show that comparable results can be achieved using a combination regimen that does not include MeCCNU , this conclusion is also supported by preliminary data reported by the NCCTG .
6|D|The increased leukemicpotential of MeCCNU makes the drug additionally undesirable to include in the adjuvant setting .
7|D|Therefore , we conclude that MeCCNU is not an essential component of effective postoperative combined modality treatment of adjuvant rectal cancer and should not be included in future treatment regimens .
