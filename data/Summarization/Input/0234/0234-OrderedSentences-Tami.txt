27|I|DOXORUBICIN (DOX) , or Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories , Columbus , Ohio) , is one of the most useful antineoplastic agents available .
28|I|It possesses a broad spectrum of clinical antitumor efficacy and is the most active nonhormonal drug for the treatment of breast cancer .
29|I|Its use , however , is limited by cumulative , dose-dependent , chronic cardiotoxicity .
30|I|In retrospective studies , the incidence of symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) was estimated to be approximately 3% to 4% after a cumulative DOX dose of 450 mg/m2 and 6% to 10% after 550 mg/m2 , the incidence of CHF rises steeply after higher cumulative doses.On the basis of these retrospective studies , an empiric dose limitation of 450 to 550 mg/m2 has been recommended when DOX is used on a standard every three week schedule .
39|I|Epirubicin (4'-epi-doxorubicin , EPI) is one such compound .
31|I|It is a stereoisomer of DOX in which the hydroxyl group at the 4' position of the aminosugar side chain is epimerized (Fig 1) .
32|I|The antitumor activity of EPI in animal models is similar to that of DOX , but EPI is a less toxic compound with regard to both cytotoxicity and cardiac injury .
33|I|In two clinical phase I studies , EPI was found to have acceptable toxicity at doses of 85 to 90 mg/m2 given intravenously (IV) every three weeks .
34|I|The acute toxicity was qualitatively similar to that seen with DOX .
35|I|Therapeutic responses were observed in patients with advanced breast cancer in both studies .
22|M|This study was conducted in patients with advanced breast cancer who had progressed after receiving combination chemotherapy .
23|M|Patients were stratified for performance status (Karnofsky scale < 70% v > 80%) and for estrogen receptor status of the primary or a metastatic lesion (positive or unknown v negative) .
24|M|All patients were then randomly assigned to receive either EPI or DOX .
25|M|The dose of EPI was 85 mg/m2 , and the dose of DOX was 60 mg/m2 .
26|M|It was anticipated that these doses would produce equivalent degrees of myelosuppression .
21|M|Therefore , for this study laboratory cardiac toxicity was defined as decrease in resting LVEF of > 10% from pretreatment baseline or a decrease in LVEF with stress of > 5% from the resting baseline obtained on the same day .
20|R|A total of 54 women were randomized , 25 to the EPI arm and 29 to the DOX arm .
14|R|The median actual dose administered was 100% of the projected dose of EPI and 86% of the planned dose of DOX (Wilcoxon test , P = .01) .
11|R| Six (25%) of the 24 evaluable patients treated with EPI and seven (25%) of the 28 evaluable patients on the DOX arm achieved PRs .
12|R|The median duration of PR for patients responding to EPI was 11.9 months , whereas median duration of PR on the DOX arm was 7.1 months .
13|R|Although the major response rates did not differ between the two arms (chisquare test , P = .98) , the difference in duration of response is of borderline significance (logrank test , P = .11) .
36|R|Cardiac toxicity alone did not limit the administration of EPI , but DOX was discontinued in three patients with ongoing PRs because of cardiac toxicity .
15|R|Hematologic toxicity was similar in the two arms (Table 3) .
19|R| The median WBC nadir was 2.0 x 103/gL (range , 0.1 to 8.6) and the median platelet nadir was 132 x 103//pL (range , 20.0 to 279.0) in patients receiving EPI , the median WBC nadir was 1.8 x 10'/3tL (range , 0.3 to .9) and median platelet nadir was 130 x 103/pL (range 24.0 to 253.0) in patients on the DOX arm .
16|R| Each patient had a baseline RNCA scan , and in all patients the resting LVEF was > 50% with the exception of one patient in whom it was 48% .
17|R|The median dose to development of cardiotoxicity for all evaluable patients was 935 mg/m2 for EPI and 468 mg/m2 for DOX (Fig 2A) .
37|R|The difference remains statistically significant with a P value of .04 .
18|R| The cumulative doses of EPI at which clinical CHF was observed (1,035 , 1,105 , 1,162 , and 1,234 mg/m 2) were approximately twice the cumulative doses of DOX at which CHF was seen (456 , 480 , 492 , 560 , and 600 mg/m2) .
1|D|In this study , EPI had therapeutic activity in breast cancer similar to DOX , but produced less cardiotoxicity than the parent compound .
8|D|A combination of RNCA and endomyocardial biopsy is recommended for the individual patient at high risk for whom a therapeutic decision must be made .
38|D|Although endomyocardial biopsy is probably the definitive measure of cardiac injury , RNCA has the advantage of being noninvasive and , therefore , acceptable to virtually all patients in a randomized study of antineoplastic agents .
2|D|In the present trial , EPI was compared with its parent compound in terms of both toxicity and antitumor efficacy .
3|D|The observed major therapeutic response rate to EPI (25%) was identical to that observed with DOX (25%) .
4|D|In the present study , each drug was given every three weeks in doses that produced equivalent degrees of myelosuppression , a preplanned limitation on the total cumulative dose of EPI was not used .
5|D|In the present study , EPI was found to be significantly less cardiotoxic than DOX , even when the dose is normalized to full myelosuppressive equivalence .
6|D|In contrast , the present study predicts an incidence of laboratory cardiotoxicity in excess of 70% for those patients who receive more than 600 mg/m2 of DOX .
9|D|Thus , while assessment of LVEF by RNCA was useful in quantitating changes in cardiacfunction for the purposes of this study , it cannot be recommended for routine monitoring of individual patients as a predictor of impending cardiac failure .
7|D|Our results show that EPI has therapeutic activity that is similar to that of DOX in patients with advanced breast cancer , and that EPI is a less cardiotoxic drug than DOX , even accounting for the difference in myelosuppressive potency .
10|D|These findings , which are supported by the independent work of several other investigators , provide encouragement for further clinical trials with EPI .
39|D|Just as schedule modification has reduced the cardiotoxic effects of DOX , 22 exploration of a weekly schedule of EPI administration is warranted .
