Response rates (25% vs. 25% PRs) and duration of response (11.9 vs. 7.1 months) were not  different between the EPI and DOX treatment arms.  Hematologic toxicity, nausea, vomiting and alopecia were not significantly different between the 2 groups.  Results suggested reduced cardiotoxicity with epirubicin.  Premature discontinuation of DOX  was required in 3 patients experiencing PRs, whereas effective treatment with EPI was never discontinued because of cardiac toxicity.  However, clinical evidence of CHF occurred in 4/25 patients in the EPI arm and 5/29 patients in the DOX arm while laboratory evidence of cardiotoxicity was present in 8 patients in the EPI arm and 9 patients in the DOX arm.
