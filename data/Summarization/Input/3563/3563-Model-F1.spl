Well designed yet underpowered study evaluating single layer running and double layer anastomoses for complication rate , time , cost of materials , and length of stay . 
Time to complete the anastamosis was shorter by 10 minutes for the single layer group (p < 0.001) , there were 2 leaks in the 2 layer group , 1 leak in the one layer group , and  2 abscesses in each group (p=ns) .
Length of stay was 2 days shorter in the one layer group (p=0.08) .
Cost for materials was less in the one layer group .
Statistics performed based on number of anastomoses , not patients .
Gastro-jejunostomies and low rectal anastamoses were excluded , as were any patients in whom the surgeon felt both techniques were not equivalent for technical reasons .
Interestingly , this study was done without informed consent as the IRB felt both techniques were in use already and had established efficacy .
