Of these ,  the method that has proven successful in most  situations and in the hands of most surgeons has been the two-layer anastomosis using interrupted silk sutures for an outer inverted seromuscular layer  and a running absorbable suture for a transmural inner layer .
Recently ,  several reports have appeared advocating a single-layer continuousanastomosis using monofilament plastic suture .
Because of these potential advantages ,  we hypothesized that the single-layer technique could be introduced into our surgical teaching program  with no increase in anastomotic failure and that it could be performed in  less time than the two-layer technique .
Patients were assigned to either the one-or two-layer technique  in a prospective ,  randomized fashion .
All two-layer anastomoses were constructed using interrupted 3.0  silk Lembert sutures for the outer layer and a running 3.0  polyglycolic acidsuture for the transmural inner layer .
All single-layer anastomoses were constructed using a continuous  3.0 polypropylene double-needle suture that began at the mesenteric  border (Fig. 1) .
Anastomotic failure was defined as a fistula documented radiographically or by the finding of a nonabsorbable material (charcoal) draining  from the wound after oral administration ,  or a visible disruption of the  suture line during reexploration .
One hundred twenty-five patients were enrolled in the study .
Fifty-nine patients were randomized to single-layer anastomoses and 66 to two-layer anastomoses .
The present study demonstrates that a single-layer continuous anastomosis is similar in terms of safety to the two-layer technique ,  but that it  can be constructed in a significantly shorter time and at a lower cost .
The mean time saved by creating the single-layer anastomosis ,  10 minutes , may seem relatively insignificant .
However ,  our study design did not include the time required to prepare the bowel for anastomosis ,  which is considerably less for the one-layer technique .
With the single-layer method ,  less circumferential clearing is required ,  and in many instances no clearance is necessary .
In contrast ,  it is difficult for an experienced surgeon to  create a two-layer anastomosis in less than 20 to 25 minutes .
It was surprising to see the considerable difference in cost of materialsfor the anastomoses .
Most of the difference is accounted for by the cost of the silk  suture packets ,  at $9.41 each .
The major weakness of the study is its relatively small sample size .
It is therefore difficult to make definitive statements  regarding the relative risk of uncommon outcomes ,  such as anastomotic  leakage .
To detect a significant difference in leakage rates based on our data ,  a power analysis indicated that 1,500 patients would be required .
However ,  our results and those in the literature are consistent  and reassuring .
