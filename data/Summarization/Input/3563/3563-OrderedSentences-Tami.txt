17|I|Of these , the method that has proven successful in most situations and in the hands of most surgeons has been the two-layer anastomosis using interrupted silk sutures for an outer inverted seromuscular layer  and a running absorbable suture for a transmural inner layer .
18|I|Recently , several reports have appeared advocating a single-layer continuous anastomosis using monofilament plastic suture .
19|I|Because of these potential advantages , we hypothesized that the single-layer technique could be introduced into our surgical teaching program  with no increase in anastomotic failure and that it could be performed in  less time than the two-layer technique .
16|M|Patients were assigned to either the one-or two-layer technique in a prospective , randomized fashion .
14|M|All two-layer anastomoses were constructed using interrupted 3.0 silk Lembert sutures for the outer layer and a running 3.0 polyglycolic  acidsuture for the transmural inner layer .
15|M|All single-layer anastomoses were constructed using a continuous 3.0 polypropylene double-needle suture that began at the mesenteric  border (Fig. 1) .
13|R|Anastomotic failure was defined as a fistula documented radiographically or by the finding of a nonabsorbable material (charcoal) draining  from the wound after oral administration , or a visible disruption of the  suture line during reexploration .
11|R|One hundred twenty-five patients were enrolled in the study .
12|R|Fifty-nine patients were randomized to single-layer anastomoses and 66 to two-layer anastomoses .
1|D|The present study demonstrates that a single-layer continuous anastomosis is similar in terms of safety to the two-layer technique , but that it  can be constructed in a significantly shorter time and at a lower cost .
3|D|The mean time saved by creating the single-layer anastomosis , 10 minutes ,may seem relatively insignificant .
4|D|However , our study design did not include the time required to prepare the bowel for anastomosis , which is considerably less for the one-layer technique .
2|D|With the single-layer method , less circumferential clearing is required , and in many instances no clearance is necessary .
5|D|In contrast , it is difficult for an experienced surgeon to create a two-layer anastomosis in less than 20 to 25 minutes .
6|D|It was surprising to see the considerable difference in cost of materials for the anastomoses .
20|D|Most of the difference is accounted for by the cost of the silk suture packets , at $9.41 each .
7|D|The major weakness of the study is its relatively small sample size .
8|D|It is therefore difficult to make definitive statements regarding the relative risk of uncommon outcomes , such as anastomotic leakage .
9|D|To detect a significant difference in leakage rates based on our data , a power analysis indicated that 1 ,500 patients would be required .
10|D|However , our results and those in the literature are consistent and reassuring .
