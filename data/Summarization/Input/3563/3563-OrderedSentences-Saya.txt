17|I|Intestinal anastomosis has been successfully performed for more than 150 years using a variety of techniques , materials , and devices .
18|I|Recently , several reports have appeared advocating a single-layer continuous anastomosis using monofilament plastic suture .
19|I|This anastomosis requires less time to fashion , costs less than any other method , and may have a lower risk of leakage .
2|I|Because of these potential advantages , we hypothesized that the single-layer technique could be introduced into our surgical teaching program with no increase in anastomotic failure and that it could be performed in less time than the two-layer technique .
9|M|All adult patients requiring intestinal anastomosis at Denver Health Medical Center from September 1996 to September 1999 were considered eligible .
8|M|Patients were assigned to either the one-or two-layer technique in a prospective , randomized fashion .
6|M|All two-layer anastomoses were constructed using interrupted 3.0 silk Lembert sutures for the outer layer and a running 3.0 polyglycolic acid suture for the transmural inner layer .
7|M|All single-layer anastomoses were constructed using a continuous 3.0 polypropylene double-needle suture that began at the mesenteric border (Fig. 1) .
16|M|The groups were evenly matched by age , sex , diagnosis , and location of the anastomosis (Table 1) .
14|R|The present study demonstrates that a single-layer continuous anastomosis is similar in terms of safety to the two-layer technique , but that it can be constructed in a significantly shorter time and at a lower cost .
15|D|Ischemia , tension on the anastomosis , and poor technique are clearly responsible for anastomotic failure and are all under the direct control of the surgeon .
10|R|The mean time saved by creating the single-layer anastomosis , 10 minutes , may seem relatively insignificant .
11|D|However , our study design did not include the time required to prepare the bowel for anastomosis , which is considerably less for the one-layer technique .
12|R|In contrast , it is difficult for an experienced surgeon to create a two-layer anastomosis in less than 20 to 25 minutes .
13|D|Therefore , the overall time savings may be closer to 20 to 25 minutes , including bowel preparation , in experienced hands .
5|D|In today's cost-conscious environment , the use of staples for anastomoses seems irresponsible if a hand-sewn anastomosis can also be safely used in a similar time interval .
4|D|The major weakness of the study is its relatively small sample size .
1|D|We conclude that the single-layer continuous anastomosis requires less time to construct and has a similar risk of leakage compared with the two-layer technique .
3|D|It also costs less than any other method and can be safely introduced into a surgical training program with no apparent increase in complications .
20|D|For these reasons , we believe the single-layer continuous anastomosis is superior to the two-layer interrupted technique .
