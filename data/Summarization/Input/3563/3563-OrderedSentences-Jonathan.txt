4|M|All adult patients requiring intestinal anastomosis at Denver Health Medical Center from September 1996 to September 1999 were considered eligible .
4|M|Patients were assigned to either the one-or two-layer technique in a prospective , randomized fashion .
5|M|All two-layer anastomoses were constructed using interrupted 3.0 silk Lembert sutures for the outer layer and a running 3.0 polyglycolic acid suture for the transmural inner layer .
5|M|All single-layer anastomoses were constructed using a continuous 3.0 polypropylene double-needle suture that began at the mesenteric border (Fig. 1) .
3|M|Anastomotic failure was defined as a fistula documented radiographically or by the finding of a nonabsorbable material (charcoal) draining from the wound after oral administration , or a visible disruption of the suture line during reexploration .
6|M|The complication of abscess without fistula was also included in the analysis because it is potentially related to the anastomosis .
4|M|All procedures were performed by postgraduate year 3 to 5 residents from the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center assisted by an attending surgeon , or by the attending surgeons themselves .
4|R|This resulted in 65 single-layer continuous and 67 two-layer interrupted anastomoses .
4|R|The groups were evenly matched by age , sex , diagnosis , and location of the anastomosis (Table 1) .
6|R|Of the three patients in whom fistulas developed , one patient had abdominal carcinomatosis , one had diffuse peritonitis from an iatrogenic injury of the cecum that occurred during a radical resection of a gynecologic malignancy , and the third patient had been treated with an abbreviated laparotomy for trauma and was undergoing a planned reoperation .
1|D|The present study demonstrates that a single-layer continuous anastomosis is similar in terms of safety to the two-layer technique , but that it can be constructed in a significantly shorter time and at a lower cost .
9|D|These results also imply that the technique can be safely introduced into a surgical training program without a painful learning curve .
8|D|The mean time saved by creating the single-layer anastomosis , 10 minutes , may seem relatively insignificant .
8|D|The senior authors of this paper (J.M.B. , E.E.M.) have used the single-layer technique exclusively for many years and can routinely perform an anastomosis in 8 to 10 minutes .
10|D|Another surprising finding was the 2-day difference in the mean length of stay .
11|D|Because less mesentery is cleared for the single-layer anastomosis , the cut edge of the bowel is more likely to have an adequate blood supply .
12|D|Another factor is related to the properties of a continuous monofilament plastic suture line .
7|D|The major weakness of the study is its relatively small sample size .
2|D|We conclude that the single-layer continuous anastomosis requires less time to construct and has a similar risk of leakage compared with the two-layer technique .
2|D|It also costs less than any other method and can be safely introduced into a surgical training program with no apparent increase in complications .
