METHODS.

12. (M)**Women of any age with biopsy-proved primary squamous-cell carcinoma,
adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma of the cervix of stage IB
(exophytic or expansile barrel-shaped tumors with a minimal diameter of 4
cm) were eligible for the study. 

12. (M)**Patients with histologic evidence of lymph-node involvementwere not
eligible, nor were those who had previously received radiotherapy or
chemotherapy or those with a history of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin
cancer. 

12. (M)**All patients were scheduled to undergo external irradiation, intracavitary
brachytherapy, and extrafascial hysterectomy, with half the patients
randomly assigned to receive weekly intravenous infusions of cisplatin
during the period of radiotherapy. 

11. (M)**Cisplatin was given intravenously once a week at a dose of 40 mg per square
meter of body-surface area, with the total dose not to exceed 70 mg per
week. 
 
13. (M)**Extrafascial hysterectomy was performed three to six weeks after the
completion of radiotherapy
 
14. (M)**Progression-free survival was calculated from the date of entry into the
study to the date of disease recurrence, death, or the last follow-up visit.

14.(M)**Survival was calculated from the date of entry into the study to the date of
death or the last follow-up visit. 

14 (M)**Recurrences were classified as local if they were detected in the pelvis,
cervix, or vagina and as distant if they were detected in extrapelvic
locations. 

RESULTS.

9. (R) **From February 1992 to April 1997, a total of 374 women were enrolled in the
study at 48 Gynecologic Oncology Group institutions. 

10. (R)**All patients had primary cervical cancers that were at least 4 cm in
diameter, and the distribution of the tumors according to size was similar
in the two groups. 

8. (R) **The median total treatment time was 50 days in both groups (Table 2).

7. (R) **Extrafascial hysterectomy was performed after radiotherapy in 168 patients
(90 percent) in the group given radiotherapy alone and 175 patients (96
percent) in the group given radiotherapy and cisplatin.
 
2. (R) **The disease recurred in 69 patients in the group given radiotherapy alone
(37 percent) and 38 patients given radiotherapy and cisplatin (21 percent)
(Table 4). 

3. (R) **This difference predominantly reflects the fact that there were fewer local
recurrences in the combined-therapy group (16, vs. 39 in the radiotherapy
group). 

15. (R) **At the time of this analysis, the rate of progression-free survival was
significantly higher among patients in the combined-therapy group (P<0.001
by the log-rank test) (Fig. 1). 

2. (R) **The relative risk of recurrence in the combined-therapy group as compared
with the group given radiotherapy alone was 0.51 (95 percent confidence
interval, 0.34 to 0.75).

8. (R) **The median duration of follow-up was 36 months. 

2. (R) **Forty-nine of the patients in the group given radiotherapy alone died of
cervical cancer (26 percent), as compared with 27 of the patients in the
group given radiotherapy and cisplatin (15 percent) (Table 4). 

2. (R) **The relative risk of death in the combined-therapy group as compared with
the group given radiotherapy alone was 0.54 (95 percent confidence interval,
0.34 to 0.86). 

2. (R) **The threeyear survival rates were 74 percent in the group given radiotherapy
alone and 83 percent in the combined-therapy group (P=0.008 by the log-rank
test) (Fig. 2). 

16. (R) **Cox multiple regression analysis showed that the size of the tumor as
assessed by physical examination and the histologic grade of the tumor were
both significant prognostic factors. 

DISCUSSION.

2. (D) **The risk of recurrence and death was significantly reduced by concurrent
treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy. 

3. (D) **This difference appeared to be due to the lower rate of relapses in the
pelvic region in the combined-therapy group. 

4. (D) **Although this regimen was also associated with higher rates of adverse
effects, these effects consisted predominantly of transient hematologic and
gastrointestinal effects, with no evidence of an increase in other serious
effects. 

5. (D) **There was no evidence of a difference in the frequencies of late adverse
effects between the groups. 

6. (D) **We believe that the value of hysterectomy in these patients is doubtful. 

1. (D) **The five randomized trials of cervical cancer that we have discussed involve different stages of cervical cancer and combinations of treatment, but they share a common result, all five studies found that concomitant treatment with cisplatin and radiotherapy led to better outcomes than radiotherapy alone or in combination with treatments that did not include cisplatin.
 
1. (D) **This remarkable consistency offers a compelling reason to consider cisplatin in combination with radiotherapy as a new standard fo care for patients with bulky stage IB, stage IIB through IVA, and high risk cervical cancers.
