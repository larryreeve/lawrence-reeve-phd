11. (I) **Cisplatin is said to be the most active anticancer drug in cervical 
cancer,
although 100 mg/m did not significantly improve the complete response 
(CR)
rate compared prospectively with 50 mg/m (12.7 v 10%, respectively) and
there was no appreciable difference in response duration, 
progression-free
interval (PFI), or survival.Thus, there is no convincing reason to use 
a cisplatin dose higher than 50 mg/m.

 
12.  (I) **A phase II study of the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) demonstrated
activity formitolactol as a single agent in cervical cancer using 
180mg/m/d
for 10 days by mouth in repeated 4-week cycles.There were 55 assessable
patients, with one CR and 15 partial responses (PRs) (29% response 
rate). 

 
10. (I)**Ifosfamide is a new agent closely related to cyclophosphamide, but with 
less
marrow toxicity and more bladder toxicity that requires concomitant use 
of
the uroprotector mesna. 

 
Methods
 
5. (M)**Eligible patients included women with histologically confirmed advanced
(stage IVB), recurrent, or persistent squamous cell carcinoma of the 
cervix
not suitable for curative treatment with surgery and/or radiotherapy. 

5. (M)**Patients were prospectively stratified according to whether they had
received prior radiation-sensitizer treatment (hydroxyurea, 
cisplatin,or
fluorouracil) and by PS, and were then centrally randomized with equal
probability to receive (1) cisplatin 50 mg/m with appropriate hydration
every 3 weeks for a maximum of six courses, or (2) cisplatin 50 mg/m on 
day
1 plus mitolactol (180 mg/m orally for 5 days) on days 2 through 6 
every 3
weeks, or (3) cisplatin 50mg/m plus ifosfamide 5.0 g/m over 24 hours 
plus
mesna 6 g/m given concurrently with ifosfamide and for 12 hours after, 
every
3 weeks, again for a maximum of six courses.

 
5. (M)**CR was defined as the disappearance of all gross evidence of disease 
for at
least 4 weeks. 
 
5. (M)**The design for this study was based on the assumption that a 15% 
increase in
the response rate due to the addition of either mitolactolor ifosfamide 
to
cisplatin would be regarded as clinically meaningful. 

Results
 
8. (R)**Thus, there were 140 eligible patients on the cisplatin arm, 147 on the 
C +
M arm, and 151 onthe CIFX arm. 

9.  (R)**There was more granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia,and leukocytopenia
associated with C + M compared with cisplatin alone (P < .025). 

9.  (R)**Also, more granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and nausea and vomiting 
were
associated with CIFX versus cisplatin alone (P < .025)(Table 2). 
 
9.  (R)**Peripheral (P = .013) and central neurotoxicity (P = .001) were both
significantly more frequent and severe with CIFX compared with 
cisplatin
alone (Table 3), but not so for C + M. 

 
6. (R)**There was a significantly greater frequency of response(31.1%) among
patients treated with CIFX compared with cisplatin alone (17.8%, P = 
.004,
Table 4). 

6. (R)**The frequency of response among those treated with C + M (21.1%) was 
only
slightly greater than cisplatin and not statistically significant. 

6. (R)**The median durations of response among those who did respond were 5.5, 
7.7,
and 10 months, respectively, for cisplatin alone, C + M, and CIFX. 

 
6.  (R)**There was no significant difference in survival between cisplatin and 
either
of the combination regimens (median[months], cisplatin, 8.0, C + M, 
7.3,
CIFX, 8.3, P =.835) (Fig 2). 

7. (R)**Age was associated with survival (P =.025), with younger age being
unfavorable (Fig 3), this, in turn, was correlated with a shorter time 
from
diagnosis to study entry.
 

DISCUSSION.

1. (D)**The results of this trial in cervix cancer reflect a common set of 
findings in combination chemotherapy of advanced solid tumors, namely, a higher
response rate (but not a high CR rate) with a combination compared with
single-agent therapy at the cost of more toxicity and no survival 
benefit. 

2. (D)**In the present trial, there was a significant improvement in PFS 
associated
with CIFX, however, its impact on the patient's sense of well-being was 
not
assessed. 

3. (D)**Since there was no overall survival improvement, it is unclear to what
extent the improvement in PFS or in response rate actually benefitted 
the
patients.

 
4. (D)**The C + M regimen was well tolerated, but disappointing. 
 
4. (D)**Perhaps that dose of mitolactol is too low to provide an additional 
effect
with cisplatin.

4. (D)**In contrast, the present trial, which used cisplatin 50 mg/m2 plus
ifosfamide, has shown an impact on PFS.
