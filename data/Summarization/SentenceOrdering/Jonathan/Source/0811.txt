4. (I) **We chose for our evaluation the combinations of 5- FU with thymidine, 
with N-(phosphonacetyl)-Laspartic acid (PALA), with levamisole, and with 
methyl CCNU, vincristine, and streptozotocin (MOF-Strept).

5. (I) **We elected to use survival as our primary endpoint in patients with 
both measurable and nonmeasurable disease and also to evaluate objective 
response rates among those patients with measurable disease.

METHODS.

3. (M) **All patients were required to have histologic or cytologic confirmation 
of unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer.
 
5. (M) **Measurable disease was defined as a tumor mass that could be clearly
measured in two dimensions on either physical examination or chest 
x-ray. 

6. (M) **5-FU alone. 5-FU was administered in undiluted form by rapid 
intravenous (IV) injection at a dose of 500 mg/m2 daily for 5 consecutive days. 

6. (M) **Thymidine was administered by a single IV infusion over 90 minutes at a
total dose of 45 g. 
 
6. (M) **PALA was administered by rapid IV injection at a dose of 625 mg/m2/d 
for 5 consecutive days. 

6. (M) **Levamisole was administered orally at a dose of 50 mg every 8 hours on 
days 14, 15. and 16, and days 21. 22. and 23 of each 5- FU cycle. 

6. (M) **MOF-Strept. 5-FU was administered in undiluted form by rapid IV 
injection at a dose of 300 mg/m 2/d on days I through 5 and 36 through 40. 

6. (M) **Methyl CCNU was administered orally at a dosage of 30 mg/m 2/d on days 
2 through 6. 

6. (M) **Vincristine was administered by rapid IV injection at a dose of I mg/m 
2 on days I and 36. 

6. (M) **Streptozotocin was administered by rapid IV injection at a dose of 500 
mg/m2
on day I and every 7 days thereafter. 

5. (M) **The primary endpoint of our overall study was patient survival. 

RESULTS
 
17. (R) **A total of 335 eligible patients were properly started on therapy and 
are included in the analysis below. 

7. (R) **At the time of this writing the study is very mature with 318 patients 
(95%) having shown progressive disease and 278 patients (83%) having been 
followed to the time of death.  

8. (R) **MOF-Strept was characterized by substantially more frequent and more 
severe nausea and vomiting, and this was the only regimen characterized by a
substantive incidence of thrombocytopenia. 
 
8. (R) **5-FU plus PALA had substantially more frequent mucocutaneous reactions and somewhat more frequent diarrhea, but less hematologic toxicity than 5-FU alone or any of the other regimens. 

8. (R) **On the other hand, 5-FU plus thymidine had a reduced incidence of
mucocutaneous reactions and of diarrhea with comparable hematologic 
toxicity when compared with 5-FU alone. 

9. (R) **The most unique toxicity of this regimen was a substantially increased
incidence of neurologic effects. 

2. (R) **None of the combination regimens showed a significant advantage to 5-FU 
used alone. 

10. (R) **It is noteworthy that while the MOF-Strept regimen had the highest
regression rate, it was also the regimen with the lowest proportion of
patients whose disease remained stable and the highest proportion of
patients in whom the best response observed was tumor regression. 

10. (R) **Whereas 5-FU plus PALA was associated with the lowest regression rate, 
these regressions were of the longest median duration. 

2. (R) **There was no suggestion that any of the combination regimens performed 
in a superior fashion to 5-FU used alone, and it is unlikely that any could
produce as much as a 50% increase in time to progression (P < .05) for 
each regimen v 5-FU alone. 

11. (R) **Grade of anaplasia also proved to be a powerful prognostic predictor. 

12. (R) **This factor was imbalanced among our treatment regimens, but this 
imbalance clearly weighed against the 5-FU arm that had the lowest proportion of
low-grade lesions and the highest proportion of highly anaplastic tumors. 

13. (R) **The median survival for all patients was 81/4 months.
 
2. (R) **None of the combination regimens showed a significant superiority to 
5-FU used alone. 

2. (R) **There is no reasonable possibility that a 50% (4 month) increase in 
survival could be obtained for any regimen in comparison with 5-FU alone. 

DISCUSSION

14. (D) **The results of this study were singularly discouraging. 

1. (D) **In spite of the fact that the patients tested were in very good overall
general condition with no previous chemotherapy exposure, none of our
experimental regimens produced any meaningful advantage over therapy 
with simple 5-FU alone and none can be recommended for standard practice.  

15. (D) **In each of the regimens we tested, drug dosages and scheduling were
admittedly largely arbitrary. 

16. (D) **Our experience with the 5-FU-levamisole combination was particularly
discouraging in view of the early study of the University of Wisconsin,
indicating that this combination could produce substantial survival
improvement.
