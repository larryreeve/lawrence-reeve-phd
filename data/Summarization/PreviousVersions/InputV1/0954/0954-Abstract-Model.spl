BackgroundRadiotherapy after mastectomy to treat early breast cancer has been known since the 1940s to reduce rates of local relapse .
However ,  theroutine use of postoperative radiotherapy began to decline in the 1980s because it failed to improve overall survival .
We prospectively tested the efficacy of combining radiotherapy with chemotherapy .
MethodsFrom 1978 through 1986 ,  318 premenopausal women with node-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned ,  after modified radical mastectomy ,  to receive chemotherapy plus radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone .
Radiotherapy was given to the chest wall and locoregional lymph nodes between the fourth and fifth cycles of cyclophosphamide ,  methotrexate ,  and fluorouracil .
ResultsAfter 15 years of follow-up ,  the women assigned to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy had a 33 percent reduction in the rate of recurrence (relative risk ,  0.67; 95 percent confidence interval ,  0.50 to 0.90) and a 29 percent reduction in mortality from breast cancer (relative risk ,  0.71; 95 percent confidence interval ,  0.51 to 0.99) ,  as compared with the women treated with chemotherapy alone .
ConclusionsRadiotherapy combined with chemotherapy after modified radical mastectomy decreases rates of locoregional and systemic relapse and reduces mortality from breast cancer .
