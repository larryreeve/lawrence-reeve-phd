BACKGROUND: The influence of leukapheresis size on the number of harvested peripheral blood progenitor cells is still unclear. A prospective randomized crossover trial was thus performed, to evaluate the effect of large volume leukapheresis (LVL) versus normal-volume leukapheresis (NVL) on progenitor cells and engraftment in 26 patients with breast cancer and 15 patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma who were eligible for peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to undergo either LVL on Day 1 and on Day 2 or vice versa. The number of progenitor cells was evaluated in the harvest and before and after leukapheresis in the peripheral blood.

RESULTS: The number of harvested CD34+ cells (4.8 × 106 vs. 3.4 × 106/kg body weight, p<0.001) and colonyforming units–granulocyte-macrophage (3.1 × 105 vs. 2.4 × 105/kg body weight, p = 0.0026) was significantly higher for LVL procedures than for NVL procedures. The median extraction efficacy, defined as the difference between the yield in the harvest and the decrease in the
total number of CD34+ cells in peripheral blood during leukapheresis, was significantly (p<0.0001) higher for LVL than for NVL (2.6 × 108 and 8 × 107, respectively). In patients with breast cancer, the median amount of CD34+ cells in the harvest and the median extraction efficacy were higher for LVL than for NVL (p<0.0001). This was not found for patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

CONCLUSION: LVL results in a higher yield of CD34+ cells and colony-forming units–granulocyte-macrophage than NVL, but only in patients with breast cancer and with high numbers of CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood before leukapheresis.
