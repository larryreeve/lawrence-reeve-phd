This trial compares HAI FUDR to conventional palliation which included analgesics , corticosteroids , and systemic chemotherapy .
We are not told how many of the controls received chemtherapy .
There was appropriate power to detect a survival difference of 30% and there was no cross over allowed .
The main outcome studied was quality of life and there is no difference between the groups .
Survival was nearly doubled and quality of life was maintained .
The morbidity of the pump placement was generally minor and patients were able to receive a significant amount of FUDR without prohibitive morbidity or compromising quality of life .
This is a very important study and answers the question that it answers .  
It obviously doesn't address the use of systemic chemotherapy in a systematic way .
