Multiinstitutional prospective randomized trial to determine the influence on survival of 5-FU alone or in combination with other agents in metastatic colorectal cancer . 
Overall , no improvement in survival with any of the agents . 
Compared to 5-FU alone , PALA added an increase in the mucocutaneous toxicity , thymidine increased the neurotoxicity , levamisole had no increase in toxicity but none improved survival or disease progression . 
MOF-Strept combination resulted in a high response rate with worsened thrombocytopenia, nausea and vomiting and no increase in duration of  life . 
Therefore , none of these regimens can be recommended compared to 5-FU alone .
