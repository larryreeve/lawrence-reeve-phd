Purpose: To determine the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane (DZR) used in a doxorubicin-based combination therapy in advanced breast cancer .
Patients and Methods: Between November 1988 and January 1991 ,  534 patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to two multicenter ,  double-blind studies (088001 and 088006) .
Patients received fluorouracil ,  doxorubicin ,  and cyclophosphamide (FAC) with either DZR (DZR-to-doxorubicin ratio ,  10:1) or placebo (PLA) every 3 weeks and were monitored with serial multiplegated acquisition (MUGA) scans .
Results: The hazards ratio (HR) of PLA to DZR for a carci-c event ,  which was predefined ejection fraction changes or congestive heart failure (CHF) ,  was 2.63 (95% confidence interval [Cl] ,  1.61 to 4.27; P < .001) for 088001 and 2.00 (95% CI ,  1.01 to 3.96; P = .038) for088006. The objective response rates for 088001 were 46.8% for DZR and 60.5% for PLA ,  a difference of 14% (95% Cl ,  -25% to -2%; P = .019) ,  and for 088006 were 53.7% for DZR and 49.3% for PLA ,  a difference of 4% (95% CI ,  -13% to 22%; P = .63) .
Time to progressionand survival were not significantly different between treatment arms in either study .
Toxicities on the DZR arms included lower granulocyte and platelet counts at nadir (P = .009 and P = .004 ,  respectively) and more pain on injection (P = .001) ,  with no difference in the rates of fever ,  infection ,  or hemorrhage .
Conclusion: DZR had a significant cardioprotective effect as measured by noninvasive testing and clinical CHF .
One of the two studies (088001) showed a lower response rate with DZR ,  but time to progression and survival were not significantly different .
DZR is the firstagent shown to reduce cardiotoxicity from doxorubicin .
