Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Adult Soft Tissue Sarcomas of the Extremities and Girdles, Results of the Italian Randomized Cooperative Trial. 

Adjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma is controversial because previous trials reported conflicting results. 

The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 48 months in the treatment group and 16 months in the control group (P = .04), and the median overall survival (OS) was 75 months for treated and 46 months for untreated patients (P = .03).
