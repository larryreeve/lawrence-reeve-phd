Peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation has become a widely accepted therapeutic option for patients with  chemotherapy-sensitive malignancies. In 50 percent of previously treated patients it has been possible to harvest more than 1.0 × 106 CD34+ cells per kg of BW in a  single LVL procedure. The main evaluation criteria of the study were the comparison of  the number of CD34+ cells per harvest and the extraction efficacy for CD34+ cells in LVL and NVL. Extraction efficacy was defined as the number of CD34+ cells per leukapheresis – (the number of CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood before  leukapheresis – the number of CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood after leukapheresis). Patients <60 years with high-risk BC or NHL were included in the protocol. All  patients with chemotherapy-sensitive disease were eligible. Patients and study population
During the study period, a total of 100 patients underwentPBPC mobilization and harvest. 1). In 2 of the 41 remaining patients, CD34+ cell counts after leukapheresis were not performed. Twenty-six patients had BC  and 15 patients had NHL. Mobilization and leukapheresis
All patients underwent mobilization with chemotherapy and G–CSF. The numbers of CD34+ cells before leukapheresis and in the leukapheresis component were evaluated in all 82  harvest procedures. In 3 apheresis procedures, the number of CD34+ cells after leukapheresis was not determined (NVL: n = 1,  LVL: n = 2).

Transplantation
Patients with low-grade NHL underwent conditioning with  total body irradiation (12 Gy) and highdose cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg BW). One patient underwent transplantation twice, and  thus a total of 38 PBPC transplantations were performed in 37 patients. One patient with NHL underwent transplantation with  autologous bone marrow and PBPCs, because neither the bone marrow cells nor the PBPCs were sufficient for transplantation as  a single source of progenitor cells. Yield of CD34+ cells and extraction efficacy The median number of CD34+ cells was significantly higher in LVL than in NVL  (Table 3 and Fig. 2). In five patients with BC and seven with NHL, the NVL component contained more CD34+ cells than did the  LVL component. In relation to BW, the median values were 3.5 × 106 CD34+ cells per kg of BW for LVL and 1.1 × 106 CD34+ cells per kg of BW for NVL (p<0.0001). The median number of CD34+ cells per µL in peripheral blood before leukapheresis did not  differ for either group of patients or either procedure. But patients with BC had significantly higher (p = 0.012 and p =  0.028, respectively) median numbers of CD34+ cells per µL in peripheral blood before leukapheresis than patients with NHL had  (LVL: 61 vs. 24; NVL: 64 vs. 23). Transplantation
In 36  patients, 37 transplantations with PBPCs alone were performed. One patient with BC underwent transplantation twice. One other  patient received both autologous bone marrow and autologous PBPCs. In PBPC transplantation, patients received a median of 2.7  × 106 CD34+ cells per kg of BW (range, 1.0-7.8 × 106) and a median of 2.0 × 105 CFU–GM per kg of BW after cryopreservation (range, 0.7-10.4 × 105). Twenty-five transplantations were performed in 24 patients with grafts from study leukapheresis  procedures alone. Seventeen  patients, 14 with BC and 3 with NHL, received a graft from an LVL. Two patients with NHL received the LVL and the NVL graft.

We analyzed in a prospective controlled study the efficacy of LVL in 41 patients with BC or NHL. When all procedures were  considered, the median number of CD34+ cells and the median extraction efficacy were significantly higher in LVL than in NVL.  The number of “recruited” CD34+  cells per kg of BW is in the magnitude of 1 (NVL) to 3.5 (LVL) times that in a transplantation dose. During LVL, patients received significant amounts of heparin. The difference in extraction efficacy between the BC and NHL patient groups could be an explanation for the different correlation coefficients between preapheresis numbers of CD34+ cells per µL in peripheral blood and the  CD34+ cell yield in the harvest. In our study, 14.6 percent and 24.4 percent of the patients failed to achieve 1 and 2 × 106, respectively, CD34+ cells per kg of BW with an LVL. Our data suggest that patients with BC and with high numbers of CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood before leukapheresis  obviously profit from a substantial recruitment of PBPCs during an LVL, whereas other patients do not.
