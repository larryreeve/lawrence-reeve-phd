For premenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer, the classic  treatment is ovariectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment
Patients with previous systemic endocrine or chemotherapeutic  treatment for advanced disease were not eligible. RESULTS
Patient and Tumor Characteristics
The protocol violations  included incorrect receptor status (three patients), postmenopausal status (one patient),  neoadjuvant chemotherapy (one patient), brain metastasis (one patient), treatment refusal (one  patient), and early termination of tamoxifen after 3 days because of hot flashes (one patient).  Thus, data from 145 patients could be evaluated for response (Table 1). In total, 149 patients showed disease progression and 122 (76%) of the
161 patients died, all of breast cancer. The patient and tumor characteristics were well balanced  over the three treatment groups (Table 2). Excluding patients who could not be evaluated, the objective response rate (complete remission and  partial remission) was better in the group treated with the combination therapy (23 of 48 patients;  48%) than in the groups treated with buserelin alone (16 of 47 patients; 34%) or tamoxifen alone  (14 of 50 patients; 28%) Response rates in patients in the  single-treatment arms compared with those in the combined-treatment arm were different and led to  unadjusted P values of .169 for buserelin and .042 for tamoxifen. In contrast, the response rates  in patients treated with buserelin alone and in patients treated with tamoxifen alone were much  more similar (P 4 .52).

The three treatment arms differed statistically significantly from each other with regard to  progression-free survival (Table 3), with the median times to disease progression being 9.7 months  for patients in the combined-treatment group, 6.3 months for patients treated with buserelin alone,  and 5.6 months for patients treated with tamoxifen alone (P 4 .03; overall logrank test) (Fig. 1).  Compared with patients in the combined-treatment arm, patients  treated with buserelin or tamoxifen alone showed poor progression-free survival, with hazard ratios  of 1.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4 1.09–2.49) and 1.50 (95% CI 4 1.01–2.24), respectively  (Table 3).

Separate comparisons of the single-treatment arms to the combined-treatment arm showed differences  in progression-free survival for both single-treatment arms and led to unadjusted P values of .008  for buserelin and .047 for tamoxifen. Progression free survival values for patients treated with  buserelin alone and for patients treated with tamoxifen alone were very similar (P4.71).  Thirty-five (66%) of the 53 patients in the combined treatment group died, 43 (80%) of the 54  patients in the group treated with buserelin alone died, and 44 (81%) of the 54 patients in the  group treated with tamoxifen alone died. Separate comparisons of  overall survival among patients in the single-treatment arms and in the combined-treatment arm  showed that these values were statistically significantly different, with unadjusted P values of  .006 for buserelin and .029 for tamoxifen. The median overall survival was  longer in patients after combined treatment (3.7 years) than in patients after treatment with  buserelin alone (2.5 years) or tamoxifen alone (2.9 years) (P 4 .01) (Table 3). The death hazard  ratios for patients treated with buserelin alone or tamoxifen alone were 1.95 (95% CI 4 1.23–3.10)  and 1.63 (95% CI 4 1.03–2.59), respectively, when compared with patients receiving the combined  treatment. 

The 5-year actuarial survival was higher for patients in the combined-treatment group (34.2%; 95%  CI 4 20.4%–48.0%), with a difference of 15.8%–19.3% in comparison to that for patients treated with  buserelin alone (14.9%; 95% CI 43.9%–25.9%) or tamoxifen alone (18.4%; 95% CI 4 7.0%–29.8%) For survival after disease progression, there was a borderline statistically significant difference  among the three treatment arms (P 4 .06), with the median time to death from disease progression  being 29 months for patients in the combined-treatment group, 18.3 months for patientstreated with  buserelin alone, and 27.1 months for patients treated with tamoxifen alone (Fig. 3). Compared with  patients receiving combined treatment, patients treated with buserelin alone or tamoxifen alone  showed hazard ratios of 1.7–1.45 for survival after disease progression. For survival after disease  progression, comparison of the single-treatment arms with the combined treatment arm showed  differences, with unadjusted P values of .03 for buserelin alone and .088 for tamoxifen alone.  The interaction between treatment and disease-free interval, however, was not statistically significant for progression-free survival (P 4 .43) and overall survival (P 4 .93). 

The objective response rate was 59% for patients  with soft-tissue disease, 27% for patients with bone metastases, and 39% for patients with visceral  metastases. All patients with at least one estradiol measurement result before and/or during treatment were  included in the endocrine study. Hot flashes occurred less frequently (P<.001) during treatment with  tamoxifen alone (17 of 43 patients; 40%) than during treatment with buserelin alone (38 of 43  patients; 88%) or during the combination treatment (41 of 47 patients; 87%). Amenorrhea also  developed less often (P<.001) during treatment with tamoxifen (nine of 38 patients; 24%) than  during treatment with buserelin alone (39 of 40 patients; 98%) or combined treatment (44 of 44  patients; 100%). Nausea was reported by five patients (three with WHO grade 1 and two with WHO grade 2; 12%) treated with tamoxifen alone, one patient (grade 1) receiving combined treatment, and  no patients treated with buserelin alone. From an endocrine point of view, treatment with  tamoxifen and buserelin resulted in important differences. Combined treatment also had a 14%–20% higher objective response rate, although the  difference in response rate was not statistically significant (P 4 .11; Table 3). A small Italian study of 85 patients that had a two by-two factorial study design and 18–24  patients per treatmentgroup demonstrated a higher response rate in patients treated with goserelin  plus tamoxifen (45%) than in patients treated with goserelin alone (27%). A second, larger international study of 318  patients showed, in concordance with our study, a statistically significantly improved progression-free survival after combined treatment compared with that after a single treatment with goserelin  (P 4 .03) but no statistically significant improvement in the survival or objective response rate (38% versus 31%). results of a recent meta-analysis of 506 patients treated in four randomized trials (including this  study) showed that, for all three efficacy parameters (i.e., response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival), combined treatment with an LHRH agonist plus tamoxifen was  superior to treatment with an LHRH agonist alone. The overall survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer is commonly  comparable for combined endocrine treatment and sequential treatment. In conclusion, our unique three-arm, randomized study clearly showed that combined treatment with  an LHRH agonist plus tamoxifen is superior to treatment with each drug alone, with respect to  response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival among premenopausal patients with  metastatic breast cancer. We suggest that future studies also add aromatase inhibitors to  the combined-treatment regimen; this treatment should further suppress plasma estradiol levels.
