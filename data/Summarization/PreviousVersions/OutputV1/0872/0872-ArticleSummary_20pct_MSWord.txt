PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Study 088006 included patients with nonmeasurable disease from the onset. Study Design
Each patient was assigned to a treatment arm according to a prospectively prepared randomization list. January 14, 1991, patients who were randomized to either arm of the studies and had received a cumulative dose of at least 300 mg/m2 of doxorubicin subsequently received open-label DZR. In study 088001, the initial dose ratio of the blinded study drug (DZR or PLA) to doxorubicin was 20:1 (DZR 1,000 mg/m2). During the first 9 months of the study, six deaths occurred on the DZR arm of 088001; five deaths occurred on the DZR arm of a parallel study (088002, a small-cell lung cancer study using a 20:1 dose). Throughout study 088006, the dose ratio of study drug to doxorubicin was 10:1.

Dose Modifications
Off-Study Criteria
Patients were removed from the study if they developed progressive disease, a cardiac event, or other toxicity that precluded further treatment. The analyses presented in this report focus on 534 patients (349 on study 088001 and 185 on study 088006) who received the 10:1 dose ratio of DZR or PLA to doxorubicin and were randomized before January 14, 1991. For patients in the DZR and PLA groups, the cumulative doxorubicin dose at cardiac event was plotted using Kaplan-Meier curves and the doses were compared using the log-rank and generalized Wilcoxon tests. There were 82 cardiac events in study 088001 and 43 in study 088006. Between May 1989 and December 1992, 326 patients from 65 institutions entered study 088006 and were randomized to receive FAC plus DZR or FAC plus PLA. Table 1 lists all patients randomized onto the two studies. They include patients randomized to the 20:1 dose ratio (study drug to doxorubicin) before the dose change. These patients received one or more cycles at the 20:1 dose ratio. There were 349 patients on study 088001 and 185 on study 088006. The median follow-up time on study
088001 was 532 days (range, 1 to 1,863) for the 168 patients who received DZR and 511 days (range, 1 to 1,652) for the 181 patients who received PLA. The median follow-up time on study 088006 was 397 days (range, 6 to 1,393) for the 81 patients who received DZR and 517 days (range, 29 to 1,429) for the 104 patients who received PLA.

There were nine patients (four on study 088001 and five on study 088006) randomized and not treated. There were 34 patients taken off studies 088001 and 088006 for protocol violations, including one patient who was never treated. There were eight on the DZR arm
and 15 on the PLA arm in study 088001, and six on the DZR arm and five on the PLA arm in study 088006. The treatment groups were well balanced for all patient characteristics. Table 4 displays the number of patients who experienced a cardiac event, while Fig 1A and B shows Kaplan-Meier curves comparing the DZR and PLA patients with regard to cumulative doxorubicin dose to cardiac event. In study 088001, 15% of DZR patients and 31% of PLA patients experienced a cardiac event, whereas in study 088006, these proportions were 14% and 31%. Table 4 shows that 24 patients from both studies (16 on study 088001 and eight on study 088006) developed CHF either on or off study. Two of these patients were randomized to receive DZR and 22 to PLA. The two patients (one on study 088001 and one on study 088006) who died of CHF were on the PLA arm and had received 450 mg/m2 and 500 mg/m2 of doxorubicin. Response Rate Results of the initial review of objective response rates (CRs and PRs) for patients with bidimensional measurable disease demonstrated a significantly higher objective response rate in patients on study 088001 who received PLA (63%) than in those who received DZR (48%) Response rates were not significantly different in study 088006. The objective response rates for study 088001 were 46.8% for DZR and 60.5% for PLA, whereas for study 088006 they were 53.7% for DZR and 49.3% for PLA. The differences between the objective response rates in the DZR and PLA arm were -14% (95% CI, -25% to -2%; P = .019) in study 88001 and 4% (95% CI, -13% to 22%; P = .63) in study 088006. The response rate for patients on study 088001 who had received prior chemotherapy was 41% on the DZR arm versus 58% on the PLA arm, a difference of 17% (95% CI, -36% to 2%; P = .072), and for patients who had received prior hormonal therapy was 45% for the DZR arm and 61% for the PLA arm, a difference of 16% (95% CI, -33% to 1%; P = .065). Response rates for patients on study 088006 who had received previous chemotherapy for the DZR arm were 53% and for the PLA arm were 52%, a difference of 1% (95% CI, -30% to 32%; P = .95), and for previous hormonal therapy or the DZR arm were 44% and for the PLA arm were 53%, a difference of 9% (95% CI, -35% to 17%; P = .50).

The median time to progression was 254 days for patients in the DZR arm and 260 days for patients in the PLA arm. The time to progression for patients who had received previous chemotherapy and that for patients who had received prior hormonal therapy were not significantly different between treatment arms for either study 088001 or 088006. The median survival time in study 088001 was 598 days in the DZR arm and 551 in the PLA arm, whereas in study 088006 it was 458 days and 553 days, respectively. Dose Modification
were still no significant differences between arms. Noncardiac Toxicity
Patients who received DZR and patients who received PLA in both studies were compared with regard to their highest toxicity grade experienced during courses before crossover to open-label DZR. Granulocyte counts were significantly lower at nadir for the patients on the DZR arms (P = .009). Patients on the DZR arms had a 47% incidence of grade 1 thrombocytopenia, whereas patients on the PLA arms had a 29% incidence. The only significant finding was a lower WBC nadir for patients who received DZR. Seventeen of 249 patients (6.8%) were on the DZR arms and 18 of 285 patients (6.3%) were on the LA arms. Twenty of 534 patients (3.7%) died while on study. Because early analysis of these studies uncovered evidence of significant cardioprotection, in January 1991, patients on the PLA arm received open-label DZR starting with their seventh course or a cumulative dose of 300 mg/m 2 doxorubicin. Cumulative doxorubicin doses - 1,000 mg/m2 were given to 14% of patients randomized to receive DZR, without cardiotoxicity. There were no differences in objective response rates or noncardiac toxicity between treatment arms. The current reported studies were designed to test the hypothesis that DZR reduces doxorubicin-associated cardiotoxicity. The majority of cardiac events were changes in LVEF and not CHF, although 4.5% of patients who entered studies 088001 and 088006 developed CHF secondary to doxorubicin treatment. However, 1% of the patients on the DZR
arms developed CHF compared with 8% on the PLA arms. Although study 088001 shows a lower response rate with DZR, no other data support this result. to progression were significantly improved in patients who received continuous therapy. Toxicity was greater in the continuous arm, and some patients requested cessation of therapy. Future studies of DZR will focus on evaluating the merit of continuing doxorubicin treatment beyond six courses of  FAC in breast cancer patients who respond to treatment. In addition, studies are planned for pediatric patients, patientswith cardiac risk factors, combination studies of doxorubicin with other chemotherapy agents and DZR with the initiation of therapy, studies with dose-intensified doxorubicin, studies with anthracyclines other than doxorubicin, and studies in patients with other tumor types.
