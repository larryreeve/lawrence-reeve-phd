Summary-Abstract:
Summary (2 StdDev, Compression=0.25,3 of 9)
-------------

0) Within the two series,no difference was detected between pre- and postmenopausal patients (CMF 12, 59.3% versus 57.6%, CMF 6, 66.5% versus 63.1%), while findings were inversely related to the number of involved axillary nodes. 
1) Present results after 12 CMF cycles are almost identical to those of our first CMF adjuvant study. 
2) Current findings are sufficiently mature to indicate that the maximum tumor cytoreduction with CMF occurs within a relatively short period of time.

Summary (2 StdDev, Compression=0.25,22 of 88)

0) This report presents our findingsafter 15 years of follow-up.
1) The mastectomywas performed according to standard surgical practice between1979 and 1986. 
2) After written informed consent was obtained,the patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups,those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy plus locoregional radiotherapyin five fields (the chemotherapy–radiotherapy group, with164 patients) and those receiving chemotherapy alone (the chemotherapygroup, with 154 patients). 
3) ChemotherapyThe chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (600 mgper square meter of body-surface area), methotrexate (40 mg persquare meter), and fluorouracil (600 mg per square meter) (theCMF regimen), given intravenously every 21 days as described byBonadonna et al.,
4) Survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method.
5) All 11 patients were alive and had no recurrences attheir last known follow-up. 
6) Eight patients randomlyassigned to chemotherapy had radiotherapy at their own requestor that of their physicians. 
7) Therewas no difference with regard to any survival endpoint between the patients who had 12 months ofchemotherapy and those who had only 6 monthsP 0.60 for disease-free survival at 15 years, P 0.70for overall survival).
8) These valuestranslate into an overall reduction of 33 percent inthe rate of recurrence of breast cancer (relative risk,0.67, 95 percent confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.90,P 0.007), with an improvement of 17 percentagepoints in disease-free survival at the 15-year followup(Fig. 1). 
9) There was an overall reduction of 34percent in the rate of systemic recurrence (relativerisk, 0.66, 95 percent confidence interval, 0.49 to0.89, P 0.006) in the group treated with combinedtherapy (75 of 164 patients vs. 94 of 154 patients in the group treated only with chemotherapy), and a17-percentage-point improvement in systemic disease-free survival (Fig. 2). 
10) There were no statisticallysignificant differences between these subgroups withregard to either survival free of systemic disease(P for interaction 0.9) or rates of locoregional recurrence(P 0.73).
11) Side Effects of RadiationArm edema developed in 15 of the 154 irradiatedpatients. 
12) Interventions were required in six (an elasticsleeve in four, a pump in one, and physiotherapyin one), as compared with five patients in the chemotherapygroup, one of whom required physiotherapy.
13) Limited apical lung fibrosis developed inmost of the irradiated patients, but only one had interstitialpneumonitis requiring corticosteroids, withfull resolution on chest radiography several weekslater. 
14) In one patient with a right-sided breast lesion,congestive heart failure developed 14 years after radiotherapy, at the age of 63. 
15) We considered thisevent related not to the adjuvant radiation but ratherto treatment with doxorubicin, which was givenat a cumulative dose of 540 mg for metastases to thelung and pleura. 
16) These studies, however, included all the radiationtrials started in the 1960s, using older equipmentand radiation techniques and considered obsolete bypresent standards. 
17) The other eight studies were notsimilar to ours or the Danish trial, either because thenumber of randomized premenopausal patients wassmall or because the radiotherapy techniques or thechemotherapy schedules were heterogeneous.
18) Therefore, it may be necessaryto add nodal radiation to breast irradiation inpremenopausal node-positive patients who are treatedwith partial mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy.
19) Locoregional radiation is not routinely used atpresent in patients with node-positive breast cancer,although it is coming into use to treat patients with10 or more positive nodes and occasionally thosewith 4 or more positive nodes. 
20) The routine use ofradiation in all node-positive patients would representa substantial shift in treatment for breast cancer.
21) The elimination of locoregionalcancer cells by radiotherapy added to adjuvantchemotherapy may reduce mortality in selectedpatients with breast cancer.
