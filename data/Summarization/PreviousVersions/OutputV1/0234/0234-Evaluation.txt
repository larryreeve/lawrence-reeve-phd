0) Fifty-four patients with advanced breast cancer who had failed prior non-anthracycline combination chemotherapy were randomized to treatment with either epirubicin 85 mg/m2 or doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 intravenously every three weeks. 
1) The median duration of response to epirubicin was 11.9 months compared to 7.1 months with doxorubicin. 
2) Using methods of survival analysis, the median doses to the development of laboratory cardiotoxicity were estimated to be 935 mg/m2 of epirubicin and 468 mg/m2 of doxorubicin.

0) DOXORUBICIN (DOX), or Adriamycin(Adria Laboratories, Columbus, Ohio), isone of the most useful antineoplastic agentsavailable. 
1) Its use, however, is limited by cumulative,dose-dependent, chronic cardiotoxicity. 
2) More recently, however, subclinical cardiacinjury has been documented at considerably lowerdoses. 
3) Discontinuation of therapy in these patientsmay prevent cardiac failure, but also results incurtailment of the antineoplastic effect of DOX.
4) One approach to solving this problem is thedevelopment of DOX analogues that retain antineoplasticactivity but possess reduced potentialfor cardiac damage. 
5) Preclinical studies suggestthat this may be possible by structural alterationof the anthracyline molecule.'1 Epirubicin (4'-epi-doxorubicin, EPI) is one such compound. 
6) Itis a stereoisomer of DOX in which the hydroxylgroup at the 4' position of the aminosugar side chain is epimerized (Fig 1). 
7) Pharmacokinetic studies in tumor-bearing miceand rats" indicate that EPI is more extensivelymetabolized by liver than DOX. 
8) The two compoundshave similar pharmacokinetic behavior inhumans, although EPI is eliminated more rapidly.
9) In two clinical phase I studies, EPI was foundto have acceptable toxicity at doses of 85 to 90mg/m2 given intravenously (IV) every threeweeks. 
10) We used multigated radionuclidecineangiocardiography (RNCA) to assess cardiactoxicity in this prospective, randomized studycomparing the efficacy, acute, and chronic toxicitiesof EPI with DOX in patients with advancedbreast cancer.
11) MATERIALS AND METHODSPatient EligibilityThis study was conducted in patients with advanced breastcancer who had progressed after receiving combination chemotherapy.
12) Areas of increased uptake on bonescan were further studied with roentgenograms to determine thenature of the abnormalities. 
13) Liver scans were done only if therewas elevation of the hepatic enzymes on the biochemical profile.
14) Blood counts were initially monitored weekly, and then lessfrequently after the pattern of myelosuppression was established.
15) Allevaluable or measurable parameters of disease were reevaluatedat least every six weeks.
16) Randomization was performed using the method of randompermuted blocks, which assured an equal number of patientsin each arm at specified time points.
17) It was anticipatedthat these doses would produce equivalent degrees of myelosuppression.
18) Doses were adjusted based on the degree of myelosuppressionobserved using a predetermined schedule. 
19) Neitherpatients nor physicians were blinded with respect to treatment.
20) Any patient whodeveloped progressive disease within three months of startingtherapy was considered to have progressed even if she had demonstratedtransient tumor regression. 
21) Evaluation of ToxicityThe percent of projected dose received was calculated foreach patient as the average of all doses the patient received(mg/m 2) - 85 if the patient was randomized to EPI and - 60 ifthe patient was randomized to DOX.
22) Cardiac toxicity was assessed in all patients by both clinicalevaluation and RNCA. 
23) RNCA was done with thepatients in supine position at rest and during maximum symptom limited bicycle exercise. 
24) Patients' RBCs were labeled invivo by injecting 10 to 20 mCi of technetium 99m IV 30 minutesafter stannous pyrophosphate injection. 
25) Images of the left ventriclewere recorded by positioning the camera in the left anterioroblique position, using a computer-based procedure gated to theelectrocardiogram. 
26) In our laboratory, during theperiod of time that this study was conducted, the reproducibilityof LVEF determination by RNCA was + 5%. 
27) Althoughall patients had received prior chemotherapywhich included cyclophosphamide orother alkylating agent, no patient had been previously treated with mitomycin C. 
28) Doses werereduced more frequently on the DOX arm ascompared to the EPI arm, in which two patients'doses were escalated. 
29) The median actual doseadministered was 100% of the projected dose ofEPI and 86% of the planned dose of DOX (Wilcoxontest, P = .01).
30) Response Rates and DurationsTwenty-four patients on the EPI arm and 28patients on the DOX arm are evaluable for therapeuticresponse (Table 2). 
31) Six (25%) of the 24 evaluable patientstreated with EPI and seven (25%) of the 28 evaluablepatients on the DOX arm achieved PRs. 
32) Inaddition, on the EPI arm, one patient experiencedan MR and eight patients had stable disease.
33) Although the major responserates did not differ between the two arms (chisquaretest, P = .98), the difference in durationof response is of borderline significance (logranktest, P = .11). 
34) Of the 13 patientswith PRs, six had tumors that were estrogen receptorpositive, six had estrogen receptor negativetumors, and in one patient the estrogenreceptor value was unknown. 
35) The median WBC nadir was 2.0x 103/gL (range, 0.1 to 8.6) and the medianplatelet nadir was 132 x 103//pL (range, 20.0 to279.0) in patients receiving EPI, the medianWBC nadir was 1.8 x 10'/3tL (range, 0.3 to 6.9)and median platelet nadir was 130 x 103/pL(range 24.0 to 253.0) in patients on the DOXarm. 
36) Other common toxicities included nausea,vomiting, and alopecia. 
37) Ofthe 15 evaluable patients treated with EPI, sixhad received prior radiotherapy to the chest wall,internal mammary lymph nodes, sternum, orthoracic spine prior to entry on this study, andtwo had a history of well-controlled mild hypertension.
38) A decrease in LVEF of > 5% with stress wasnot observed in the absence of a > 10% decreasein resting LVEF from baseline. 
39) Nor did all patients experience asteady progressive decline in LVEF, most maintaineda stable LVEF until there was an acutedecrease. 
40) One of the patients who developedCHF on the DOX arm is the patient who had theinitial resting LVEF of 48%, this patient also hada history of pulmonary emboli and it was unclearwhether this contributed to her cardiac decompensation.
41) Six of 11 patients who received morethan 450 mg/m 2 of DOX did not develop signs orsymptoms of CHF. 
42) Although empiric dose restrictionis widely practiced, many patients experience theonset of CHF before they receive 550 mg/m2 ofthe drug. 
43) In nonrandomizedtrials, the use of a weekly DOX schedule hasbeen reported to permit administration of a highertotal dose of the drug. 
44) Although the data are suggestive, it remains unproventhat the antitumor activity of DOX is fullypreserved when these schedules are used.
45) The therapeutic index of an agent is defined bythe relationship between the dosage required toproduce therapeutic and toxic effects and by themagnitude of the favorable or unfavorable effectsobserved. 
46) The other studies, which did use dose limits,provided data that could confirm the reliability ofthe survival analysis method we have used toassess the dose effect relationships with regard toRNCA changes.
47) Although the numbers aresmall, in the Milan study three of five patientstreated with DOX in whom RNCA was performedshowed a decrease in LVEF of more than10% (375, 450, and 525 mg/m2). 
48) In the multidrugstudy, therapy was discontinued in sevenpatients on the DOX-containing (FAC) arm becauseof cardiac dysfunction, including threewith heart failure.
49) Thus, while assessment of LVEF byRNCA was useful in quantitating changes in cardiacfunction for the purposes of this study, itcannot be recommended for routine monitoringof individual patients as a predictor of impendingcardiac failure.
50) These findings, which are supported by theindependent work of several other investigators,provide encouragement for further clinicaltrials with EPI. 
51) This patient had shown a decrease inleft ventricular ejection fraction and was includedin the analysis of laboratory cardiac toxicity.
