Hormonal therapy produces responses in 25% to 30% of unselected patients, with median response durations in the same range. The differential responses of ER + and ER -cells to hormonal therapy has been well documented. Patients were prospectively randomized after stratification by ER content, menopausal status, dominant site of metastatic disease, and prior adjuvant chemotherapy. Patient Eligibility
18 When no ER assay was performed, the patient was designated ER unknown. Osseous disease indicated metastases in bone. Treatment
After appropriate stratification, patients were randomized to receive either chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus tamoxifen (Fig 1). Ancillary Therapy
Chemotherapy was not withheld when patients required such irradiation. 

Response Criteria
Patients were evaluated after two courses (8 weeks) of therapy. If progressive disease was evident, the patient was considered a treatment failure and taken off protocol. Comparability of Groups (Patient Characteristics): Measurable Disease
Nearly two thirds of the patients had visceral disease. Comparability of Groups (Patient Characteristics):Nonmeasurable Disease
Response 
Among 375 patients, CRs were seen in 47 (25%) of patients treated with TCAF and 34 (18%) of patients treated with CAF (Table 4). TCAF patients and 71 (37%) patients on CAF. Univariately, there were no significant differences in response rates according to menopausal status or ER status. Patients with soft tissue disease had a higher response rate than those with visceral or osseous disease (P = .05), and patients with better performance status at entry had a higher response
Among postmenopausal patients, the response rates between TCAF (62%) and CAF (53%) were not significantly different (P = .12), nor was there a significant difference in response among ER + patients to TCAF (67%) v CAF (56%); P = .22. However, among patients with soft tissue disease, TCAF produced a higher response rate than CAF (88%, 58%; P = .009). Response rates (CR and PR) for bone-only patients were significantly lower than for other patients (35% v 59%; P = .013, chi square test). If the difficulty of assessing response for the bone-only patients was taken into account, then bone-only patients were equally responsive to therapy (Table 6).

Time to treatment failure (TTF), survival, and duration of response were significantly longer for bone-only patients (Figs 2 and 3). Duration of Response, Time to Treatment Failure, Survival
Univariately, regardless of treatment (TCAF v CAF), ER positivity was significantly related to the duration of response, with ER + and ER unknown patients responding longer than ER - patients (Fig 5). There was no significant difference in duration of response by treatment (TCAF v CAF) in ER + patients. Thus, the addition of tamoxifen failed to increase response duration of ER + patients treated with CAF chemotherapy. Response rate and response duration of ER - patients treated with CAF or TCAF were not significantly different, ie, there was no detrimental effect of tamoxifen in ER - patients. 

Among ER+ patients, TTF by treatment (TCAF v CAF) did not differ significantly (P = .71). Among ER + patients, the treatments did not differ significantly (P = .45).

A secondary objective of this study was to evaluate prospectively the response of ER + v ER - tumors to CAF chemotherapy. When the 190 evaluable patients receiving CAF were analyzed by ER status (Table 7), there was no significant difference in response rate between ER + and ER - tumors (56%). However, TTF, response duration, and survival of ER + patients were significantly longer than those of ER - patients (P = .017, .0074, and .0057, respectively) (Fig 7).

Tamoxifen did not enhance the response rate, response duration or survival in ER + patients over CAF alone. Monoclonal antibody studies have demonstrated that breast cancers are heterogeneous in ER content; ie, breast cancers are composed of ER+ and ER- cells. Clearly, there is a differential response of ER + v ER - cells to hormonal therapy with at least some ER + cells responsive and ER - cells resistant. Lippman et al retrospectively analyzed 70 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with chemotherapy. ER- (< 10 fmol/mg) patients, but only three of 25 (12%) of ER + (--10 fmol/mg) cases responded (P<.0001). Kiang et al reported just the opposite; 24 of 28 ER + patients (86%) responded to chemotherapy, but only 13 of 36 (36%) ER - patients responded (P<.0001). A retrospective review of ER and response among patients on a prior CALGB study failed to show any impact of ER on response frequency." This study is the only prospectively randomized study analyzing the response of ER + v ER - patients to chemotherapy (Table 6). Our ER + and ER - cases had identical response rates (56%) to chemotherapy (CAF), but ER + patients had significantly longer response durations (P = .00015), TTF (P = .0061), and survival (P = .0058) than ER- patients (Fig 5).

Clearly, the assumption that there is a differential response of ER + v ER- patients to chemotherapy is not correct. A lack of differential response of ER + cells to chemotherapy may explain the lack of additive effect in ER + patients when chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are used concurrently.

Lastly, Kiang et al randomized 40 ER + postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer to estrogen therapy
The survival of 21 ER + patients treated with combined DES + CF was significantly longer than 19 ER + treated with DES followed by chemotherapy after relapse or treatment failure.
