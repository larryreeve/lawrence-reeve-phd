<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein to Be Kept Into Peace Process Review: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Ulster Unionist security
spokesman Ken Maginnis said Wednesday that his party does not want
Sinn Fein to be excluded from the review of the Northern Ireland
peace process even if the Irish Republican Army is found to have
broken its ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Maginnis said next month's review was "bound to indicate" Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the IRA, had not met its obligations.
</P>
<P>
Even if Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam decided the IRA
had broken its ceasefire, Maginnis said, Sinn Fein should not
"escape the inevitability" of the review.
</P>
<P>
Maginnis held an hour-long talk with Mowlam at Stormont, near
the Northern Ireland capital of Belfast Wednesday to discuss the
current political and security situation.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam said earlier this week that she would make an
announcement on whether the IRA ceasefire had been broken,
following suspicion that the IRA was involved in a recent murder
and an arms smuggling operation.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Unionist Party and UK Unionists have called for
Sinn Fein to be excluded from the political process which restarts
in September.
</P>
<P>
But the Northern Ireland security minister, Adam Ingram, said
the British government would not accept the loyalist and
republican definitions of their own ceasefires.
</P>
<P>
He said killings which could be considered "internal" to their
communities would be considered breaches of the ceasefire, if
proven.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting with Mowlam Tuesday, Sinn Fein said there was
no reason to impose sanctions on the party.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin McGuinness blamed the British
government for the failure of the political process to deliver a
devolved administration.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace process is deadlocked due to a
long-running dispute between politicians from the majority
Protestant and minority Catholic communities over guerrilla
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the Irish Republic are currently seeking ways to
revive last year's peace accord.
