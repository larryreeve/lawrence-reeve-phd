<HEADLINE> N. Irish Commission Expects IRA to Endorse Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's disarmament
commission said on Friday it expected the Irish Republican Army
will endorse the decommissioning of weapons offered by its
political wing, Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
"The Sinn Fein statement of July 1 offers the promise that
decommissioning (of weapons) by all paramilitary groups may now
begin. The commission expects that Sinn Fein's proposal will be
endorsed by the IRA and reciprocated by loyalists and other
republican paramilitary groups," General John de Chastelain,
chairman of the commission, said.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has been locked with the pro-British unionists over
the crunch issue of guerrilla disarmament and the setting up of a
power-sharing cabinet for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
De Chastelain said that the Sinn Fein statement released on
Thursday provided "the basis for believing that decommissioning
can be completed in the time prescribed by the Good Friday
Agreement."
</P>
<P>
There was still time to meet the May 2000 deadline laid out in
the Good Friday agreement reached last year, if disarmament began
soon, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein's offer to disarm the IRA was the first time for it
to accept an obligation. It vowed to work to start it within a few
months.
</P>
<P>
But the Ulster Unionists spurned the offer, saying they want a
commitment directly from the IRA.
