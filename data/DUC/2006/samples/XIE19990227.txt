<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Warns Arms Row Could Damage N.Irish Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A Sinn Fein leader warned on
Friday that pressure for IRA to disarm could cause irreparable
damage to Northern Ireland's fragile peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
wing, told BBC radio that those "who are now demanding prior
decommissioning before we move to setting up the executive are
reneging on the Good Friday Agreement."
</P>
<P>
"I think by the time those people realize that the IRA are not
going to be forced to decommission, they will have in the meantime
irreparably damaged the Good Friday Agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army (IRA) has been holding to a truce in
its war against British rule since July 1997.
</P>
<P>
But with no sign of a breakthrough on disarmament, Sinn Fein
and pro-British Unionist parties are on a collision course that
could disrupt the launch of structures agreed in last year's peace
agreement aimed at ending 30 years of strife in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Britain wants to give its province a large measure of home-rule
starting on March 10, but Protestant Unionists say they will not
sit in a ruling 10-minister executive with the Catholic Sinn Fein
unless the IRA gives up -- "decommissions" -- arms to prove that
the guerrillas' ceasefire is meant to be permanent.
