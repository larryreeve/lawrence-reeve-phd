<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Calls for Being Patient on Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
warned on Thursday that the Northern Ireland peace process will be
put in jeopardy if devolution collapses.
</P>
<P>
Adams delivered the hard-hitting statement at the opening of
new Sinn Fein offices in Newry, County Down.
</P>
<P>
He urged the unionists to "be patient and have faith" over the
issue of the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons, which is
threatening to derail the newly formed coalition government.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that any move to collapse the new political
institutions, over lack of decommissioning, would be a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no default on decommissioning," he said. "There
is no reason for the executive to collapse or for any minister to
resign."
</P>
<P>
He said a collapse of the executive or a "soft landing or
another review phase" would "create a political vacuum, reinforce
and encourage negative unionism, put the entire process into
jeopardy and make decommissioning even more difficult than it has
been so far".
</P>
<P>
Adams criticized unionists for using the arms issue as a "
political football" and claimed this had "set back" the goal of a
weapons handover.
</P>
<P>
The Sinn Fein leader also said that his party was "genuinely
committed" to resolving the arms issue but added: "It is a
fundamental mistake to try and force decommissioning by seeking to
marginalise a political party and its electorate."
</P>
<P>
Adams' comments came in the wake of speculation that the
government is drawing up plans to rush emergency legislation
through parliament to reimpose direct rule, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
This could take place if a report next Monday by General John
de Chastelain, head of the international decommissioning body
which is overseeing the process of disarmament, says there is no
advance on IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The International Commission on Decommissioning has been
meeting representatives of republican and loyalist paramilitary
organizations to discuss the handover of terrorist weapons.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair has refused to speculate in public
about what could happen and urged everyone to wait for the report.
</P>
<P>
Decommissioning is the final piece of the jigsaw of
institutions to be put in the place under the terms of the
agreement.
