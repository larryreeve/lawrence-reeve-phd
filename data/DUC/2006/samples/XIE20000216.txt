<HEADLINE> No Fresh Review of Peace Process: Sinn Fein Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 16 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
said Wednesday there could be no fresh review of the Northern
Ireland peace process unless Britain reverses the decision it made
last Friday to suspend the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of there being a review (of the peace
process)," Adams told reporters in London. "There cannot be a
review on the basis of a unilateral suspension" of the Northern
Ireland institutions by Britain, he said.
</P>
<P>
Adams, leader of the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) political
wing Sinn Fein, is due to meet British Prime Minister Tony Blair
later on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We (Sinn Fein) have no room at all to do anything in this
situation," he said, "The only breakthrough which can start to
make politics work is a return to the (Northern Ireland)
institutions."
</P>
<P>
But a Downing Street spokesman said Northern Ireland's power-
sharing bodies will not be restored unless the IRA explains how
and when it will disarm.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the IRA announced that it would end its
involvement with the international weapons decommissioning body
overseeing guerrilla disarmament in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The move appeared to be a major blow to Northern Ireland's
peace process and reflected republican anger with a British
decision last week to suspend Northern Ireland's home-rule
assembly because the IRA failed to give any clear commitment to
its disarmament.
