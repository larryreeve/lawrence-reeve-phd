<HEADLINE> N.Irish Peace Deal Within Reach: Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Irish republicans said Sunday
that a deal to revive Northern Ireland's stalled peace process was
within reach.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully tomorrow we will see, I believe, both sides have
crossed the Rubicon," Mitchel McLaughlin, chairman of Sinn Fein,
the IRA's political ally, told BBC television.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks chaired by U.S. mediator George Mitchell, which
have already lasted 10 weeks, are to resume Monday.
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin said Sinn Fein had outlined its position in great
detail to Ulster Unionist Party leaders who were relaying it to
their members over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"There will be decisions made tomorrow and hopefully it will be
positive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ken Maginnis, senior negotiator for the UUP, said Sinn Fein had
to signal that "the war is over" for progress to be made.
</P>
<P>
"There is no good in saying the guns are silent. We've had
silent guns before. They have reawakened with a tremendous clatter
and people died," he said.
</P>
<P>
Maginnis hinted that his party was willing to back off its
long-standing demand that the IRA hand in or "decommission" the
weapons it used to wage a 30-year guerrilla war against British
rule before Sinn Fein could sit in a planned coalition cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair told Sky Television from South
Africa, "I think it is a very, very critical and important
moment.... I just hope that we can make every effort in the next
few days to bring it all together."
</P>
<P>
A rescue package for the deadlocked peace process, kept tightly
under wraps, is thought to contain a series of step-by-step
gestures by all sides.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers reported over the weekend that a deal brokered by
Mitchell involved some scrapping of arms within eight weeks of the
establishment of an executive.
</P>
<P>
Another proposal is said to be that the IRA would appoint a
member to liaise with the province's disarmament commission.
</P>
<P>
Reuters quoted a report of Glasgow's Sunday Herald newspaper as
outlining five key elements for disarmament:
</P>
<P>
-- An IRA statement supporting the Sinn Fein leadership and
announcing a go-between to liaise with Canadian General John de
Chastelain, who is overseeing the decommissioning process;
</P>
<P>
-- A Sinn Fein statement condemning all political violence and
accepting that peace cannot be achieved without disarmament;
</P>
<P>
-- Nomination of proposed ministers in early December;
</P>
<P>
-- A report from de Chastelain early in the new year confirming
the IRA had appointed a negotiator and agreement on how
disarmament would be carried out;
</P>
<P>
-- A second report by the general in late January stating that
disarmament had begun.
