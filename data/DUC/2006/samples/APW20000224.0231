<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein: All Parties Must Disarm  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness said Thursday
any successful disarmament in Northern Ireland must include all parties to the
conflict, including militant Protestants who, he contended, have 150,000 weapons
at their disposal.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness expressed irritation at a news conference that the Irish
Republican Army is often cited as the cause of recent setbacks to the peace
process because it had not begun turning in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the 1998 Good Friday peace accord, which establishes the basis for
peace in the province, asserts that it is the ``collective responsibility'' of
all participants to work cooperatively to achieve decommissioning, or
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People think that the only guns that are causing problems are the guns of
the IRA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We in Sinn Fein also have concerns about guns,'' he said, referring to the
weapons held by the outlawed pro-British loyalist paramilitaries and by the
British troops deployed in the province.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, after a meeting with White House national security adviser Sandy
Berger, McGuinness said he does not feel pressure from the United States on
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This really isn't about pressure, about applying pressure,'' McGuinness
said.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness served as education secretary of the power-sharing Northern
Ireland Cabinet that was suspended by the British government Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA's unwillingness to move on the disarmament issue led Britain to
withdraw powers from the four-party coalition, which had been formed in December
under terms of the accord. The coalition took shape after the major Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists, agreed to work alongside the IRA-linked Sinn Fein
party in expectation that IRA disarmament would begin in response.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain is supposed to publish a plan for withdrawing troops and closing
army bases under terms of the peace accord. It has yet to do so, although it has
already withdrawn about 3,000 troops and closed several major bases.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness, who serves as deputy to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, is in
Washington to rally support from the White House and Irish-American leaders.
Also here are David Trimble, head of the Ulster Unionist Party, and Peter
Mandelson, the British secretary of state for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness said suspension of the local government has left him alarmed
about the future prospects for the peace process. In his appearance, he used
such phrases as ``deep crisis,'' ``dire straits, and ``huge gulf of mistrust''
to describe the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein, he said, is ``absolutely committed to making the peace process
work,'' and he cast doubt about the willingness of the Ulster Unionists to meet
Sinn Fein half way.
</P>
<P>
	   As an example, he said, ``Trimble has never been prepared to shake hands
with Gerry Adams.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also said Mandelson bears much of the responsibility for the setbacks
though his decision to suspend the local government despite what McGuinness
called Sinn Fein's ``new and significant proposal.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the British have done is totally and absolutely illegal,'' McGuinness
asserted.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble, in an appearance Wednesday at Harvard's Kennedy School, defended
the decision to suspend the government and expressed confidence that the two
sides will find a way to restore a Northern Ireland free of violence.
