<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland Coalition Is Back  </HEADLINE>

   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- As Northern Ireland's
resurrected Catholic-Protestant government got back to business
Tuesday, both sides expressed hope that the unlikely coalition will
survive on the second try.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody involved predicted smooth sailing for the four-party
Cabinet -- the central goal of the province's 1998 peace accord, and
one that has been repeatedly hamstrung by arguments over Irish
Republican Army disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting beside his IRA-linked party's two Cabinet ministers,
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said they were prepared to wage ''a
battle a day'' with Protestant colleagues and the British
government to make the system work.
</P>
<P>
   ''The difficulties haven't gone away,'' Adams said at Stormont
Parliamentary Building, the government headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   After killing 1,800 people during a 27-year campaign to abolish
Northern Ireland as a Protestant-majority British state, the
outlawed IRA has been sticking to a cease-fire since 1997. Hopes
for long-term peace here rose in December when Catholic and
Protestant politicians formed their long-delayed coalition and
Britain, which had directly ruled the province since 1972, placed
substantial responsibilities back in local hands.
</P>
<P>
   But the major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, agreed to
work alongside Sinn Fein only if the IRA responded by gradually
scrapping its hidden stockpiles of weapons. Britain suspended the
power-sharing experiment after just 11 weeks when the IRA refused
to move on disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   Then, this month, the IRA promised it would begin putting its
weapons ''beyond use'' -- a euphemism for disarmament -- if
power-sharing was resumed and seen to work. As a result, Britain
restored powers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein and the IRA ''know themselves how much rides on
this,'' said Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, the senior
Cabinet minister, who last weekend received only a bare majority of
support from his party's grass-roots council to re-enter government
with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA must begin disarming ''in good time and in a good
spirit,'' Trimble said. Otherwise, he said, ''the whole premise of
this government will be proved unsustainable once again.''
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting of the reconstituted Cabinet is scheduled for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate conflicts concern the reform of Northern
Ireland's predominantly Protestant police force, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary; whether the British flag will continue to fly over
Stormont and other government complexes; and, most crucially, when
the IRA will begin to disarm in cooperation with international
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The more hard-line Protestant party in the coalition, the
Democratic Unionists, announced late Tuesday that they would
propose that Sinn Fein be expelled from the Cabinet. Like Sinn
Fein, the Democratic Unionists are entitled to two Cabinet posts
because of their significant minority slice of votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Unionists' motion stands no chance of success,
but it would challenge Trimble's already divided deputies to unite
publicly in defense of Sinn Fein's right to hold office.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cabinet's previous abortive run, the Democratic
Unionists accepted their two posts but refused to sit in meetings
because of Sinn Fein's presence. Other parties lambasted the
Democratic Unionists as opportunists and hypocrites because they
supposedly were opposed to the entire peace accord yet accepted
power-sharing positions that come with high salaries and
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-line party now says that if Sinn Fein remains in
office, they will resign their two Cabinet posts -- but have a
rotation of party colleagues take turns filling the vacated posts
''in a holding capacity only.''
</P>
<P>
   This stunt would undermine the government's operation while
preventing other parties from taking over the posts themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The major coalition partners are the Ulster Unionists and the
province's main Catholic-supported party, the moderate Social
Democratic and Labor Party. Each have four Cabinet posts.
