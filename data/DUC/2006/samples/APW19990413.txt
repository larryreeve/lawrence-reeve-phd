<HEADLINE> Brits Warn Belfast Talks Could Fail </HEADLINE>

	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The Northern Ireland peace  
agreement will fail if the province's feuding politicians keep 
sticking selfishly to their positions, Britain's top official here 
warned today as negotiations to form a Protestant-Catholic 
government resumed. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the British and Irish prime ministers, Tony  
Blair and Bertie Ahern, published a compromise plan for forming the 
new Belfast government, the intended centerpiece of last year's 
peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Irish Republican Army and its allied Sinn Fein party  
already have rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
	Mo Mowlam, Britain's secretary of state for Northern Ireland,  
said the plan represented the two governments' best estimation of 
how to resolve the dilemma blocking progress: how to get past the 
IRA's refusal to disarm, when Protestant politicians demand 
disarmament begin before they work alongside Sinn Fein in 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The premiers' proposal called for Sinn Fein to receive its two  
allotted posts in the envisioned 12-member government -- if, in 
exchange, the IRA promised to start disarming within a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the two prime ministers' best guess as to how we  
might move forward,'' Mowlam said. ``But let us not be under any 
illusion. Any alternative must be acceptable to both traditions, 
otherwise this is not going to work. If people are only prepared to 
fight their own corner, then progress cannot be made ... and 
nothing that the prime ministers can do will help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Blair and Ahern said they might get directly  
involved again in the Belfast negotiations, possibly Thursday, but 
only if the key local parties inched closer together. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists,  
emphasized following an internal policy-making meeting Monday that 
they considered the Ahern-Blair formula ``a basis for 
negotiation,'' particularly since it emphasized the IRA's 
``obligation'' to disarm. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sinn Fein today accused Ahern, Blair and the Ulster  
Unionists of trying to rewrite the April 1998 landmark accord, 
which specified no date when disarmament must start, only that it 
should finish by May 2000. It also did not explicitly tie 
disarmament to Sinn Fein's eligibility for office. 
</P>
<P>
	The major Catholic-supported party, the Social Democratic and  
Labor Party, has also criticized Sinn Fein and the IRA for 
receiving benefits from the agreement, such as paroles for IRA 
prisoners, but delivering nothing new in return. 
</P>
<P>
	The SDLP, however, is loath to sanction what the Ulster  
Unionists have repeatedly sought -- to form a government that 
excludes Sinn Fein and leaves all Catholic representation in 
moderate SDLP hands.
