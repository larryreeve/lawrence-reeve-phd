<HEADLINE> Brits, Irish Studies Report on IRA  </HEADLINE>

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The British and Irish governments early
today studied a long-awaited report by a disarmament commission looking into
whether the Irish Republican Army is finally willing to reveal its network of
arms dumps.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither government would reveal details of the report, which they received
just before midnight Monday. That was the deadline set by American mediator
George Mitchell as part of his successful mission last year to rescue Northern
Ireland's Good Friday peace accord of 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   But Catholic and Protestant politicians in the province's 8-week-old Cabinet
fear that the report will confirm that the IRA has not yet begun to disarm, and
that this in turn will force the British government to suspend the local
administration's powers and resume so-called ``direct rule'' from London.
</P>
<P>
	   The compromise package brokered by Mitchell required the major Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists, to form a Cabinet that included the IRA-linked Sinn
Fein party in advance of any IRA disarmament. In exchange, the IRA was supposed
to cooperate with the disarmament commission and negotiate the gradual
destruction of its hidden weapons stores.
</P>
<P>
	   While IRA commanders have been discussing the prospect in secret with the
disarmament commission's head, Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain, his report will
indicate whether the outlawed group has made any concrete commitments.
</P>
<P>
	   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, who so far has faced down substantial
Protestant opposition to including Sinn Fein in power-sharing arrangements, says
his party can't sustain the administration if the IRA doesn't reciprocate.
</P>
<P>
	   He expects the British government to suspend the administration's powers in
advance of an Ulster Unionist meeting Feb. 12. Trimble scheduled that meeting as
a reassurance to party activists skeptical that the IRA would disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   A suspension of powers would allow the four-party, 12-member Cabinet to be
mothballed pending a breakthrough in the IRA arms impasse.
</P>
<P>
	   But both Sinn Fein and the province's major Catholic-supported party, the
moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party, warned that any suspension of
authority could lead to the Cabinet's eventual collapse and would only make IRA
disarmament tougher to achieve.
</P>
<P>
	   The Good Friday accord anticipated that Northern Ireland would receive a new
cross-community government by late 1998, and that the IRA would completely
disarm by May. But the Ulster Unionists delayed forming the Cabinet for more
than a year, arguing that Sinn Fein's eligibility to hold office should depend
on a start to IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble received just 58 percent support for moderating that policy in a
ballot of the Ulster Unionists' grassroots council. That November result was
deemed sufficient for him to enter a Cabinet alongside Sinn Fein -- but too
little for him to stay there for long if the IRA doesn't begin disarming.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams has countered that the accord only obliges his
party to attempt to persuade IRA commanders to disarm. He stresses there's no
guarantee -- given the many broken deadlines already experienced on Northern
Ireland's slow road to peace -- that the IRA will discard even a single bullet
by May.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA started a campaign of bombing and shooting in 1970 in hopes of
abolishing Northern Ireland as a Protestant-majority state linked to Britain. It
called a cease-fire in 1997 after slaying more than 1,800 people. The gesture,
though short of a formal renunciation of violence, cleared the way for Sinn Fein
to join multiparty talks that produced the Good Friday pact.
