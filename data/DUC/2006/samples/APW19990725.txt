<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Rules Out Disarmament </HEADLINE>

	LONDON (AP) -- Sinn Fein, the Irish Republican Army's political  
ally, on Sunday ruled out IRA disarmament by May, dealing another 
blow to the shaky prospects of implementing last year's peace 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Implementation of the peace accord in this British province is  
stalled over the outlawed IRA's refusal to hand over any of its 
weapons. The main Protestant politicians, the Ulster Unionists, 
have refused to sit in a Cabinet with Sinn Fein while the IRA 
remains armed. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties last week missed a third deadline for forming a  
Protestant-Catholic coalition Cabinet envisaged in the peace 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The British and Irish prime ministers, Tony Blair and Bertie  
Ahern, then persuaded former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell, the 
architect of the accord signed on Good Friday last year, to again 
help with negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The accord does not specify that the IRA must start disarming  
before Sinn Fein can hold Cabinet positions. It says, however, that 
the IRA and pro-British Protestant paramilitary organizations must 
surrender all weapons by May 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell hopes to break the deadlock with what Blair calls a  
``review'' of the accord, which will begin Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinn Fein leaders said Saturday after a preliminary meeting with  
Mitchell that they would deliver a ``considered assessment'' of the 
state of the peace process later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell has said he believes the agreement can still be made to  
work -- despite gloomy signals from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Wednesday, after the second anniversary of its  
latest cease-fire, the IRA blamed the British government for the 
failure to implement the accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRA also noted that it broke its previous cease-fire with a  
massive London bombing in 1996 following demands for disarmament. 
</P>
<P>
	David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, described the  
statement as ``rather menacing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Sinn Fein's Doherty reiterated the position held by  
his party and the IRA that the accord is in trouble because the 
Cabinet has not been formed. 
</P>
<P>
	Disarmament, he said, ``has to be in the political context, and  
there is no political context at the moment.''
