<HEADLINE> N.Ireland's First Minister Insists on IRA Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's First Minister
David Trimble said on Tuesday he would refuse to set up a
power-sharing executive until the IRA began to disarm.
</P>
<P>
"No guns -- no government," said Trimble, underlining that
there would be no change to his long-held demand that the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) must disarm before its Sinn Fein political
wing could join the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Trimble, also leader of the largest Protestant party Ulster
Unionist Party (UUP), told reporters in Belfast he had held talks
with senior members of his party and they had decided the party
needed clarification of the proposals put forward by the British
government last week.
</P>
<P>
The proposals commit Sinn Fein to strive to achieve disarmament
by May 2000, but do not specify that arms must be shed before Sinn
Fein enters the executive.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he hoped the matter would be resolved
satisfactorily but it would take some time.
</P>
<P>
A British government spokesman said Prime Minister Tony Blair
would hold talks in London on Wednesday with Trimble and Sinn Fein
leader Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
Blair, anxious to get the peace process moving again, said on
Saturday he had set June 30 as an "absolute" deadline for the
launch of a power-sharing executive to run the province -- a key
part of the Good Friday accord.
</P>
<P>
IRA's political wing Sinn Fein has accepted the proposals that
emerged last Friday.
