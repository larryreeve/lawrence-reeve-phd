LONDON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Wednesday welcomed Sinn Fein's decision to disarmament,
saying it was proof that the Northern Ireland peace process was
moving in the right direction.
</P>

Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, appointed its chief
negotiator Martin McGuinness on Wednesday as go-between for the
IRA and the independent body on arms decommissioning charged with
overseeing the scrapping of weapons by Northern Ireland's
guerrilla groups.

<P>
Blair's official spokesman said the prime minister believed
"the peace process is moving in the right direction,"

<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said in a statement that all
participants in the peace agreement must now act with renewed
commitment to all its terms and remove all guns from the
paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.

"This statement by Gerry Adams is an important practical step
in that process. It underlines the determination of the
signatories to the Good Friday agreement to fulfil all their
obligations," Blair's spokesman said.

<P>
The Northern Ireland peace agreement, signed in April, "must be
implemented as a whole and that includes decommissioning of
weapons by all paramilitary organizations within the time scale
laid out," he added.
