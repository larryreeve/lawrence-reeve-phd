<HEADLINE> N. Irish Sinn Fein Invites Unionists to Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland republican leader
Gerry Adams on Thursday invited leaders of the province's main pro-
British party to talks in a bid to restart the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a statement, Adams said his Sinn Fein party, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army, was offering to hold
a "substantive round of discussions" with the Protestant Ulster
Unionist Party in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We are seeking a range of meetings with the UUP at various
levels, both formal and informal, in a concerted attempt to find
the way forward in order to facilitate these discussions," Adams
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to conduct these meetings in private," Adams
said.
</P>
<P>
Talks held earlier this summer involving both sides in Northern
Ireland and the British and Irish governments failed to break a
deadlock between Sinn Fein republicans and the unionists over
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Adams said Sinn Fein had not decided whether to take part in a
review of the Northern Ireland peace process to be headed by U.S.
Senator George Mitchell in September, which represented another
attempt to end the stalemate.
