<HEADLINE> N.Irish Leaders Make No Progress in New Round of Talks </HEADLINE>

LONDON, October 1 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's main political
party leaders on Friday completed a second round-table session
chaired by U.S. mediator George Mitchell but made no progress over
guerrilla disarmament.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of the pro-British Ulster Unionist Party
(UUP), said in Belfast that no progress had been made in the
discussions with Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which will resume on Monday in Belfast, are part of
a drive by Mitchell to broker a compromise between Sinn Fein and
Trimble's party.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time the Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and UUP
leader David Trimble have met since July as part of the review.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's review was sparked by the collapse of talks at
Stormont, Belfast in July, following the Ulster Unionists' refusal
to sit in government with Sinn Fein until the IRA begins to
decommission its weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein says that is a precondition which was not in the Good
Friday Agreement.
