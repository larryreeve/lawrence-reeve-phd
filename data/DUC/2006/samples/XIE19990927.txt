LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's leading
pro-British unionists and pro-Irish republicans were back in the
province on Sunday after separate sessions to decide how to
progress with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army,
held a two-day "think-tank" seminar across the border in Donegal,
in the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, it set up a committee to examine the findings of a
controversial report on policing in the British-ruled province,
the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein also discussed the ongoing peace talks chaired by
former U.S. senator George Mitchell at the seminar, which was
attended by party leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Sinn Fein vice-president Pat Doherty said
republicans wanted to work with the UUP "in partnership" to
achieve the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist Party, led by David Trimble,
also held a meeting over the weekend in a hotel at Glasgow airport
in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held to plan the UUP's participation in the
Mitchell talks and to discuss whether the peace process deadlock,
over IRA disarmament, could be broken.
</P>
<P>
According to some newspapers, during the weekend strategy
meeting in Glasgow, the party's assembly group considered a
proposal to share power with Sinn Fein ahead of IRA
decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
But as UUP assembly members returned from Scotland, south
Tyrone MP Ken Maginnis insisted there would be no change in policy
without the backing of the party officials and the 110-member
executive.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the Good Friday agreement, the UUP has
insisted it would not form an executive that included Sinn Fein
without the handover of at least some IRA weapons.
</P>
<P>
Reports had suggested the UUP assembly team was considering
several approaches to the decommissioning and devolution deadlock
blocking the formation of a multi-party executive in Northern
Ireland.
