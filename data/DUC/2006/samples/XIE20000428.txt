<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Says IRA Weapons Rethink Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein chairman Mitchell
McLaughlin said Friday that the Irish Republican Army will never
hand over its weapons while the present approach to
decommissioning remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
He made the comments following an announcement by British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern that
they were to hold further talks with Northern Ireland's political
parties.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish prime ministers will meet the Ulster
Unionists, Social Democratic and Labour Party and Sinn Fein at
Downing Street on May 2.
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed Blair's visit to Northern Ireland last
week, during which he met all of the parties to try to gain a
sense of whether there could be agreement on a way to get the
peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
British and Irish officials have been working to try to find
some plan to move the process forward, in the absence of all-party
meetings in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
But the impasse between unionists and republicans over the IRA'
s refusal to decommission and under what circumstances the
suspended power-sharing government could be reinstated remains
unbroken.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist Leader David Trimble has said there must be"
action" on IRA decommissioning if he is to go back into government
with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
But McLaughlin repeated his party's position: Sinn Fein was
working to remove guns from society but could give no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
He said if there was to be progress there must be fresh
thinking on the arms issue.
</P>
<P>
"There are no guarantees for Sinn Fein. There are no guarantees
for anybody else, but there is this certainty, that if we maintain
the present approach on IRA disarmament, there will never be IRA
disarmament," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Sinn Fein's view, which we have restated over and over again,
is that we have already taken valuable steps in the direction of
removing all of the guns," he added.
