LONDON, April 23 (Xinhua) - Sinn Fein has urged Britain to act
to save Northern Ireland's stalled peace process as thousands of
Irish republicans marched Sunday to mark the 1916 Easter rising
against British rule.

<P>
Addressing hundreds of supporters at a commemoration in Dublin,
one of a series of gatherings north and south of the border. Sinn
Fein's chief negotiator Martin mcGuinness said: "It is still not
too late to save the Good Friday Agreement."
</P>
<P>
"If the Good Friday Agreement is to be saved it is up to Tony
Blair and his government...The key to the future is in his hand,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has stalled over the lack of progress on
disarmament by Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas, which led
Britain to suspend the power-sharing assembly in Northern Ireland
in February.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political ally, called for an end to
demands for what it termed an IRA surrender as a pre-condition for
restoring home rule.
</P>
<P>
"This farce of demanding IRA surrender must stop,"McGuinness
said in a speech at Dublin's Glasnevin cemetery where a number of
prominent republicans are buried.
</P>
<P>
"If all the guns are to be taken out of Irish politics, and
that is an honorable objective, then the only way to do it is to
prove that politics work, and that politics are allowed to work,"
he added.
