<HEADLINE> IRA Says It Will Not Disarm  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The Irish Republican Army said Saturday it
will not disarm in response to British government or Protestant demands -- and
emphasized that it had never pledged to give up its arms at all.
</P>
<P>
	   The outlawed group's statement left the centerpiece of Northern Ireland's
peace accord, the Protestant-Catholic government, in continued peril.
</P>
<P>
	   The British government says it intends to strip the 9-week-old coalition
Cabinet of its powers on Friday if the IRA doesn't promise to disarm. The IRA's
response Saturday fell far short of that, mixing optimistic-sounding rhetoric
with a determination to resist political pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   In its statement, the IRA emphasized its willingness to ``support efforts to
secure the resolution of the arms issue.'' But it didn't directly say whether it
would begin scrapping its weapons dumps in cooperation with a disarmament
commission, as the 1998 Good Friday peace accord envisaged.
</P>
<P>
	   Any solution ``will not be on British or (Protestant) unionist terms, nor
will it be advanced by British legislative threats,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA statement came as Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-linked Sinn Fein
party, met with David Trimble, who leads Northern Ireland's major Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists, and holds the top post in the four-party Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither leader would discuss the content of their meeting, which lasted only
minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   But Trimble said the IRA statement had nothing new to say and was ``most
unfortunate.'' Adams said it reflected anger over the British government's
``threat and ultimatum.''
</P>
<P>
	   The province's Cabinet was formed two months ago following a Sinn
Fein-Ulster Unionist deal brokered by American mediator George Mitchell. The
Ulster Unionists agreed to form a Cabinet with Sinn Fein. But in exchange, the
Ulster Unionists expected the IRA to begin disarming in January.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRA then opened discussions with the province's long-stymied disarmament
commission. But the commission reported Jan. 31 that its talks with IRA leaders
had produced no concrete gains, triggering an Ulster Unionist threat to withdraw
from the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   The British government's first priority is to discourage Trimble and his
colleagues from resigning. With Protestant opinion split down the middle on the
merits of sharing power with Sinn Fein, the Ulster Unionists might not have
sufficient support to win re-election if they resign. That would make it
impossible to start the Cabinet up again.
</P>
<P>
	   Rendering the Cabinet powerless but intact would avoid that scenario. It
would allow for powers to be returned from London to Belfast if the deadlock is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   But to rising British and Ulster Unionist annoyance, the Sinn Fein-IRA
movement insists it isn't violating the letter of the Good Friday accord.
</P>
<P>
	   The accord required Sinn Fein leaders -- among them prominent ex-IRA figures
-- to use ``whatever influence they may have'' to try to achieve IRA disarmament
by May 2000. As an outlawed group, the IRA couldn't be directly represented in
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The IRA has never entered into any agreement, undertaking or understanding
at any time with anyone on any aspect of decommissioning. We have not broken our
commitment or betrayed anyone,'' the IRA said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cabinet's senior Catholic politician, Seamus Mallon, said Saturday that
the Sinn Fein-IRA position is deliberately misleading.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein and the IRA are wrong to characterize disarmament as ``some
amorphous thing that somehow or another was an addendum to the Good Friday
agreement. It isn't,'' said Mallon, deputy leader of the main Catholic-supported
party, the moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party. ``It's central to it.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the vast majority of people in Ireland expected the IRA ``to answer
two questions: Will it disarm? And if so, when?''
