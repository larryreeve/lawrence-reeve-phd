	LONDON (AP) -- The British and Irish prime ministers tried in  
vain today to get Northern Ireland's rival political leaders to 
form a Protestant-Catholic government and keep the peace accord 
afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians from three key parties left London unable to agree  
on a way to form a government, the centerpiece of the 1998 Belfast 
accord aimed at stopping three decades of bloodshed in the 
British-ruled province. 
</P>
<P>
	They did agree, however, to meet again next week at the London  
office of British Prime Minister Tony Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, insisted  
that the Irish Republican Army promise to disarm before his 
Protestant supporters would join a government that includes the 
IRA-linked Sinn Fein party. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern  
proposed a compromise plan after round-the-clock negotiations in 
Northern Ireland: Sinn Fein would receive its two positions in the 
envisioned 12-member government, but only if the IRA promised to 
destroy a cache of weapons within a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ulster Unionists and the major Catholic party, the moderate  
Social Democratic and Labor Party, or SDLP, both supported the 
approach. But Sinn Fein rejected it, prompting Monday's 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair and Ahern devoted most time to the six-member Sinn Fein  
delegation, spending the last hour talking exclusively with party 
leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men have been identified as senior IRA commanders in the  
1970s, when the outlawed group's now-suspended campaign to break 
Northern Ireland's links with Britain was at its bloodiest. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin accused both  
governments of deliberately misinterpreting the peace agreement to 
suit Ulster Unionist demands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The two governments keep pressing Sinn Fein for things which  
we simply cannot deliver,'' said McLaughlin, who emphasized that 
the accord specified only that Sinn Fein should use its influence 
with the IRA to achieve disarmament by May 2000. He said the accord 
``is in free fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ahern, who said he had spent 30 hours over the weekend talking  
with Northern Irish politicians by phone, testily rejected Sinn 
Fein's assertion that the agreement was collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein, Ahern said,  
``I'm not asking anyone to concede totally on their position. I'm 
asking both parties to try and assist us in developing a 
compromise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seamus Mallon, a SDLP leader who would be Trimble's deputy in  
the new government, accused both parties of maintaining positions 
that could ``destroy something which can create a totally new way 
of life for all of us.''
