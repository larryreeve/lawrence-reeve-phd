<HEADLINE> Blair Tries to Sell Peace Plan to Protestant Unionists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Monday tried to persuade Protestant Unionists into accepting his
new peace plan, saying that a Northern Ireland government could be
formed without Sinn Fein if the Irish Republican Army fails to
disarm.
</P>
<P>
"If at any point in time, including after the first few days,
the IRA and (its political wing) Sinn Fein do not hold to the
commitments they have given, then the process is simply unwound,"
he told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
Protestant leaders have resisted pressure from London and
Dublin to agree to proposals under which they would sit with the
republican Sinn Fein party in a new provincial executive in
exchange for a pledge, but no proof, that IRA guerrillas would
give up their arms by next May.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish governments put forward the proposals
last week in a bid to break the deadlock over guerrilla
disarmament which has jeopardized last year's Good Friday peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
The Protestant Unionists, who back British rule, have accused
Blair of making too many concessions to the Catholics, who wanted
to link up with the Irish Republic. But Blair insisted there were
what he called "fail-safe" guarantees built into the blueprint for
peace.
</P>
<P>
"If the words aren't followed by actions...then the fail-safe
operates and we rewind the process with it being absolutely clear
that Sinn Fein go out of the executive. And if the other parties
can agree, then they can move forward together," Reuters quoted
him as saying. "It will be absolutely clear that the defaulting
party is Sinn Fein."
</P>
<P>
Blair, who is expected to make a statement to parliament on
Monday on the faltering drive for peace, pointed out that IRA
guarantees will have to be made to the independent commission set
up to oversee disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"They have to give to the independent commission a clear and
unambiguous statement, not just that the war is over, but that
they intend to decommission their weapons," he said.
