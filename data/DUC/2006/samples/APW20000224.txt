<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein: All Parties Must Disarm  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sinn Fein leader Martin McGuinness said Thursday any
successful disarmament in Northern Ireland must include all parties to the
conflict, including Unionists who, he contended, have 150,000 weapons at their
disposal.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness expressed irritation at a news conference that the Irish
Republican Army is often cited as the cause of recent setbacks to the peace
process because it had not begun turning in its weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the 1998 Good Friday Accords, which established the basis for peace
in the province, assert that it is the ``collective responsibility'' of all
participants to work cooperatively to achieve decommissioning, or disarmament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People think that the only guns that are causing problems are the guns of
the IRA,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We in Sinn Fein also have concerns about guns,'' he said, referring to the
weapons held by the Unionists and the British troops deployed in the province.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness served as education secretary of the local government in Northern
Ireland that was suspended by the British government two weeks ago because of
the disarmament issue.
</P>
<P>
	   The government, which featured participation by the main Protestant parties
and Sinn Fein, lasted just eight weeks before it was dissolved by the British
government.
</P>
<P>
	   McGuinness, who serves as deputy to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, is here to
rally support from the White House and Irish-American leaders. Also here are
David Trimble, the Protestant Unionist leader, and Peter Mandelson, the British
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   The dissolution of the local government has left McGuinness alarmed about
the future prospects for the peace process. In his appearance, he used such
phrases as ``deep crisis,'' ``dire straits, and ``huge gulf of mistrust'' to
described the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Sinn Fein is ``absolutely committed to making the peace process
work,'' and he cast doubt about the willingness of Unionists to meet Sinn Fein
half way.
</P>
<P>
	   As an example, he said, ``Trimble has never been prepared to shake hands
with Gerry Adams.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also said Mandelson bears much of the responsibility for the setbacks
though his decision to dissolve the local government despite Sinn Fein's
``having brought forth a new and significant proposal.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the British have done is totally and absolutely illegal,'' McGuinness
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trimble, in an appearance Wednesday at Harvard's Kennedy School, defended
the decision to suspend home rule and expressed confidence that the two sides
will find a way to restore a Northern Ireland free of violence.
