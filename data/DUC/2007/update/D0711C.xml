    LOS ANGELES, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Business seemed as usual at Microsoft headquarters on first day of U.S. government's antitrust trial against this software giant.
    On Monday in Washington D.C., federal government and 20 states kicked off trial that accused Microsoft of illegal activities, including bullying competitors.
    He asserted that Microsoft repeatedly offered IBM better terms and prices for Windows if it favored Microsoft products ranging from so-called office productivity applications to its Internet browsing software.
    Much of detailed, company-by-company information on prices to makers for Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system was submitted in previous testimony.

    As a result, on Friday evening Microsoft faxed a several-page settlement offer to Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general who are suing Microsoft.
    Fierce competition is one thing, government says, but voluminous record including volumes of e-mail, internal Microsoft documents and witness testimony show Microsoft to have been an arm-twisting monopolist, whose corporate behavior stifled competition and harmed consumers.
    Some antitrust experts say Lessig brief may give Jackson legal blueprint he needs for concluding that Microsoft did violate tying law.
    Klein saw another reason to hold up Microsoft case as an example.

    Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said immediately after ruling that, as expected, company would appeal.
    The government says that splitting Microsoft would prevent Windows system, that runs on over 80 percent of personal computers, from being used to force companies and consumers to use other Microsoft products.
    The company's appeal could bypass normal appeals court process and go straight to Supreme Court under a mechanism available in major antitrust cases.
    Several of legal experts said Thursday that they saw little support for Microsoft's suggestion that judge was relying on antitrust concepts that are out of step with fast-moving computer business.
