    BONN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Private investors are set to benefit from 1999 introduction of single European currency, euro, thanks to expanded investment opportunities, reduced currency risks, and rising competitions, German central bank Bundesbank said Monday.
    Moreover, investors are also set to benefit from reduced transaction costs and improved market transparency resulting from heated competitions among financial institutions after advent of euro, Bundesbank said.
    The European Union member states are required to completely replace their own national currencies with Euro from January 1, 2002.

    BANGKOK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is considering using European single currency, euro, in country's foreign reserves, Nation reported Tuesday.
    A special task force will study impact of euro on country's official reserves in a bid to help stem volatility of U.S. dollar and Japanese yen.
    However, arrival of euro is likely to reduce Thailand's trading volume with other countries significantly, official said.
    The total cost of introducing euro is estimated to be at 1 to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product of 11 euro countries.

    "Romania's Central Bank (BNR) and country's commercial banks fear little about introduction of euro and will easily adapt to it," BNR Foreign Currency Director George Mucibabici told a recent colloquium on euro in Bucharest.
    BNR and Romanian commercial banks that want to perform euro services will have to open accounts in euro by January 4, 1999, first scheduled day of euro use, and inform their foreign partners.
    BNR indicative exchange rates will be modified to include euro instead of current European single currency, ECU.
    The daily exchange rates released by central bank would include single currency, too, he said.
