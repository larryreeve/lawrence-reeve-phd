    The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, April 6: Russell Henderson's decision to plead guilty to kidnapping and murder of Matthew Shepard is little consolation to Shepard family, but it provides an appropriately severe sentence for one whose apparent anti-gay hatred led him to destroy a young life.
    ``Aaron McKinney, he pulled out a gun and told Matthew Shepard to give him his wallet,'' continued Henderson, who said that while he drove his friend beat Shepard.
    The stress on Shepard family was so great, she continued, that within a month of Matthew's funeral, his paternal grandfather died.

    Henderson pleaded guilty to murder this spring to avoid a death penalty.
    Shepard's mother, Judy, sat with several friends opposite several of McKinney's relatives, including his father, Bill McKinney.
    Rerucha presented a chronology for night of Oct. 6, 1998, from Fireside Lounge, where McKinney and Henderson encountered Shepard, to beatings, which began as two drove Shepard around town and continued at fence.
    As a result, Tangeman told jury, McKinney ``becomes very, very upset and beats Matthew Shepard,'' prompted by memories of a sexual encounter forced upon him by an older boy when he was 7.

    The prosecution had originally asked for death penalty for Aaron McKinney, 22, for killing Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old college student, but later Shepard's parents agreed to spare him from lethal injection.
    The play ultimately questions whether Laramie, or nation, has changed as a result.
    In an interview, he said Shepard murder had changed some attitudes in Laramie, including those of friends of his who no longer use word ``fag'' to describe a gay man.
    ``After Matthew Shepard incident, there was a push for understanding, like we're going to face what happened in our community and we're going to change.''
