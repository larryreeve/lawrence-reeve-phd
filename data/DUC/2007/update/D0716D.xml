    The Age -- Australian conservationists and traditional aboriginal owners threatened to blockade development of huge Jabiluka uranium mine in country's vast Kakadu National Park, which is on World Heritage List, after federal government approved mining plan for Jabilika mine yesterday.
    Resources Minister Warwick Parer said estimates indicated Jabiluka mine contains about 19.5 million tons of ore, which could provide more than 90,400 tons of uranium oxide.
    "Jabiluka means Australia could become leading world uranium oxide supplier," Parer said in a statement.

    CANBERRA, November 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia faces international embarrassment over Jabiluka uranium mine, with a U.N. committee Wednesday demanding mine be scrapped to prevent it endangering surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area.
    "The mission has concluded that Kakadu National Park is exposed to a number of serious threats which are placing it under both ascertained and potential danger," bureau said in a report after it sent a mission to Australia to examine claims by conservation groups that Kakadu (National Park in Northern Territory) was under threat from Jabiluka.

  <UPDATE DOCSUBSET="D0716D-C">
    The Australian: -- The Australian government's environmental report on Jabiluka uranium mine (located in Kakadu Natural Park), to be released Thursday, found area is not under threat and attacked a UNESCO report that said Kakadu Natural Park was in danger.
    Hill said Australia's response to report "clearly demonstrated that there is no basis to including Kakadu National Park on in-danger list".
    The findings of mission report were inconsistent with fact Ranger uranium mine, less than 20 km from Jabiluka had operated for 20 years with no adverse impact on Kakadu.
