Three hundred eleven patients with primary operable carcinoma of the breast were entered in a surgical and adjunctive chemotherapy trial in Alabama between 1975 and 1978. A total of 91 surgeons participated (all Diplomats of the American Board of Surgery and Members of the American College of Surgeons). All operative reports, pathology and therapy were reviewed by referees. Histologically node positive patients were randomized after operation to receive melphalan or C.M.F.(cytoxan, methotrexate, and 5-FU) for 1 year. After a median follow-up of 5.5 years, there was no significant difference in disease-free survival or in overall survival between the two groups. There was a trend toward improved 5-year survival rates in the radical mastectomy group compared to the modified radical mastectomy group (84% vs. 76%, p = 0.14). There was also an increased incidence of local wound recurrence in those patients receiving modified radical mastectomy, but the differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.09). Longer follow-up will be necessary to evaluate these results more fully</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1090"><COL><DATA></DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1091"><COL><DATA></DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1092"><COL><DATA></DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1093"><COL><DATA></DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="8"><COL><DATA> A controlled evaluation of a single-layer everting technique of suture versus a conventional two-layer inverting technique has been attempted in clinical large-bowel surgery.  Thirty-five patients suffering from carcinoma or other diseases of the large intestine were allocated randomly to each technique in the conduct of various forms of coionic resection with anastomosis or closure of a transverse colostomy.  There were 3 operative deaths after everting suture and 1 after inverting suture, all attributable mainly to anastomotic failure. A higher proportion of patients developed  wound  infection  or  peritonitis  after everting than inverting suture-51 as against 35 percent.  Overt faecal fistulation was observed in no less than 43 per cent of the patients having evertingsuture, but in only 8-6 per cent of those treated by inverting suture. Late stricture formation was noted in 2 cases after everting suture, but in none after inverting suture.These experiences are considered to provide a clear condemnation of the use of an everting technique of suture in the large intestinein clinical practice.</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="264"><COL><DATA></DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1206"><COL><DATA> Adenocarcinoma/Adult/Aged/Comparative Study/Female/Human/Lymphatic Metastasis/Male/Middle Age/Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/pathology/Prospective Studies/Radiotherapy/Rectal Neoplasms/Rectum/Sex Factors/Sigmoid Neoplasms/surgery/United States</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="239"><COL><DATA> A combined intraoperative and postoperative adjuvant program of 5 minus Fluorouracil (5 FU) for patients undergoing &quot;curative&quot; resection for adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum was initiated as a randomized clinical trial in January 1968. Patients at the Medical College of Virginia and the University of Virginia were randomly assigned to an intraluminal 5 FU or intraluminal control (Saline) group and were so treated at the time of surgical resection if findings at operation indicated that all gross neoplastic disease could be resected. Patients with operative findings denoting incurability were eliminated from the study after surgical exploration. Those patients receiving intraluminal 5 FU (30mg/kg) received intravenous 5 FU (10mg/kg) on each of the two first postoperative days and 5 subsequent postoperative courses of oral 5FU (90 mg/kg in each 18 day course) over a one year period. By December 31, 1973 (6 years) 156 patients undergoing &quot;curative&quot; resection were entered into the study. SU therapy with the control or &quot;No Treat&quot; group reveal no significant benefit from this intensive adjuvant course of 5 FU thus far. Continued assessment of these patient groups and their subgroups will be required to develop confidence in these findings but the data thus far suggest no potential benefit from this particular adjuvant program</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="274"><COL><DATA> This radomized double-blind study was designed to compare the therapeutic effectiveness of the oral and i.v. routes for 5-FU administered in intensive courses to 100 patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the large bowel, treated to equivalent levels of toxicity. An oral dose of 20 mg/kg day times 5 was found to produce comparable G.I., mucocutaneous, and hematologic side effects to a dose of 13.5 mg/kg day times 5 by rapid i.v. injection. Courses were repeated at 5 weeks. Nine of 47, or 19.1%, treated by the oral route have shown objective response, compared to 14 of 53, or 26%, treated by the i.v. route. If malignant hepatomegaly is considered alone, the response rates are 8 of 23, or 34.8%, by the oral route, and 7 of 22, or 31.8%, by the i.v. route. The mean duration of response for the oral group, 11.1 weeks, was shorter than for the i.v. route, 20 weeks, a statistically significant (p less than 0.02) difference. Serial serum 5-FU levels after two doses of 5-FU were determined by microbiological assay in 19 patients. For i.v. administration the curves were comparable among different patients as well as in the same patient. There was striking variability, however, for oral administration</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="280"><COL><DATA> In a prospective randomized trial, 700 patients with a confirmed histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the rectum or rectosigmoid were randomized to receive radiotherapy prior to operation (2000 to 2500 rads in two weeks) or surgery alone. Five year observed survival in the 453 patients on whom &quot;curative&quot; resection was possible was 48.5% in the X-ray treated group compared with 38.8% in controls, while in the 305 having low lying lesions requiring abdominoperineal resection, survival in the treated group was 46.9% compared with 34.3% in controls. Although suggestive of a treatment benefit, neither is considered statistically significant. Histologically positive lymph nodes were found in 41.2% of the control group and in only 27.8% of the patients receiving radiotherapy. Reveiw of all patients who died during the study shows a consistently lower death rate from cancer in the radiotherapy group. Although this study suggests a treatment benefit from preoperative radiotherapy, further studies now in progress by this group and others are necessary to determine the optimal dose regimen</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="306"><COL><DATA> In a randomized, controlled study of 80 patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma, the combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), methyl-1, 3-cis(2-chlorethyl)-1-nitrosourea, and vincristine produced an overall degree to toxicity comparable to that of 5-FU used alone.

This report analyzes the data in 700 patients, all at 5-year risk. There appears to be a definate benefit to irradiated patients who undergo abdominoperineal resections, when compared with the controls. This advantage is reflected in improvement of 5-year survival, and reduction in lymph node invasion, local recurrence, and distant metastases. A second protocol has been initiated in 30 VA hospitals employing a higher dose (3150 rads) to extended portals (toL2) to male patients who require abdominoperineal resections</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="319"><COL><DATA> In a randomized series of 70 patients with colo rectal adenocarcinoma, a comparison of systemic 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy administered as a continuous 120-hours infusion vs. intravenous bolus injection daily for 5 days demonstrated superiority of prolonged intravenous infusion. The most striking advantage of prolonged infusion of 5-FU was the absence of myelotoxicity. Fifteen of the 34 patients treated with infusion and 8 of the 36 patients treated by bolus injection developed objective tumor responses. The difference in response rate at least in part is explainable by unequal distribution of patients with different characteristics between the two treatment groups</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="574"><COL><DATA> The results are presented of a five-year prospective trial of 411 patients with breast carcinoma treated by mastectomy and post-operative radiotherapy. Twice or thrice weekly dose-fractionation techniques were used, i.e. 12 fractions in 28 days and six fractions in 18 days. The results show that, in terms of survival and control of local disease, the two techniques are very similar. The early and late radiation effects on the normal tissues up to five years are similar and acceptable. Dose levels thought to be biologically equivalent on the basis of experience at St Thomas&apos;s Hosiptal were selected. It is stressed that there is a narrower margin of normal tissue tolerance when six fractions over 18 days are used, that it is essential to treat all fields on each treatment occasion and that the total maximum tissue dose of 3600 R is not exceeded. Attention is drawn to the fact that the dose for six fractions, derived from the NSD formula which would be predicted to be equivalent to the 12-fraction dose is, in fact, over 10% higher than the dose used here and likely to produce unacceptable late radiation changes</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="599"><COL><DATA> In 1958, a co-operative clinical trial, involving 23 institutions, was begun to evaluate the efficacy of a short course of triethylenethiophosphoramide as an adjuvant to radical mastectomy in the treatment of patients with primary carcinoma of the breast. Of 826 women prospectively randomized so that they received either a placebo or triethylenethiophosphoramide, 99.3 per cent were available for five years of follow-up study, and 95.3 per cent have been observed for ten or more years. Results have indicated the inadequacy of standard operative therapy in effecting a permanent tumor-free state in a majority of patients. Particularly distressing was the finding that 76 per cent of all patients with positive axillary nodes--65 per cent with one to three and 86 per cent of those with more than or equal to four positive--demonstrated a treatment failure by ten years and that only 24.9 per cent survived. The survival rate of those with one to three positive nodes was 37.5 per cent and only 13.4 per cent if more than or equal to four nodes contained tumor. Also disturbing was the observation that one of four patients with negative axillary nodes displayed a treatment failure by ten years. Such findings mandate the urgency for immediate evaluation of available systemic therapeutic agents postoperatively. That systemic chemotherapy can enhance the disease-free state as well as survival rate of at least some patients with carcinoma of the breast is supported by the finding that the original observation at 18 months indicating an advantage for premenopausal women with more than or equal to four positive nodes who received triethylenethiophosphoramide persisted for as long as ten years. At that time, 21 per cent fewer patients in the triethylenethiophosphoramide group had treatment failures and 21 per cent more survived, an indication that the initial delay in treatment failure was reflected in patient survival rate. Data suggesting that the limited chemotherapy used was more effective in patients having smaller tumors are in keeping with the concept that adjuvant therapy is likely to be most effective in a host with minimal residual tumor burden. Of importance was the observation that 80 per cent of treatment failures occurring in ten years were apparent by five years of observation. Strikingly, 86 per cent of ten year treatment failures in patients with positive nodes occurred by five years. In patients with more than or equal to four positive nodes, this was so in 92 per cent of the instances. Such findings tend to discredit the claim that the worth of an alternative treatment for carcinoma of the breast can be ascertained only by a period of observation much longer than five years.</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="920"><COL><DATA> One hundred twenty patients with inoperable metastatic malignant melanoma were randomly allocated to treatment with either a combination of BCNU 150 mg/m2 and vincristine 2 mg/m2 given every 30 days, or one of two regimens of DTIC: 300 mg/m2/day x 6 or 100 mg/m2/8 hours x 18 given every 30 days. Eight of the 51 (16%) patients who were originally treated with the BCNU and vincristine combination had 50% or more objective tumor regression, compared to 6 out of 25 (24%) patients treated with daily injections of DTIC, and 6 out of 21 (29%) patients treated with DTIC injections every 8 hours. The median duration of response to the BCNU and vincristine combination was 60 days, and the median duration of survival from initiation of treatment was 6.5 months in the responders and 3.3 months in the nonresponders. The median duration of response was 90 and 100 days for the daily and 8-hour regimens of DTIC respectively, andthe median duration of survival from commencement of treatment was 8.5 months for the responders and 3.5 months for the nonresponders. None of the 43 patients who failed to respond to the initial treatment program or whose disease progressed after initial improvement responded to the alternate treatment regimen</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="302"><COL><DATA> 83 patients with colorectal carcinoma of the Dukes&apos; C class were randomised to receive postoperative adjuvant therapy with B.C.G. alone or in combination with oral doses of 5-fluorouracil (5-F.U.), and have been followed for up to thirty months. Results were compared with carefully selected historical controls who were treated by surgery alone. A statistically significant prolongation of both disease-free interval and overall survival was observed in 50 patients receiving the combination of B.C.G. and 5-F.U. (P=0.03, P=0.01 respectively) as well as in 33 patients receiving B.C.G. alone (P=0.03, P=0.05 respectively). The efficacy of B.C.G.+5-F.U. was independent of the number of tumour-involved lymph-nodes in the surgical specimen. In contrast, B.C.G. given alone appears to be highly effective among 10 patients with 6 or more positive lymph-nodes (P less than 0.04) and ineffective (as yet) among 23 patients with 5 or less positive lymph-nodes. These results suggest that adjuvant immunotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, can improve the prognosis of surgically treated patients with colorectal carcinoma of the Dukes&apos; C class</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="578"><COL><DATA> A prospective study with two cytotoxic combinations (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF), and adriamycin plus vincristine (AV)) was carried out in 110 patients with advanced breast cancer. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups in the response rate after primary treatment, the median duration of response, and the median survival. In both groups responders survived for longer than non-responders. Secondary treatment after crossover for progression or relapse resulted in response rates of 35% for AV and 20% for CMF. Toxicity was mainly represented by reversible haemosuppression. These results are comparable with those obtained with other multiple-drug regimens, and combination chemotherapy alone seems to have reached a plateau in its capacity to control disseminated breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="585"><COL><DATA> A prospective randomized clinical trial was undertaken in 184 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma to compare single drug chemotherapy with L-phenylalanine mustard (L-PAM) and intermittent combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluourouracil (CMF). All patients had not been previously treated with cytotoxic drugs and all had objectively measurable visceral of soft tissue disease. Of the 93 patients who received CMF, 49 (53%) achieved a complete (14 patients) or partial (35 patients) regression of measurable tumor, for a median duration of 25 weeks. Eighteen of the 91 patients (20%) treated with L-PAM responded, for a median duration of 13 weeks. The toxicity was primarily hematologic, and greater in the CMF group, which also received more cycles of therapy because of the higher rate and duration of response. The overall survival of CMF-treated patients was superior to that of the single drug group. The differences were even greater when the patients were subclassified according to the presence of liver involvement or nonambulatory performance status. The superior antitumor effect of CMF over L-PAM suggests that it may be a more effective drug regimen to be used as an adjuvant to primary therapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="793"><COL><DATA> This is a preliminary and comparative report of a randomized prospective study in which 14 unselected women with a proven histological diagnosis of endometrial adenocarcinoma were subjected to a course of external irradiation treatment with total 1,500 rad mid-pelvic dose delivered on five consecutive days followed by total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Surgery was performed within 1 week after the completion of radiation therapy. At the same time, 15 additional patients with identical histological diagnosis were treated with the conventional external irradiation technique of 5,000 rad delivered in 5 weeks followed by surgery 6 weeks later. The stage indicates no significant differences between these two radiotherapeutic modalities in regard to survival rate, recurrences or complications.

Total abdominal hysterectomy was done 4-8 weeks later. The 53 patients who received intracavitary irradiation had an actuarial 5 year disease-free survival rate of 75%; the survival rate of the 38 patients in the external beam group was 48%. Nine patients in the external beam group had recurrence or metastases compared to two in the intracavitary group. These recurrences were predominantly pelvic. Complications were also more frequent in the external beam group. These results demonstrate that intracavitary radiation is superior to external beam radiation using the regiments described</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="912"><COL><DATA> Fifty patients with metastatic malignant melanoma were randomized to treatment with either DTIC (2 mg/kg/day X 10 iv) or the combination of BCNU (150 mg/m2 iv) plus vincristine (VCR) (2 mg/m2 iv on Day 1 only). Treatment failures were crossed over to the alternate therapy. Primary, secondary, and cumulative response rates to DTIC were 29%, 9%, and 22%, respectively. Primary, secondary, and cumulative response rates to BCNU plus VCR were 23%, 29%, and 25%, respectively. Five of 26 patients (19%) experienced objective regression from secondary therapy after failure to respond to primary therapy. DTIC produced gastrointestinal and hematologic toxic effects; BCNU plus VCR produced gastrointestinal, hematologic, and neurologic toxic effects. VCR administered at a dose of 2 mg/m2 resulted in excessive neurologic toxic effects in 12 of 21 patients; a maximum VCR dose of 2 mg/injection was well tolerated by 15 subsequent patients without an adverse effect upon response rate. An analysis of tumor burden and organ involvement in responders and nonresponders suggests that DTIC is the first-choice treatment for patients with limited tumor burdens and nonvisceral metastases; BCNU plus VCR is the first-choice treatment for patients with extensive tumor burdens and visceral-predominant disease. However, failure to respond to primary therapy does not preclude response to secondary therapy with the alternate regimen</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="913"><COL><DATA> A total of 270 patients with metastatic malignant melanoma were entered into a randomized chemotherapy study conducted by the Central Oncology Group (COG) over a period of 2 years (COG protocol No. 7130). The study utilized DTIC, CCNU, BCNU, vincristine, and hydroxyurea. The results of therapy with DTIC alone were compared with three combinations: (a) DTIC, CCNU, and vincristine; (b) DTIC, BCNU, and vincristine: and (c) DTIC, BCNU, and hydroxyurea. There were 243 evaluable patients out of 270. The response rate was 17.3% (42 of 243 patients) for evaluable patients and 15.5% (42 of 270 patients) for all patients entered in the study. The results showed no statistically significant difference in the response rates among the four treatment arms. However, several significant points were observed: (a) A 13% response rate was obtained using a combination of agents that included DTIC in patients who had previously shown no response to DTIC used as a single agent. (b) There was a significant difference in survival time when comparing responders to those with no change and to those with progression. (c) Toxicity was noted to be greater in responders than in nonresponders. (d) Two of the four treatment arms were considered most advantageous due to the ease of administration. These treatment arms were DTIC, BCNU, and vincristine and DTIC, CCNU, and vincristine administered in 5-day courses every 6 weeks. (e) The percentage of response and length of survival were significantly greater in patients without brain or liver metastasis.

Patients with disease confined to skin, subcutaneous tissue nodes, lung, or pleura had a significantly superior response rate to that in those with disease involving liver, bone or brain.

Secondary responses were not observed with either treatment regimen. Toxicity with the combination program included leukocyte depression (less than 3,000/cu mm) in 25% and platelet depression (less than 100,000/cu mm) in 40% compared to 52% leukocyte depression and 16% platelet depression after adriamycin. There were no responses after the combination treatment program in the absence of myelosuppression. There was nausea and vomiting in virtually all patients, which was moderately severe in one third of the patients receiving the combination and in only 10% of those receiving adriamycin. Alopecia developed in all who received adriamycin but in only 15% of the combination treatment group. The combination treatment response of 28% was of the same order as most response rates previously reported in this disease.

A study of combinations of DTIC with two nitrosoureas indicated no additive effect. Survival and response were strongly correlated with sex, ambulatory status, and site of disease involvement. As secondary treatment DTIC was less effective, indicating only a 3% response rate. Survival benefit could be related to response. Among the ten largest contributors of patients, response rates varied from 3% to 40%. Similarly, while the overall response rate was not different for the combinations as compared to DTIC alone, the variation noted from study to study reflects the need for controlled randomized trials of chemotherapy for patients with malignant melanoma</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="919"><COL><DATA> This prospective randomized Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) study (1071) was designed to compare a new and promising cytotoxic agent TIC Mustard (triazeno imidazole carboxamide mustard, NSC 82196) with DTIC (dimethyl triazeno imidazole carboxamide, NSC 45388) in the treatment of inoperable melanoma. One hundred and seventy-eight patients were randomized to receive either DTIC (150 mg/m2/day X 5) or TIC Mustard (800 mg/m2/day X 5). Of this group 145 patients were evaluable for tumor response at the completion of the study. Objective responses were seen in 15/79 (19.0%) DTIC patients and 4/66 (6.1%) TIC Mustard patients. Adjustment of crude response rates yielded final response rates of 18.2% for DTIC patients and 5.8% for TIC Mustard. These differences were significant at the p less than or equal to .03 level. Median response duration was 15 weeks for the DTIC responders and 4 weeks for the TIC Mustard responders. Responders and nonresponders did not differ significantly in any of the standard prognostic categories. However, responders had a significantly longer median survival (47.5 weeks) compared to that for nonresponders (17.8 weeks). Toxicity was tolerable for either drug and no deaths were ascribed to either.

However, a more detailed analysis, according to certain prognostic features, showed that extended mastectomy improved the results in one subgroup: cancers of inner or medial quadrants, axillary N+. Within this group the difference was highly significant for a smaller subgroup (190 patients) including only tumors T1 and T2. In conclusion, there is no indication for extended mastectomy in any cancers of the outer quadrants or in those of the inner or medial quadrants without axillary involvement. A limited indication for extended mastectomy may be provisionally retained for T1 and T2 cancers of the inner or medial quadrants with axillary involvement</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="238"><COL><DATA> In a prospectively randomized study the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU on survival and recurrence was analyzed in 274 evaluable patients with colorectal carcinoma who either underwent a curative or a palliative resection. In the treatment group, chemotherapy consisted of the intravenous administration of 5-FU 12 mg/kg daily for four consecutive days, then 6 mg/kg/per day on alternate days to the point of toxicity or to a maximum of 5 doses, followed by 12 mg/kg/week for one year. Durg toxicity was rarely severe and consisted of nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia in slightly more than half of all patients. There have been no drug-related deaths. Analysis of the survival curves and disease-free interval curves reveal some evidence of drug benefit in both the curative group of resections and the palliative group of resections. However, this benefit is not significant except in those treated to toxicity. The disease-free interval after curative resection is significantly longer in patients treated with 5-FU to the point of toxicity with a white blood count less than 4,000 cells/mm3. We conclude that a preliminary analysis of the Central Oncology Group data in this trial does not make a convincing case for the use of 5-FU as an adjuvant to the surgical treatment of colorectal carcinoma</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="251"><COL><DATA> A clinical trial involving 462 colon, rectum, and breast cancer patients randomized among four different dosage regimens of 5-FU (an intravenous loading course, a weekly intravenous schedule, a nontoxic schedule, and an oral schedule) has shown a significantly better response among colon-rectum cancer patients for the intravenous loading course. In addition, duration of response and time to progression are also significantly better. Overall survival is approaching significance for the colon rectum group (p value .082).

Information has been obtained from 1,665 patients eligible for follow-up from 34 NSABP member institutions in Canada and the United States.  Results from that trial, at present in its sixth year with patients on study for an average of 36 months, (26 to 62 months), fail to demonstrate an advantage for those who had a radical mastectomy.  No significant difference in the treatment failure or survival has as yet been observed in clinically negative node patients who have been randomly managed by conventional radical mastectomy, total mastectomy with postoperative regional radiation or total mastectomy followed by axillary dissection of those patients who subsequently develop positive nodes.  Similarly, there presently exists no difference between patients with clinically positive nodes treated by radical mastectomy or by total mastectomy followed by radiation.  Of particular interest is the observation that based upon findings from radical mastectomy patients, there may be as many as 40% of patients having a total mastectomy who had histologically positive nodes unremoved, to date only 15% have developed positive nodes requiring an axillary dissection.  The persistence of such a difference in incidence would have profound biological significance.  The discovery that leaving behind positive axillary nodes has as yet not been influential in enhancing the incidence of distant metastases or the overall proportion of treatment failures and that a disproportionate number of treatment failures in the total mastectomy group occurred in those who subsequently required axillary dissection provides reinforcement to the view that positive axillary lymph nodes are not the predecessor of distant tumor spread but are a manifestation of disseminated disease.</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="641"><COL><DATA> Ninety-two women with advanced breast cancer were allocated at random to receive either cytotoxic or endocrine treatment.

The randomized clinical trial compares radical mastectomy with a more conservative procedure consisting of mammary resection plus axillary dissection plus radiotherapy. The resection comprises an entire quadrant of the breast together with the overlying skin and the corresponding portion of the fascial sheet of the pectoralis major. The axillary dissection is performed in continuity with the resected breast quadrant except in cases with tumors of lower inner quadrants, who need two separate incisions. After surgery the patients receive 6000 rads to the residual breast tissue over five to six weeks, starting 15 days after operation. The cosmetic results are satisfactory in approximately 70% of cases. The trial is limited to cases with tumors less than 2 cm and no palpable axillary nodes (T1N0M0). Patients with histologically positive lymph nodes (N+) are submitted to adjuvant chemotherapy with CMF for one year. From September 1973, to October 1976, 331 cases entered the trial. One hundred sixty were treated with radical mastectomy and 164 with the conservative procedure. Axillary metastases were found in 23% of the radical and in 29% of the conservative surgery group. Four local-regional recurrences have occurred till now, two in each group. Five cases in the radical mastectomy group and one in the conservative group had distant metastases.

Four hundred and 15 patients with inoperable metastatic malignant melanoma, excluding those with cutaneous metastases only, were randomized to one of three drug treatments: DTIC alone, methyl-CCNU alone, or the combination DTIC plus methyl-CCNU. Responses were seen in 14% of DTIC patients (19/127), 15% of methyl-CCNU patients (18/119) and 14% of DTIC plus methyl-CCNU patients (18/122). Duration of response was the same (14 weeks) for all three treatment groups. There was no difference among the treatments in achieving complete responses. Survival was improved significantly for responders (50 weeks) compared with nonresponders (15 weeks) regardless of treatment regimen. Toxicities were generally tolerable. DTIC caused significantly more gastrointestinal toxicity than methyl-CCNU. Methyl-CCNU caused significantly more bone marrow toxicity than DTIC. There were three drug-related deaths. All occurred in patients on combination DTIC plus methyl-CCNU. Important pretreatment characteristics that favor response are ambulatory status, female, less than 50 years old, no prior chemotherapy and no liver or brain metastases.

Seven were treated conservatively, and eight were vaccinated with BCG and autologous irradiated cells. Three vaccinated patients suffered widespread recurrence within three months. All four vaccinated patients who suffered a recurrence within the first year died, while none of the three controls with recurrent disease died.

Some degree of drug toxicity was seen in the majority of patients, was rarely severe, and there have been no drug-related deaths. Analysis of the survival curves and disease-free interval curves reveal definite evidence of drug benefit in two unfavorable subgroups, namely patients with Dukes C tumors and in patients whose tumor was located in the rectum. In the chemotherapy groups, patients who were treated to toxicity (WBC less than 4000 mm3), the disease-free interval was significantly longer than the nonleukopenic patients.

The mean age, sex, site and stage of the disease were similar in the control and perfusion groups and there was no statistically significant difference in postoperative complications or hospital stay (17.1 +/- 7.9 days control, 15.8 +/- 7.4 days perfusion group). So far, 23 deaths have occurred in the control group (20 due to recurrent disease) and 7 in the perfusion group (5 due to recurrent disease).

Favorable prognostic factors included metastatic disease confined to skin or lymph nodes (33% responses), performance status greater than 70% (24% response rate), and administration of three or more courses of chemotherapy (31% response rate). The dose limiting toxicity was myelosuppression, which was equal on both regimens.

All patients received surgery with curative intent; 470 also received TSPA, 176 received FdUrd, and 867 received surgery only. The unique VA system permitted complete follow-up through 1977, with 10,902 person-years of observation accrued among 1,613 male patients (mean survival = 6.8 yr). Expected mortality and cancer incidence were computed by applying U.S. Mortality Statistics and Connecticut Tumor Registry age-, race-, sex-, and calendar time-specific rates to the person-years of observation. The mortality experience of the 3 groups was similar. Overall, there was a significant excess in total mortality (observed/expected = 1,359/553) attributable mainly to colorectal cancer (584/14), arteriosclerotic heart disease (258/215.9), pneumonia (41/17), gastric and duodenal ulcers (15/4), and cirrhosis (14/6). No excess mortality from noncolorectal cancers was apparent, nor were there significant differences by treatment: TSPA (22/22), FdUrd (9/12), and surgery only (50/42). Among 1,402 white patients, no significant excess of incident noncolorectal cancers were observed among patients treated with TSPA (30/31, FdUrd (14/15), or surgery only (63/58). Seven incident cases of leukemia developed (4.1 expected) among all patients of various groups: TSPA (3/1.3), FdUrd (1/0.6), and surgery only (3/2.2). No excess of new primary cancers was observed among 211 nonwhite patients. An inverse relationship between the occurrence of second primary cancer and age at diagnosis, irrespective of therapy, was suggested.

Preoperative serum albumin levels did not differ between patients who developed postoperative complications and those who had an uneventful postoperative course whether or not they received albumin postoperatively. The present study does not confirm earlier results indicating that serum albumin alone is of prognostic value for the postoperative course following colorectal surgery.

Median survival in treated patients was 44 weeks, which was significantly longer than the nine weeks seen in controls. In patients without metastases median survival was 48 weeks in the treated group and 12 weeks in controls. In patients with metastases it was 30 weeks in treated patients and seven weeks in controls.

Fifteen patients were excluded because of inoperability. Sixty-seven patients were randomly selected to receive 4,000 rads of cobalt radiation for eight days prior to operation; 57 patients were operated upon without receiving radiation therapy. No significant differences were noted between the two groups with regard to age, sex, tumor site, experience of the surgeon, method of approach or surgical technique. Eight esophageal resections were performed upon 47 of the 62 irradiated patients and 33 of the 47 nonirradiated patients. Of the 62 irradiated patients, 14 died during operation, compared with 11 of the 47 nonirradiated patients, the difference between the two groups not being statistically significant. Irradiation was associated with a higher mortality for lesions in the mid third part of the esophagus, 11 of 29 versus four of 19, but again, the difference was not significant. In the irradiated patients, the five year actuarial postoperative survival rate was 9.5 versus 11.5 per cent for the nonirradiated patients.

In both schedules the daily dose of PALA was administered iv over 1 hour, while the dose of 5-FU was administered iv over 30 minutes, starting 3 hours after completion of the PALA dose. Doses of both drugs were changed simultaneously, based on toxic effects. Partial responses were seen in four of 24 evaluable patients receiving the weekly regimen and in three of 26 patients receiving the 5-day regimen. Skin rash, mucositis, and diarrhea were the dose-limiting toxic effects in both treatment regimens. These toxic effects were more common and severe at higher doses and on the weekly schedule.

Thirty-one patients were Duke&apos;s group A; 49 group B; 61 group C; and 17 group D; an additional four patients were randomized in error. The adjuvant group received the usual clinical care and 125 mg razoxane twice daily for 5 consecutive days (monday-friday) every week indefinitely. Control patients received the same clinical care as the adjuvant group, but no razoxane. At 3 years, 134 patients (84%) are evaluable. The recurrence rate in the first 6 months was 20% and 28% respectively in the Duke&apos;s B and C controls compared with 4% and 9% in the corresponding razoxane treated patients. Most recurrences occurred within the first 6 months from randomization. When all patients as randomized are included in the analysis of survival, irrespective of whether they were cured by surgery (Duke&apos;s A), had advanced cancer (Duke&apos;s D), or took no razoxane when randomized to take it, then as might be expected any differences there may be between the razoxane-treated and control patients with minimal residual disease (Duke&apos;s B and C) are so distorted that the p value of the difference in survival was 0.93. If however only patients with Duke&apos;s group B or C are taken (49 controls and 47 treated), log-rank analysis reveals a difference in the cancer mortality curves (p = 0.07). If patients who had been randomized to take razoxane, but who had not taken it at any time (and therefore received the same treatment as controls) are analysed with the controls, the difference between the two groups increases further, with p less than 0.05. The razoxane-treated patients experienced no significant toxicity apart from a readily reversible mild leukopenia in 52% while gastrointestinal symptoms necessitated stopping the drug in only four patients. These four all took the drug for less than 4 weeks. Because there was no toxicity to subtract from any benefit razoxane adjuvant treatment produced and the quality of life was not impaired, the therapeutic benefit of surgery wsa increased to the extent that razoxane increased survival of patients with Duke&apos;s B and C tumours</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="443"><COL><DATA> </DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="470"><COL><DATA> A randomized study was performed in advanced cancer to test the effectiveness of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in maintaining and improving nutrition, to examine the effects of TPN on tumor growth, and to determine if TPN altered chemotherapy response rates, treatment tolerance, and survival. Forty-five patients on identical chemotherapy were randomized to TPN versus ad libitum feeding. TPN was well tolerated. No clinical or tumor marker evidence suggesting neoplastic growth stimulation was obtained. Chemotherapy-related complications and chemotherapy responses did not differ between the two groups. TPN had little effect on performance status. TPN patients gained an average of 2.8 kg before chemotherapy, but triceps skinfold and mid-arm muscle area did not change significantly during TPN. Survival did not improve with TPN. We conclude that current techniques of TPN are of limited benefit in advanced colon cancer. A small subset of patients with short-gut malabsorption may be helped.

No significant difference was observed between L-PAM as compared with R.T. plus L-PAM (P = 0.85). The difference between CMF and R.T. plus CMF was significant in support of CMF alone (P = 0.04). The frequency of recurrence between R.T. plus L-PAM and R.T. plus CMF showed no difference. A comparison of the chemotherapy only regimens showed an advantage of CMF over L-PAM (P = 0.05).

None of the adjuvant regimens appeared to offer any clear-cut advantage for the estrogen receptor negative patients. Those women whose primary tumor contains estrogen receptors appear to be in a prognostically favorable group, when their treatment regimen included the antiestrogen, tamoxifen.

Both relapse-free survival (controls 44.6%, CMF group 59.5%) and total survival (controls 66.2%, CMF group 78.4%) were significantly improved. The findings were related to the number of diseased axillary nodes and amount of drug administered, and were independent of CMF-induced amenorrhoea. Menopausal state alone appeared to affect the five-year results only when the amount of drug administered was not taken into account. Salvage treatment at first relapse failed to improve total survival in the controls compared with the CMF group. Acute toxic manifestations were moderate and reversible.

Following the maintenance randomization 12% of the patients converted from a PR to a CR status.

This difference was observed only for partial responders (p = 0.01) and not for complete responders. Patients receiving CMFH tended to maintain higher hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet levels, and receive a higher dosage of each of the cytotoxic drugs. The results are taken as evidence that the addition of fluoxymesterone to a maintenance CMF regimen provides a therapeutic advantage.

A comparison of patients with similar clinical nodal status and tumor location who were treated either by radical mastectomy (RM) or by total mastectomy plus radiation therapy (TM + RT) failed to indicate that radiation of IM nodes reduced the probability of distant treatment failure (TF) or mortality. When findings from patients having equivalent clinical nodal status and tumor location treated by TM alone or TM + RT were compared, it was found that the addition of RT failed to alter the probability of the occurrence of a distant TF or of death. This was despite the fact that in the nonradiated group two putative sources of further tumor spread, i.e., positive axillary and IM nodes, were left unremoved and untreated.

By random assignment, the patients received 5 mg/m2 Corynebacterium parvum (CP) subcutaneously on day 1, in addition to VAC/FMC. Of the 150 evaluable patients, 33 of 76 (45%) and 36 of 74 (49%) had complete or partial response to VAC/FMC plus CP, respectively. The Kaplan-Maier curves of duration of remission and survival were almost identical (medians 14.5 vs 12.1 months and 22.2 vs 21.1 months, respectively). The hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity were also similar in the two study groups. However, 19 of 74 (26%) patients developed skin ulcers after repeated injections of CP. These patients showed prolonged survival (P = 0.002, log rank test). These results suggest that adding nonspecific immunostimulation with CP to currently available chemotherapy on day 1 is of no benefit to most patients with metastatic breast cancer, but may select an &quot;immunoreactive subgroup with increased local toxicity and survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="630"><COL><DATA> Patients with early breast cancer (n = 1022) were treated between March 1970 and October 1975 in a prospective clinical trial.

Patients were randomly allocated to received dibromodulcitol + Adriamycin (DA, 55 patients) or DA + tamoxifen (DAT, 67 patients). An additional 13 patients less than 50 years of age were assigned to DAT (DATN). Pretreatment characteristics were similar across both regimens. DAT and DATN yielded similar results in the less than 50-year-old cohort. DAT tended to be superior to DA with respect to response rate (55% versus 36%, p = 0.004), time to treatment failure (medians: 170 days versus 110 days, log rank p = 0.001), responders&apos; time to treatment failure (360 days versus 220 days, p = 0.035), and survival (340 days versus 270 days, p = 0.18). Toxicity was similar in both regimens. Thus, addition of tamoxifen to a second-line DA regimen appears to increase the therapeutic effectiveness.

Patients were allocated on a random basis to receive preoperative intralymphatic immunotherapy with MER-BCG, surgical excision with regional lymphadenectomy and intraoperative infiltration of MER-BCG, and postoperative monthly intradermal vaccinations with BCG; or surgery and lymphadenectomy alone. Twenty patients followed for more than 1 year are the basis of this report. Fifteen patients accepted randomization, whereas four patients entered the immunotherapy group and one entered the control group at their own insistence. Immunotherapy improved the disease-free survival of patients in this trial.

Wide local excision and excisional regional lymphadenectomy alone were performed in 185 patients and the results were compared with those of surgery plus chemotherapy with dacarbazine (in 192 patients), surgery plus immunotherapy with bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine (in 203), and surgery plus chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy (in 181). The rates of disease-free survival and overall survival at 36 months were 30.4 +/- 8.3 per cent (mean +/- S.E.) and 41.6 +/- 10.0 per cent, respectively, after surgical treatment alone; 37.2 +/- 7.9 per cent and 46.5 +/- 8.3 per cent after surgery plus chemotherapy; 34.8 +/- 7.9 per cent and 48.7 +/- 8.7 per cent after surgery plus immunotherapy; and 33.6 +/- 7.9 per cent and 50.0 +/- 8.8 per cent after surgery plus a combination of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

Mantoux response, lymphocyte count, PHA stimulation and serum immunoglobulin levels. 38% of patients complained of side-effects from the levamisole and 17% stopped the treatment. It is concluded that any beneficial effects of levamisole in patients with advanced cancer may be mediated by a non-immunological mechanism, or by some immunological process other than those studied here, or may require a longer period of administration than 4 weeks. Variation in skin test results in the placebo group throw some doubt on previous reports of immunopotentiation of cancer patients by levamisole</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="881"><COL><DATA> The Southwest Oncology Group performed a randomized study comparing combination chemotherapy alone versus combination chemotherapy plus BCG versus DTIC plus BCG in the treatment of disseminated malignant melanoma. A 31% response rate was noted with combination chemotherapy alone, a 27% response rate with combination chemotherapy plus BCG, and an 18% response rate with DTIC plus BCG. Survival was not influenced by type of therapy, but the responders had significantly longer survival than the nonresponders. There appeared to be some significant differences in response as related to age wherein those patients between the ages of 30 and 60 years had a higher response rate to combination chemotherapy as compared to DTIC plus BCG. Those patients older than 60 years of age had a higher response rate in the BCG groups. Furthermore, in those patients older than 60 years of age who responded, their duration of response was longer if they received BCG than those who did not receive BCG. It should be emphasized that those differences noted in various age groups could occur by chance alone. These differences should be studied in the future, by appropriate pretreatment stratifications. Patients with higher peripheral lymphocyte counts had significantly better response rates and those patients with higher numbers of positive delayed hypersensitivity skin tests had significantly greater survival.

Chemotherapy consisted of DTIC 250 mg/M2 of the body surface area daily x five days and actinomycin-D 2 mg/M2 on day 1 repeated every 3--4 weeks. Chemoimmunotherapy consisted of the same regimen plus C. parvum 2 mg/M2 I.V. daily for 14 days before every third cycle of chemotherapy, plus 2 mg/M2 I.V. daily on days 7 and 14 of each 21--28 day chemotherapy cycle. There was 32 evaluable chemotherapy and 33 evaluable chemoimmunotherapy patients and the groups were well balanced for clinical and pathologic as well as prognostic variables. The complete and partial remission rates, remission and survival durations, and hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities were different in the two randomized groups being 6 and 3%, 9 and 9%, 7.6 and 12 months, 8.8 and 6.0 months, 20 and 16%, and 62 and 70%, respectively for these parameters. This difference was not statistically significant. Therefore, it can be concluded that the results of chemotherapy with actinomycin-D plus DTIC were not substantially different from those reported using DTIC alone, and that we cannot recommend the addition of actinomycin-D to DTIC for palliative management in these patients. Furthermore, C. parvum immunotherapy did not add to chemotherapy in terms of remission rate, remission duration, or survival for patients with Stage IV B malignant melanoma</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="883"><COL><DATA> One hundred and ninety-five patients with metastatic malignant melanoma were randomized to receive either cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 IV plus DTIC 600 mg/m2 IV day 1 (CD); or cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m2 IV, DTIC 400 mg/m2 IV, and piperazinedione 4 mg/m2 IV on day 1 (PCD). Therapy was repeated every 21 days. Patient groups were similar regarding pretreatment performance status, evaluability, and site of metastases. The overall response rate was low, 11% on CD and 12% on PCD. Paradoxically, patients with visceral disease responded at least as frequently as patients with skin and lymph node metastases only (12% and 6% respectively for CD, and 15% and 5% for PCD). Survival was identical on each treatment program, with medians of six months. The major dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression, which was similar on each treatment program. We conclude that the addition of piperazinedione to cyclophosphamide plus DTIC does not improve the response rate in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma. Both of the treatment programs (CD and PCD) utilizing one-day DTIC produced response rates slightly (but not meaningfully) lower than those previously obtained with cyclophosphamide plus five-day DTIC</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="884"><COL><DATA> A total of 260 patients with clinically localized melanoma (Stage I) from 18 medical institutions in the Southeastern Cancer Study Group were randomized to receive either surgical treatment alone, or surgery plus Corynebacterium parvum immunotherapy. A multivariant analysis (Cox regression model) of nine prognostic factors was performed on 110 patients with a minimum of two years follow-up. The dominant prognostic variables were thickness (P = 0.0007) and anatomic location of the melanoma (trunk versus other, P = 0.015). Disease-free survival curves were then calculated for 204 surgically evaluable patients. Overall, there was no significant difference in three-year survival for the two-treatment arms, which was 81% for the adjuvant immunotherapy group compared to 67% for the surgical control group (P = 0.10). The median follow-up period was 24 months (range, 1-60 months). However, when the data was subgrouped by tumor thickness, an apparent benefit of immunotherapy was observed in 49 patients with melanomas greater than 3 mm in thickness. Only five of 23 such patients relapsed after receiving C. parvum. Their three-year disease-free survival was 73%. In contrast, 13 of 26 patients who did not receive immunotherapy have relapsed so far and their three-year disease-free survival was only 33% (P = 0.01). In the 175 patients with melanomas less than 3 mm in thickness, both treatment arms had identical three-year disease-free survival rates of 83%. No significant differences between the treatment arms were observed using other prognostic variables, including the level of invasion. Toxicity to C. parvum injections was minimal in most patients. It is concluded that a prognostic factor analysis is critically important in adjunctive trials of melanoma to determine which dominant variables should be used for analyzing patient subgroups; that C. parvum immunotherapy appears to be associated with an improved disease-free survival rate in the subgroup of patients with melanomas greater than 3 mm thickness (this early encouraging data must still be confirmed with continued patients accrual and a longer observation period); and that patients with melanomas less than 3 mm thickness have a relatively favorable prognosis after appropriate surgical treatment, and immunotherapy does not improve their survival rates</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="885"><COL><DATA> WHO clinical trial 6 studies the effect of long-term adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and chemoimmunotherapy) after radical surgery in malignant melanoma with high risk of recurrence.

Intraarterial chemotherapy consisted of DTIC 80 mg/m2 + 8 days prior to surgery. Systemic chemotherapy consisted of courses of vinblastine (6 mg/m2), thiotepa (6 mg/m2), rufocromycine (60 microgram/m2), methotrexate (15 mg/m2) on day 1, and procarbazine (30 mg/m12 X 7 days.

Two partial remissions (of 2+ and 6.5 months) were achieved in the no-mannitol arm and one complete response and four partial responses (of 1, 2, 2.5, 5.5, and 8 months) were seen in the mannitol arm. Moderate, severe, and life-threatening renal toxicity was less in the mannitol arm, and patients tolerated more doses of cisplatin. The renal toxicity occurred mostly after the first dose of chemotherapy and did not seem to be cumulative. Other side effects were comparable in both arms. We concluded that renal toxicity is less severe in patients treated with cisplatin, hydration, and mannitol and that the use of cisplatin alone or in combination with other active agent(s) should be considered for further evaluation in previously untreated patients with malignant melanoma</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="939"><COL><DATA> Results of a prospective randomized clinical trial conducted by the WHO Collaborating Centers for the Evaluation of Methods of Diagnosis and Treatment of Melanoma are reported.

Median survival for control patients is 33 months whereas it is estimated to be in excess of four years for the adjuvant therapy group.

Survival and disease-free intervals are longer in the chemotherapy arm for patients in all prospective stratification subgroups (proximal and total vs distal subtotal gastrectomy, presence or absence of lymph node metastases, invasion of adjacent organs vs confined to stomach wall and location of tumor within the stomach).

With a median time of follow-up of 33 months, relapse rates among 181 reviewed and evaluable patients are 20/85 (23.5%) for pre- and 23/96 (24%) for postmenopausal patients. Results for premenopausal women, while better than historical controls at a similar time interval, appear inferior to other published adjuvant studies (e.g., NSABP and Milan). Although total relapse rates were 23/100 (23%) for six months and 20/81 (25%) for 12 months of therapy, suggestive differences were encountered by menopausal status with early trends favoring 12 months of treatment for premenopausal patients and six months of treatment for postmenopausal patients. During this same period, 283 patients with four or more involved axillary nodes were randomized to 1-3 treatment arms: six months of CMF, six months of CMF preceded by local-regional x-ray therapy (XRT), or 12 months of CMF. The latter arm was closed in February 1980 while the two six-month chemotherapy arms remain open as of January 1983. Relapse rates for 174 reviewed and evaluable patients on the three arms include: 27/76 (36%) for six months CMF, 15/54 (28%) for XRT and CMF, and 24/44 (45%) for 12 months CMF. Local-regional relapse rates were 12/120 (10%) for the combined two non-XRT arms and 3/54 (6%) for the XRT treatment arm (p = 0.34). Thus, at this early stage of follow-up there are still no statistically significant differences between six or 12 months of adjuvant CMF therapy and neither definite beneficial nor detrimental effects of prechemotherapy adjuvant radiation therapy.

The operative mortality and morbidity, palliation of dysphagia and postoperative nutritional status were compared in the 2 groups. Intubation resulted in 3 deaths (5.5 per cent) and gastric bypass in 4 deaths (7.8 per cent). Intubation was complicated by chest infection in 13 patients (24 per cent) but complications related to the procedure occurred in only 5 patients and included tube migration (2), respiratory obstruction (1), bleeding (2) and oesophageal perforation (1). Gastric bypass was complicated by chest infection in 14 patients (27 per cent), but procedure-related complications were common and included pneumothorax (3), wound infection (6), subphrenic abscess (2), anastomotic leak (5) and purulent neck discharge (3). Palliation of dysphagia was achieved in 93 per cent of patients following intubation and 92 per cent of patients following bypass. Nutritional status improved more rapidly following bypass.

Neurologic toxicities due to tegafur were mild and occurred in less than 10% of the treatment courses.

Actuarial analysis with median follow-up of 653 days revealed an advantage in continuous disease-free and overall survival in the patient group receiving chemotherapy (P = 0.0008 and P = 0.04, respectively, one-sided Mantel-Haenszel test).

There has been no significant effect on mortality at this point in the study. This endocrine adjuvant therapy was well tolerated and treatment was discontinued in only 14 (2 X 2%) patients as a direct result of side-effects.

Median time to failure to treatment procedures scheduled in arm A (CMF leads to CMF + T) was longer than that to treatment in arm B (CMF plus T) (56 and 48 weeks, respectively; P = 0.08). Median survival was longer in patients randomized to treatment A (111 weeks) than in patients randomized to treatment B (78 weeks), but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.25). It can be concluded from this study that a combination of endocrine therapy and chemotherapy is significantly more active than chemotherapy alone in inducing an objective remission. This strategy of treatment is advisable in situations urgently requiring a clinical response. However, as a sequence of chemical and endocrine therapy induced a longer time to development of progressive disease and a better survival, sequential therapy is advisable for common clinical use</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="637"><COL><DATA> Five-year results of a prospective, randomized clinical trial of three treatment regimes--(a) cytoxan, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF); (b) CMF plus the antiestrogen drug, tamoxifen (CMFT); and (c) CMFT plus bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinations--in 312 women with stage-II breast cancer are reported. Estrogen receptors (ER) were measured in all of the primary tumors. Addition of tamoxifen to CMF therapy significantly decreased the number of recurrences at five years in ER positive patients with four or more positive axillary lymph nodes. Addition of tamoxifen to CMF had no effect on disease-free survival in ER-positive patients with 1-3 positive axillary lymph nodes or in patients with ER-negative tumors. Addition of BCG vaccinations had no discernible effect on disease-free survival. ER measurements in the primary tumor provide important prognostic information regardless of treatment, with ER-positive patients having lower recurrence rates and mortality after five years. ER measurements also have predictive value for response to endocrine therapy. Further follow-up is needed to determine whether tamoxifen is delaying recurrence or preventing it in a subset of these patients</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="644"><COL><DATA> The role of antiestrogen treatment in high risk postmenopausal patients with primary breast cancer is currently evaluated in a nationwide, prospective randomized trial conducted by the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group. The primary treatment is total mastectomy and radiotherapy. As of February 1, 1982, 720 women were randomized to treatment with tamoxifen (30 mg daily for 1 year) and 691 women were randomized to no further therapy. Life-table analysis after 36 months shows a difference in recurrence rates of 9% (p = 0.19) in favor of the tamoxifen-treated patients. The material has been analyzed with respect to established prognostic factors such as age, degree of anaplasia, tumor size, and number of positive nodes. The rates of recurrent disease are lower in all subsets of patients treated with tamoxifen, but are only statistically significant in patients 50-59 years of age or with 4 or more positive lymph nodes. Regardless of treatment, ER negative patients have a 23% higher recurrence rate than ER positive patients after 18 months of analysis (p = 0.0033); this represents an approximate doubling of risk, and is independent of age, degree of anaplasia, tumor size, or lymph node status. With regard to PgR status, there is 11% higher recurrence rate in the PgR negative than in the PgR positive patients (p = 0.097)</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="652"><COL><DATA> We report the 5-yr results of a prospective randomized study comparing 12 versus 6 cycles of CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil) with the aim to evaluate the possibility of reducing the duration of adjuvant treatment without compromising the therapeutic effect of the multimodal approach. At 5-yr from mastectomy, both relapse-free survival (CMF 12: 59%; CMF 6: 65.6%) and total survival (CMF 12: 72.7%; CMF 6: 76.9%) were not significantly different in the two treatment groups. Within the two series, no difference was detected between pre- and postmenopausal patients (CMF 12: 59.3% versus 57.6%; CMF 6: 66.5% versus 63.1%), while findings were inversely related to the number of involved axillary nodes. The analysis of relapse-free survival confirmed that in both menopausal groups, relapse-free survival was not significantly affected by estrogen receptor status. Acute toxic manifestations were moderate and reversible. In particular, no drug-induced leukemia nor increased incidence of solid tumors other than breast cancer were documented in this series. Present results after 12 CMF cycles are almost identical to those of our first CMF adjuvant study. Current findings are sufficiently mature to indicate that the maximum tumor cytoreduction with CMF occurs within a relatively short period of time.

Two hundred and forty cases of these rare tumors were evaluable. Of 146 evaluable patients with measurable disease, 13/80 (16.3%) of Adriamycin-treated patients and 16/66 (24.2%) of patients receiving the combination showed an objective response (P greater than 0.05). Lung metastases responded more frequently (P equal to 0.04) to combination therapy, but there was no survival advantage.

All patients received total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy plus complementary radium therapy on the vaginal stump. After the conventional treatment, patients were randomly allocated to adjuvant hormone therapy or no further treatment. Hormone therapy consisted of gestonorone caproate (17 alpha-hydroxy-19-norpregn-4-en 3, 20 dione caproate) administered i.m. at the dose of 200 mg/week for 1 year. Of the 62 patients who entered the study, 51 were considered evaluable (24 with adjuvant hormone therapy and 27 with no further treatment). Five patients had a relapse: four of these were in the group with no further treatment. Actuarial relapse-free survival analysis at 5 years was 95.7% in the group of adjuvant-treated patients and 82.8% in the control group.

The use of BCG administered intraperitoneally in a randomized study of patients with gastric, pancreatic and colorectal cancer proved of no benefit. On the other hand, when BCG was given orally in a randomized study of patients with resectable cancer of the colon and in nonrandomized consecutive studies of patients with malignant melanoma and stage IV carcinoma of the breast survival was increased. In a group of patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer selective stimulation of the immune system with NED 137 produced a significant increase in survival when compared with the survival of historical controls (the patients given BCG intraperitoneally along with 5-fluorouracil for gastrointestinal cancer).

The split-course consisted of 10 fractions of 250 rad each, 5 times a week, up to 2500 rad followed by a rest period of approximately 2 weeks and then another 2500 rad was given (250 X 10). The continuous course consisted of 30 fractions of 170 rad each, 5 times per week, for a total of 5100 rad. In both groups the external pelvis irradiation was followed by intracavitary brachytherapy in the uterus and vagina, with tandem-colpostat or tandem only, for a dose of 3000 rad at point A for the former, or at 2 cm from the center of the linear source for the latter. In cases where brachytherapy was not possible, a boost of external irradiation with reduced field, with a dose of 1600 rad (200 X 8) was advised.

Concerning localization of the tumors in the esophagus, 2 were in the upper third, 36 in the middle third and 18 in the lower third. The length of the filling defects in the esophagogram (X-ray) was in 9 patients less than 5 cm, in 31 5-8 cm, and in 16 patients greater than 8 cm. Squamous cell carcinoma was found in 51 patients, adenocarcinoma in 3, and anaplastic (squamous cell) carcinoma in 2 patients. Modality A consisted of a combination of 5-FU (10 mg/kg i.v. 2 X weekly, 4 weeks) and bleomycin (10 mg/m2 i.v., 2 X 4 weeks) which was given concurrently with radiation (3600-4000 rad - 1000 rad weekly). In modality B the combination of 5-FU (same dose) and adriamycin (30 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, 2, 23 and 24) was applied with the same schedule and dosage of radiation. Seventy-five percent of the patients (21/28) have responded to treatment (CR + PR) in modality A, with 11 complete and 10 partial responses. In arm B, response was recorded in 64% of patients (18/28), with 2 complete and 16 partial responses.

The pretreatment performance status of all patients was greater than 50% (ambulatory), and there was an equal distribution of patients with favorable pretreatment characteristics into each of the treatment regimens. Complete responses were only seen to 5-FU, but were obtained in only 3% of instances. The overall complete plus partial response rates were not different for 5-FU (8%) versus 6-TG (3%), or for patients who had shown prior progression on chemotherapy and who then received 6-TG in a nonrandomized fashion (7%). The time to tumor progression on each of the treatment programs was similar, 1.0 months. Survival was also similar in each regimen in the randomized study (6.3 months for 5-FU versus 7.9 months for 6-TG). However, survival was only 4.8 months for patients with previously drug-resistant tumors treated with 6-TG in the nonrandomized arm. In 16 patients failing 6-TG who then received 5-FU, there were no objective responses. Similarly, in patients failing 5-FU on this study who then received 6-TG, there were no responses in nine patients. Dose-limiting toxicity was observed in 40% to 51% of patients, and consisted of myelosuppression, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Patients were stratified for grade, size, extent of surgical margin, and soft tissue versus other sarcomas. Groups appeared balanced for histology and superficial versus deep lesions. Eight patients (19%) have died. Follow-up times range from two to 69 months (median, 16 months). Two patients receiving doxorubicin (10%) developed cardiotoxicity presenting as pulmonary edema. One patient returned to normal activity on digoxin and diuretics; the other (age, 28 years) died of intractable failure and arrhythmias after four weeks. While a nonsignificant difference in local control, metastasis- free survival, disease-free survival, and survival was observed for extremity lesions, the advantage may be outweighed by the risk of cardiotoxicity. Seventy-six percent of the control patients with extremity lesions remain disease free.

Dermatofibrosarcoma, lymphomas, myeloma, Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma, and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma were excluded as were patients with significant second primary cancers and those who received either preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy. After stratification by anatomic status of disease, site of origin, and histologic grade, a random one half of the 61 participants began alternating courses of vincristine/cyclophosphamide/dactinomycin, and vincristine/doxorubicin/dacarbazine at six-week intervals for one year. The control group was evaluated at six-week intervals without adjuvant chemotherapy, but these patients were offered this chemotherapy later if they had progressive disease excised. Although 30% of the 61 patients experienced local recurrence of disease within the first five years after randomization, and only 54% were continuously disease free for five or more years, 82% were surviving at five years (Kaplan-Meier calculations) with a median follow-up of 64.3 months. Partial suppression of distant metastasis by adjuvant chemotherapy was apparent in the overall study, in the extremity tumor category, and in the subgroup of patients who had received limb-sparing surgery; however, no survival advantage for chemotherapy-treated patients was demonstrated. The 30 adjuvant chemotherapy-treated patients received a total of three thoracotomies as compared with 17 salvage thoracotomies for the 31 control patients; however, salvage surgery for local recurrences has been similar in the two groups.

Findings at 72 months indicate that antiestrogen therapy (tamoxifen, Nolvadex) added to chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), methotrexate, and fluorouracil (5-Fluorouracil) (CMF) resulted in significant delayed recurrence in ER-positive postmenopausal patients, ER-positive patients with four or more positive nodes, and ER-positive patients with tumors greater than 3 cm in diameter.

Overall, Epi-DX + DTIC combination was well tolerated, thus permitting administration after a 3-week interval of the full drug dosages in all but two patients. No major cardiotoxicity was observed.

The patients were randomly assigned, with stratification by Clark&apos;s level, to receive either routine follow-up or immunotherapy with BCG, administered intradermally with a Heaf gun around the site of wide excision and then given orally for 2 years. Intradermal administration of BCG was repeated after 1 year&apos;s oral therapy with BCG. Of the 99 patients in the treatment group 66 had Clark&apos;s level 3, 28 had level 4, and 5 had level 5 invasion. Of the 100 patients in the control group, 61 had level 3, 36 had level 4, and 3 had level 5 invasion. Other prognostic factors, such as sex, depth of invasion, histologic features, site of disease and type of surgery, were evenly distributed. There were 57 recurrences of the melanoma, 24 in the treatment group and 33 in the control group. However, this trend was not statistically significant (p = 0.194). The suggestion that BCG may reduce the likelihood of local/regional recurrence has not been confirmed with longer follow-up. There were 13 such recurrences in the BCG group, compared with 21 in the control group; the proportions of patients in each group who had such a recurrence were not significantly different. Of the 199 patients 41 died, 24 in the control group and 17 in the treatment group; again, this difference was not significant.

Half of the patients also received a 6-month course of dimethyl triazeno imidazole carboxamide (DTIC) plus cyclophosphamide chemotherapy (each at 600 mg/m2 administered intravenously every 3 weeks for nine cycles) while the other half received no chemotherapy. Analysis of the data showed that adjuvant chemotherapy did not provide any demonstrable therapeutic effect, either in terms of disease-free survival or overall survival. No benefit was observed in subgroups of patients categorized by disease stage, site of metastasis, or sex. The drugs did cause a substantial rate of morbidity, however, since 42% of the patients had severe nausea and vomiting, while 13% had hair loss. The C. parvum was well tolerated in almost all patients. This is a particularly high-risk group for subsequent metastases since only 24% of the patients were free of disease for 1 year and 12% after 2 years.

Three arms of treatment were compared: DTIC alone, DTIC plus bacillus Calmette-Guerin, and DTIC plus Corynebacterium parvum. No significant difference in terms of complete response plus partial response was detected among the three regimens. Twenty-five patients (12.7%) responded with complete tumor regression, and 18 (9.3%) with partial regression. Complete plus partial responses were thus achieved in 22% of evaluable patients. Responders had a longer median survival than nonresponders. Overall median survival was 6 months. Brain metastases were detected in 17% of the patients. Median time from the beginning of treatment to the diagnosis of CNS involvement was 4 months.

Objective response rates were similar: 14% for dacarbazine and 10% for VBD. However, dacarbazine responses were associated with a trend toward longer progression-free intervals and longer survival. Toxicity was significantly greater in the VBD arm, and fatal in two patients. Dacarbazine was also associated with severe toxicity by the 10-day light-protected schedule used here.

There was no difference in response rate in the three groups (24%, 25% and 22%). Females responded better than males and, as expected, those with a better performance status responded more favorably than those with poor performance status. Patients whose primary site of melanoma was on the extremities did significantly better than those melanomas originating on the trunk or head and neck. Patients with lymphocyte counts greater than 2000/mm3 fared better than those with lymphopenia. Those responders who received high-dose DTIC plus actinomycin D had a significantly longer length of response than those receiving the immunotherapy limb. This was also true in those patients who had a prior disease-free interval of greater than 6 months before being placed in this study. Although there was no difference in survival from the start of treatment in all patients, those patients receiving high-dose DTIC plus actinomycin D and who had a prior disease-free interval of greater than 6 months, had significantly superior survival when compared to the immunotherapy limb. It is concluded that the addition of Levamisole to BHD does not improve response rate and may in certain subsets be detrimental to disease-free response and survival.

The patients in the second group (B, N = 53) received additional hyperthermic (42 C) perfusion with melphalan. The mean follow-up observation period was 554 days. We chose the disease-free survival time as the criterion for success. The study could be discontinued prematurely, since the intermediate evaluation revealed a highly significant difference between the groups (p = 0.0001). We observed 21 local recurrences in the control group and four recurrences in the perfusion group. The retrospective breakdown by clinical stages also showed significant differences.

In the perfusion group we observed recurrences equaling 5.6% in Stage I, 5.5% in Stage II, and 12.5% in Stage III. The differences between the groups based on the target-criterion of disease-free survival represent significance levels of p = 0.09 in Stage I, p = 0.03 in Stage II, and p = 0.003 in Stage III.

A larger proportion of patients in this arm survived one year or more. In addition, the 5-FU, Adriamycin, and mitomycin C program had the lowest rate of severe or worse toxicity of any of the treatments and was effective in patients who were less than fully ambulatory and in those who had lost weight. 5-Fluorouracil, Adriamycin, and mitomycin C appear to be a likely combination to be considered in a surgical adjuvant program</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="993"><COL><DATA> The FAM combination with the simultaneous administration of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C is considered standard chemotherapy for gastric adenocarcinoma.

To do so, the Southwest Oncology Group tested two schedules in a randomized study of 239 patients. Independent judgments of response were made by two authors with the same results. Equivalent response rates (23% of all eligible sequential and 30% simultaneous) and median survival durations (22 and 23 weeks, respectively) were seen. Patients with and without readily measurable tumors each lived a median of 22 weeks. Higher degrees of hematologic toxicity were associated with prolonged survival (median 27 weeks versus 20 weeks, p = 0.04). Patients treated by community oncologists were described as having higher response rates than those treated in major medical centers (64% versus 31%, p = 0.03).

Informed consent was obtained after randomization and only from the 39 randomized to treatment. Ten patients refused their treatment assignment. The five-year survival rate for patients randomized to treatment was 23%, and for those randomized to no treatment, 4% (P less than .05).

Thirty- nine percent of patients actually treated had a local-regional component of first clinical recurrence compared with 54% of those who received no treatment.

Seven of the second cancers were in situ, yielding an incidence of 3.7% invasive and 0.5% noninvasive cancers. Except for a peak of 1.75% in the second postoperative year, the annual incidence based on patients at risk was constant and less than 1%. Ninety-three percent of the second cancers occurred within 7 years and 80% within 5 years following mastectomy for the initial primary. All of the second cancers were regarded as being primarily of mammary origin exhibiting either: (1) an in situ component; (2) dissimilar but well-recognized patterns of primary breast cancers; or (3) the appearance of scar cancer, a recently described morphologic feature characteristically observed in some primary breast cancers. A search for factors that might be predictive of bilaterality was performed. Thirty-eight pathologic and eight clinical factors were assessed, including family history. Although the latter was 1.5 to 2 times more frequent in patients with bilateral disease, this estimate was not statistically significant. On the other hand, a statistically significant association with bilateral disease was found when the initial tumor measured more than 2.0 cm, was associated with invasive cancer or proliferative fibrocystic disease, nipple involvement, absent nodal sinus histiocytosis, lobular carcinoma in situ in the vicinity of the dominant mass, or was of the lobular invasive or tubular types. However, the degree of risk of these discriminants was no greater than 2 to 3:1. Despite the clinical scrutiny imposed by the NSABP protocol second tumors measured only 1 cm less than the first, measuring on average 2.4 cm, which reflects the difficulty attendant on the clinical detection of so-called early breast cancers. Yet, no significant difference in pathologic nodal status was noted between the first and second cancers or that of patients with unilateral disease.

Fifty-three patients admitted for colonic surgery were randomized to either GoLYTELY or a traditional 3-day bowel preparation. Both groups received oral and perioperative antibiotics. Pre- and postpreparation weights, blood chemistries, and hematologic values were obtained. Postpreparation patient tolerance was assessed. During surgery the surgeon scored the bowel for the presence of retained air, fluid, or feces. Standardized semiquantitative aerobic and anaerobic bacterial counts were obtained from sigmoid aspirates. Postoperative infectious complications were recorded. Mechanical preparation with GoLYTELY resulted in a greater feeling of fullness, while the traditional preparation produced more hunger and abdominal cramping. The use of GoLYTELY resulted in better scores of overall quality and bowel appearance, reflecting a greater efficiency with which it removed air, fluid, and feces from the bowel. GoLYTELY also resulted in significantly fewer total aerobic and anaerobic organisms in sigmoid aspirates.

Sixty-six patients with advanced primary colon or rectal cancer were randomized to receive 12 cycles with increasing dosages of intravenous (IV) or intraperitoneal (IP) 5-FU; the mean follow-up time was three years. The maximal tolerable dose and objective adverse side effects were prospectively recorded. The mean daily dose of 5-FU given by the IV route was 904 mg; for the IP route it was 1361 mg (p2 less than 0.0001). Two of ten patients had recurrent peritoneal carcinomatosis when treated with IP 5-FU; ten of eleven patients treated with IV 5-FU developed peritoneal implants (p2 less than 0.003). The incidence of serious complications was the same, but hematologic toxicity and hepatic toxicity were significantly reduced in patients who received IP 5-FU. When 5-FU is delivered by the IP route, the tolerable dose of drug was markedly increased without an increase in adverse side effects. The natural history of surgically treated disease was changed by reducing the incidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis but time to relapse and survival was not improved. IP 5-FU may be recommended for investigation in patients with perforated colon cancer, peritoneal implants, or as one part of a multimodality treatment protocol for colorectal cancer.

Overall, these patients were in very good general condition, with minimal symptoms. None had received any previous treatment with cytotoxic drugs. Vitamin C therapy showed no advantage over placebo therapy with regard to either the interval between the beginning of treatment and disease progression or patient survival.

Time to tumor recurrence differed significantly among the four treatment groups (P less than 0.04); it was significantly prolonged by combined radiation and chemotherapy as compared with resection alone (P less than 0.009). Overall survival did not differ significantly among the treatment groups. The superiority of the combined-modality regimen appeared to be attributable to the effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy in controlling local and distant recurrences, respectively. We conclude that this study provides evidence supporting the use of postoperative radiation therapy in conjunction with chemotherapy in patients who have had &quot;curative&quot; resection of rectal cancer with involvement of perirectal fat or regional nodes or both (Stages B2 and C)</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="416"><COL><DATA> Three hundred thirty-five previously untreated patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma were randomly assigned to treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) alone, 5-FU plus N-(phosphonacetyl)-L-aspartic acid (PALA), 5-FU plus high-dose thymidine, 5-FU plus levamisole, or 5-FU plus methyl CCNU, vincristine, and streptozotocin (MOF-Strept). Dosages were designed to produce definite toxicity in the majority of patients, although the nature of dose-limiting reactions varied considerably among regimens. 5-FU alone and 5-FU plus levamisole produced mucocutaneous reactions, diarrhea, and leukopenia; 5-FU plus PALA produced primarily mucocutaneous reactions and diarrhea; 5-FU plus thymidine produced leukopenia with occasional neurotoxicity and hypotension; and MOF-Strept produced substantial nausea and vomiting with both thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Objective response rates among patients with measurable disease varied from 12% (5-FU plus PALA) to 34% (MOF-Strept), but none of the regimens were significantly superior to 5-FU alone. Both interval to progression and survival were comparable among the five regimens with no reasonable chance that any combination regimen could produce as much as a 50% improvement when compared with 5-FU alone. Whereas we observed definite modulation of 5-FU dose--toxicity relationships, particularly with the thymidine and PALA combinations, this did not result in a detectable improvement in therapeutic effect. None of the combination regimens, administered in the dosages and schedules we used, can be recommended as standard therapy of advanced colorectal carcinoma</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="419"><COL><DATA> Between 1980 and 1983, 373 patients with clinically resectable rectal adenocarcinoma entered a prospective randomized study aimed to evaluate the effect of short-term preoperative radiotherapy. Protocol violations were identified in 21 instances. Of the remaining 352 patients, 182 were randomized to surgical treatment only (S-group). Immediately, before surgery, 170 patients were irradiated to the pelvic region with 25 Gy (2500 rad) during a 5-day period (RT-group). Of these patients, 59% underwent abdominoperineal excision, 38% anterior resection, and 3% laparotomy only. At surgery distant metastases were discovered in 32 patients (9%). There were no significant differences between the groups in the distribution of age, sex, operative methods, and tumor stage according to the original Dukes&apos; classification. During the follow-up time, ranging between 6 months and 3 years, tumor recurrence occurred in 35 patients, 19 in the S-group and 16 in the RT-group. Fifteen patients in the S-group had pelvic recurrence compared to 10 patients in the RT-group. Distant metastases occurred in six and eight patients, respectively. Two patients in each group had both pelvic and distant recurrence. There was no correlation between tumor recurrence and type of operation. Median time interval from diagnosis to pelvic recurrence was 10 months in the S-group and 16 months in the RT-group. Postoperative complications in the form of wound sepsis were slightly more common in the RT-group. In summary, the applied treatment regimen, is well-tolerated and apparently does not affect the Dukes&apos; stage of the tumor.

Four hundred ten patients were allocated to be treated either by surgery alone or by 34.5 Gy of radiotherapy (in 19 days overall) followed by surgery. The tolerance of the adjuvant radiation therapy was fairly good. The 5-year survival rate was 65% overall and showed no difference between both therapeutic regimens. Similarly, the metastases-free rate was the same in both groups. In contrast, the preoperative radiation therapy showed a marked effect on local control of the disease, the comparison of the time to local recurrence being highly significant between the two treatment groups (P = 0.001).

The distribution of prognostic variables was similar in both groups indicating the absence of any bias and the efficacy of the randomization. Disease-free interval and survival time were analysed as end points. After 5 years of follow-up of all patients there was no significant difference between treatment or placebo group in the total material or the subgroups regarding either of the end points.

Patients with transmural extension of tumor or nodal metastases were randomized into groups treated by resection alone (control) or resection plus ASI. With a mean follow-up of 28 months (range, 14-24), only 3 of 20 treatment patients had recurrences and none have died, whereas 9 of 20 control patients had recurrences and 4 died.

There was a highly significant reduction in perineal wound infection in the PVP-I group (P less than 0.01) and this was true even if perineal wound contamination had occurred during operation (P less than 0.05). Primary wound healing was significantly improved in the treatment group (P less than 0.02) and this was found also in the presence of contamination (P less than 0.005).

Although the difference was not significant, there was a trend of improved survival for the patients with resection plus pump. For the patients with unresectable disease, those patients with positive portal nodes had poor survival matching those patients with extra hepatic metastases. Patients with unresectable disease treated with pump had a 73% therapeutic response rate and a median survival of 22 months.

The primary aim of the trial is to investigate whether local recurrence rate differs between the two groups, and a secondary aim is to see whether 5-year survival will differ between the two groups of patients. Up to October 1984, 360 patients have been randomly allocated to these two groups. Locally curative surgery has been performed in 161 patients in the pre-operative irradiation group and in 152 patients in the postoperative irradiation group. Pre-operative irradiation was extremely well tolerated and there were no irradiation-related complications; 95 per cent of these patients received their treatment according to the intended schedule. However, 48 of the 161 patients had a tumour in Dukes&apos; stage A. Pre-operative radiotherapy had no impact on postoperative mortality or the occurrence of anastomosis dehiscence, but significantly more patients with perineal wound sepsis after an abdominoperineal resection were found in the group of patients receiving pre-operative radiotherapy. This prolonged the stay in hospital after surgery. Postoperative radiotherapy was not so well tolerated as pre-operative treatment, and in a substantial number of patients the treatment could not be commenced until a relatively long time after surgery. To date, the local recurrence rate is acceptably low (approximately 10 per cent) in both treatment groups</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="474"><COL><DATA> Preoperative mechanical bowel preparation, peroperative topical antiseptic measures, and postoperative antibiotic therapy have all been shown to reduce infection after colorectal surgery.

All patients had mechanical bowel preparation, preoperative topical povidone-iodine and per and postoperative antibiotics. Of 22 study patients only one (4.6%) developed abdominal wound infection, whereas in 23 controls nine (39.1%) did so (P less than 0.01). In three of the study patients cultures of swabs taken at operation from the transected bowel ends showed no bacterial growth.

An initial field received 4,500-5,100 rad in 5-6 weeks, with a boost field dose to a maximum of 7000 rad/8 weeks (maximum 6,000 rad/7 weeks with chemotherapy), dependent on findings of special small bowel films. One hundred twenty-nine patients were evaluable (65 XRT, 64 XRT + chemo). There were no statistically significant differences between treatments with respect to overall survival, complete remission rate, time to disease progression, local failure rate, or radiation dose distribution. Median survival was 17 months for XRT, 18 months for XRT + chemo; the 2-year survival probability was 36% for XRT, 44% for XRT + chemo. Initial performance status was a significant prognostic factor for both survival and time to disease progression. A trend was observed favoring the combination treatment for patients with residual disease. Treatment complications were greater for the combined modality arm than for radiation alone. Twenty-seven patients (22%) were alive at last data analysis, with no evidence of disease (NED) from 2-51 months (30 months median).

The natural history of surgically treated disease was changed by reducing the incidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis, but time to relapse and survival was not improved.

Randomization criteria (age, sex, Dukes&apos; stage, localization of tumour, operative procedure) were evenly distributed throughout the groups. After a median observation time of 30 months, statistical analyses were performed: survival and probability to be free of recurrence was described by Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival function; for comparison of these survival functions, Breslow&apos;s test was used. Overall analyses show no benefit in the treatment group compared to controls. Separate analyses by Dukes&apos; stages showed that in patients with Dukes&apos; C tumours the probability of survival 40 months after surgery was 72 per cent in group C, 51 per cent in group B, and 33 per cent in group A.

No patients was lost to follow-up, which ranged from 11 to 85 months (median 29 months). All patients received radiotherapy and some received postoperative chemotherapy (doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and high-dose methotrexate). A subset of 15 patients were entered into a prospective, randomized study testing the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy (eight received chemotherapy; seven did not). Two-year actuarial survival rates were inferior in the chemotherapy arm (100% versus 47%; p = 0.06), but the small number of patients precluded drawing definitive conclusions from this randomized study alone. Among the entire 37 patients (21 received chemotherapy; 16 did not) the actuarial 3-year survival rate was 43% and appeared unaffected by chemotherapy. Two patients suffered doxorubicin infiltration, three sustained cardiac toxicity, two developed cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis, and three withstood transient, severe bone marrow suppression. Eight patients suffered severe radiation enteritis, and one patient died after bowel resection for this problem. Thus the chemotherapy regimen we administered did not appear to improve survival but was associated with major morbidity. Radiotherapy was also associated with major complications, and since all patients received radiotherapy, it remains to be established if this modality is beneficial in improving survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="544"><COL><DATA> Since 1977, 31 patients were entered in a randomized, prospective study testing the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy after aggressive local treatment of high-grade sarcomas of the head, neck, breast, and trunk (excluding retroperitoneal sarcomas). All patients had complete resection of gross tumor and underwent postoperative radiotherapy (6000- 6300 rads over 7-8 weeks). Seventeen patients received adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin (less than or equal to 550 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (less than or equal to 5500 mg/m2), and methotrexate (less than or equal to 1000 mg/kg). Three-year actuarial disease-free survival in the chemotherapy arm was 77%, compared to 49% in the no-chemotherapy arm (P = 0.075). Three-year overall actuarial survivals in the two treatment arms, however, were 68% and 58%, respectively (P = 0.38). Considering only patients with tumors of the trunk (22 patients), 3-year actuarial disease-free survival in the chemotherapy arm was 92%, compared to 47% in the no-chemotherapy arm (P = 0.006). Actuarial 3-year overall survival in the chemotherapy arm was 82%, compared to 61% in the no-chemotherapy arm (P = 0.18). An additional 26 patients were treated in an identical fashion, but were not part of the randomized trial because of contraindications to chemotherapy, refusal to enter the randomized trial, or because they were treated before 1977 in a trial in which all patients received chemotherapy. Considering the entire group of 57 patients, follow-up ranged from 10 to 86 months (median, 35 months). Local control was achieved in 46 patients (81%); 3-year actuarial disease-free and overall survivals were 67% and 77%, respectively. A tendency toward improved disease-free survival was apparent among patients treated with chemotherapy (P = 0.018), but there was no statistically significant improvement in overall actuarial survival (P = 0.46). The subgroup of patients with sarcomas of the trunk (39 patients) demonstrated the greatest benefit from chemotherapy, with regard to disease-free survival (P less than or equal to 0.001). The most significant toxicity associated with chemotherapy was doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy, which resulted in clinically apparent congestive heart failure in five patients.

Immunotherapy with BCG vaccinations had no discernible effect on disease-free survival.  Estrogen receptor measurements in the primary tumor provide important prognostic information regardless of treatment.

Of 52 evaluable patients, 25% (six of 24) treated with epirubicin, and 25% (seven of 28) treated with doxorubicin experienced major therapeutic responses. The median duration of response to epirubicin was 11.9 months compared to 7.1 months with doxorubicin. Cardiotoxicity was monitored by serial multigated radionuclide cineangiocardiography performed at rest and after exercise. Laboratory evidence of cardiotoxicity was defined as a decrease in resting left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 10% from the baseline value, or a decrease of 5% or greater with exercise compared with the resting study performed on the same day. Fifteen patients treated with epirubicin and 18 patients treated with doxorubicin had at least two determinations of left ventricular ejection fraction and were evaluable for laboratory cardiotoxicity. Using methods of survival analysis, the median doses to the development of laboratory cardiotoxicity were estimated to be 935 mg/m2 of epirubicin and 468 mg/m2 of doxorubicin. Four patients treated with epirubicin and five treated with doxorubicin developed symptomatic congestive heart failure. The median cumulative dose at which congestive heart failure occurred was 1,134 mg/m2 of epirubicin compared with 492 mg/m2 of doxorubicin.

In histologically node-positive patients, there appeared to be prolonged survival for women treated with quadrantectomy (82% versus 70%), although this difference was not statistically significant.  it is concluded that for patients meeting the eligibility criteria of this study, there is no demonstrable disadvantage for the use of quadrantectomy, axillary node dissection, and radiotherapy to the ipsilateral breast.  </DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="660"><COL><DATA> A prospective multicenter trial was conducted in 155 consecutive patients with Stage IV breast cancer randomly allocated to receive either (1) vincristin (V) 1.2 mg/m2 (maximum dose, 2 mg), Adriamycin (A) (doxorubicin) 40 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide (C) 500 mg/m2, all intravenously on day 1, every 4 weeks, in combination with medroxyprogesteron acetate (MPA) 600 mg orally on days 1 through 14, 500 mg intramuscularly on days 1 through 28, and twice weekly afterwards (combined chemoendocrine approach) or (2) the same combination chemotherapy (VAC) for three cycles alternating with MPA in the above-mentioned dosage during 8 weeks (alternating chemoendocrine approach). Results show an overall response rate of 73% with 26% complete responses in the combined treatment arm, whereas in the alternating arm, an overall response rate of 76% with 20% complete responses was observed. In patients with more than one metastatic site, response rate was higher in the combination treatment, and only in this arm were complete responses observed in these patients. Although the median duration of response was long in both treatment arms (combination, 19 months versus alternating, 21 months), the median overall survival in both groups was not definitely prolonged (22 versus 24 months, respectively). However, results in subsets of patients suggest that the alternating chemoendocrine approach may be better for estrogen receptor (ER)-negative patients, for patients younger than 51 years of age, and for patients with a disease-free interval of 1 year or less. Patients with these parameters probably belong to the same population. It is concluded that combination of chemotherapy and high-dose MPA may be indicated in ER-positive patients when a clinical response is urgently needed. In ER-negative patients, the alternating use of both treatment modalities deserves further investigation</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="661"><COL><DATA> Data are presented from a prospective clinical trial in which 1,891 patients with histologically confirmed stage II breast cancer were randomized to receive adjuvant therapy consisting of l-phenylalanine mustard and 5-fluorouracil (PF) with and without tamoxifen (T).  The findings indicate that the benefit previously noted for the addition of tamoxifen at 2 and 3 years&apos; mean follow-up is still apparent at 4 years.  Although the tamoxifen-containing regimen prolongs disease-free survival and survival, this effect is not uniform and is dependent on patient age and tumor receptor content.  Only those patients &gt;= 50 years of age demonstrated a benefit from the addition of tamoxifen to chemotherapy.,  The benefit was influenced by the degree of quantitative tumor receptor content.  Patients &lt;=49 years of age failed to demonstrate a prolongation in disease-free survival with tamoxifen even when the tumor estrogen receptor content was &gt;=100 fmol.  Not only was there no benefit attributable to tamoxifen in patients &lt;= 49 years, if the tumor progesterone receptors were &lt; 10 fmol there was a significant diminution in disease-free survival and survival.  The results continue to indicate that the response to PFT therapy is heterogeneous in that only specific patient subsets demonstrate a salutary effect.  Whether this phenomenon of heterogeneity is unique to the PFT combination or is an intrinsic biological property of stage II breast cancer remains to be ascertained.</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="786"><COL><DATA> After hysterectomy, 156 evaluable patients with stage I (limited to the corpus) or stage II (limited to the corpus and cervix) uterine sarcomas were randomly assigned to adjuvant chemotherapy with Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, Ohio) for six months or to no further treatment. Pelvic irradiation (external or intracavitary) was optional before randomization. Of 75 patients receiving Adriamycin, 31 have suffered recurrences compared with 43 of 81 receiving no adjuvant chemotherapy. This difference is not statistically significant. Moreover, there is no difference in progression-free interval or survival. The optional radiotherapy did not influence the outcome although there was a suggestion that vaginal recurrence was decreased by pelvic radiotherapy. The recurrence rates in specific cell types (leiomyosarcoma, homologous mixed mesodermal sarcoma, or heterologous mixed mesodermal sarcoma) were not significantly different although the pattern of recurrence differed, with pulmonary metastases being more common in leiomyosarcoma and extrapulmonary recurrence being more common in mixed mesodermal sarcoma.

There is no reasonable likelihood that either the FA or FAM regimen could produce a meaningful survival advantage over fluorouracil alone. Interval to disease progression, objective response rates, and palliative effects (improved performance, body weight, or symptoms) were essentially equivalent among the three regimens. With regard to toxicity, the FAM regimen produced more anorexia, nausea, vomiting, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and cumulative bone marrow suppression.

The operation removes only sufficient tissue to ensure that margins of resected specimens are free of tumor. Women were randomly assigned to total mastectomy, segmental mastectomy alone, or segmental mastectomy followed by breast irradiation. All patients had axillary dissections, and patients with positive nodes received chemotherapy. Life-table estimates based on data from 1843 women indicated that treatment by segmental mastectomy, with or without breast irradiation, resulted in disease-free, distant- disease-free, and overall survival at five years that was no worse than that after total breast removal. In fact, disease-free survival after segmental mastectomy plus radiation was better than disease-free survival after total mastectomy (P = 0.04), and overall survival after segmental mastectomy, with or without radiation, was better than overall survival after total mastectomy (P = 0.07, and 0.06, respectively). A total of 92.3 per cent of women treated with radiation remained free of breast tumor at five years, as compared with 72.1 per cent of those receiving no radiation (P less than 0.001). Among patients with positive nodes 97.9 per cent of women treated with radiation and 63.8 per cent of those receiving no radiation remained tumor-free (P less than 0.001), although both groups received chemotherapy.

Four hundred ninety-seven evaluable patients have been accrued on this study. The response rates were 20.7%, 31.4%, and 25.0%, for regimens 1, 2, and 3, respectively; the complete remission rates were 10.0%, 12.7%, and 8.6% for regimens 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The median duration of response ranged from 3.9 to 4.8 months, the median progression-free interval from 3.7 to 4.6 months, and the median survival time from 6.1 to 7.1 months. The difference in response rates for regimens 1 and 2 is statistically significant (P = .015) but less than the magnitude originally considered clinically significant. The differences in complete remission rates, response duration, progression-free interval, and survival times are not statistically significant.

There were no significant differences among three groups of patients with clinically negative axillary nodes, with respect to disease-free survival, distant-disease-- free survival, or overall survival (about 57 per cent) at 10 years. The patients were treated by radical mastectomy, total (&quot;simple&quot;) mastectomy without axillary dissection but with regional irradiation, or total mastectomy without irradiation plus axillary dissection only if nodes were subsequently positive. Similarly, no differences were observed between patients with clinically positive nodes treated by radical mastectomy or by total mastectomy without axillary dissection but with regional irradiation. Survival at 10 years was about 38 per cent in both groups. Our findings indicate that the location of a breast tumor does not influence the prognosis and that irradiation of internal mammary nodes in patients with inner-quadrant lesions does not improve survival. The data also demonstrate that the results obtained at five years accurately predict the outcome at 10 years.

This report presents life table probabilities, cumulative odds ratios, and P values for disease-free survival (DFS) and survival at yearly intervals through 5 years of observation (mean time on study, 72 months). When patients were examined overall without regard for any discriminant associated with outcome, ie, age, number of positive nodes, or tumor receptor status, there was a significant prolongation of DFS (P = .002), but not survival through the fifth postoperative year. The benefit was almost entirely restricted to those greater than or equal to 50 years with greater than or equal to 4 positive nodes. In that group there was a 66% greater chance of remaining disease free if PFT was received (P less than .001), and there was also a significant survival benefit (P = .02). The advantage from PFT was found to be associated with tumor estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) as well as patient age and nodal status. Overall there was a significant improvement in DFS from PFT in those having tumors with an ER or PR level greater than or equal to 10 femtomole (fmol) (P = .01 and .009, respectively). No significant benefit in DFS or survival has been observed in patients less than or equal to 49 years old related either to nodes or tumor receptor status. Survival continues to be adversely affected by TAM in those patients (less than or equal to 49 years old), particularly when their tumors have a PR of 0 to 9 fmol (P = .007). In patients greater than or equal to 50 years old with four or more positive nodes, a significant DFS benefit persisted through the fifth year of observation in those having tumor ER or PR levels greater than 10 fmol (P less than .001 and .002). The advantage was observed in patients 50 to 59 years old as well as those 60 to 70. Women in the older decade demonstrated some advantage from PFT when their tumor ER or PR was 0 to 9 fmol.

The results were, briefly, as follows: The incidence of leukopenia was significantly lower in the groups receiving MPA in patients with breast and colorectal cancer (P less than 0.02). Tumors of the lung and other solid forms showed no such difference. The incidence of thrombocytopenia was the same in all disease groups.

The overall mean dose of drug administered by the i.p. route (1,479 mg) was significantly greater than given i.v. (1,019 mg), as it was for each treatment cycle.

The most frequent symptom reported by all patients was fatigue. Even though i.v. 5-FU dose was titrated to reduce toxicity, the nadir leukocyte count was suppressed over all cycles. The total numbers of immediate and delayed serious complications that resulted from i.v. or i.p. 5-FU were similar, although the nature of these complications differed markedly between the two routes of drug administration. Failure to complete 5-FU chemotherapy was significantly more common if patients received i.v. 5-FU plus pelvic irradiation.

One hundred twenty-six patients are evaluable for response. Of 62 patients treated with MMF, one (2%) achieved complete remission, and three (5%) attained partial remission. Of 64 patients treated with 5-FU, two (3%) achieved complete remission, and eight (13%) attained partial remission. The median survival for patients receiving MMF was 9.5 months compared with 10.3 months for patients receiving 5-FU. The survival distributions for the two regimens were not significantly different, either unadjusted or adjusted for pretreatment characteristics. Performance status and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) were both significantly associated with survival. Patients with liver metastases only and normal liver function tests had a median survival of 19.8 months and a 40% response rate.

It remains, however, to be unequivocally demonstrated that sphincter preservation has not resulted in compromised local disease control, disease-free survival, and survival. Accordingly, it is the specific aim of this endeavor to compare local recurrence, disease-free survival, and survival in patients with Dukes&apos; B and C rectal cancer undergoing curative abdominoperineal resection or sphincter-saving resection. For the purpose of this study, 232 patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection and 181 subjected to sphincter-saving resections were available for analysis from an NSABP randomized prospective clinical trial designed to ascertain the efficacy of adjuvant therapy in rectal carcinoma (protocol R-01). The mean time on study was 48 months. Analyses were carried out comparing the two operations according to Dukes&apos; class, the number of positive nodes, and tumor size. The only significant differences in disease-free survival and survival were observed for the cohort characterized by greater than 4 positive nodes and were in favor of patients treated with sphincter-saving resections. A patient undergoing sphincter-saving resection was 0.62 times as likely to sustain a treatment failure as a similar patient undergoing abdominoperineal resection (p = 0.07) and 0.49 times as likely to die (p = 0.02). The inability to demonstrate an attenuated disease-free survival and survival for patients treated with sphincter-saving resection was in spite of an increased incidence of local recurrence (anastomotic and pelvic) observed for the latter operation when compared to abdominoperineal resection (13% vs. 5%). A similar analysis evaluating the length of margins of resection in patients undergoing sphincter-preserving operations indicated that treatment failure and survival were not significantly different in patients whose distal resection margins were less than 2 cm, 2-2.9 cm, or greater than or equal to 3 cm. If any trend was observed, it appeared that patients with smaller resection margins had a slightly prolonged survival (p = 0.10). This observation was present in spite of the fact that local recurrence as a first site of treatment failure was greater in the group with less than 2 cm that it was in the greater than or equal to 3 cm category, 22% versus 12%. This increased local recurrence rate in the population with smaller margins was not translated into an in crease in overall treatment failure and had absolutely no influence on survival. It is suggested that local recurrence serves as a marker of distant disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="542"><COL><DATA> A new trial for evaluating the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy in high-grade soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremities in adult patients is presented.

The preliminary results of the study are reported at a median observation period of 27.6 months. Of the 59 patients who entered the study, 79.1% in the chemotherapy group are without sign of disease, whereas the corresponding figure in the nonadjuvant chemotherapy group is 54.3%.

The virtual identity of these two protocols permits their combination for analysis. A total of 75 patients (42 men, 33 women) with soft-tissue sarcoma (stages IIB to IVA) were randomized, after receiving optimal regional therapy, to receive either doxorubicin hydrochloride (450 mg/m2) (37 patients) or observation (38 patients). Follow-up has ranged from 16 to 80 months (median, 49 months). Twenty-five patients (33%) died, and two patients receiving doxorubicin developed cardiotoxicity. No significant differences in local control, metastasis-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival were observed for the two treatment arms.

An objective response was obtained in 31 and 35% of patients in the two groups. There was no significant difference with regard to duration of response or survival. Weekly low dose Adriamycin was well tolerated. When subjective side effects occurred, they were usually slight and transient. In approx. 40% of the patients no side-effects at all were observed. Eight per cent had alopecia requiring a wig. Only slight myelosuppression could be seen in a few patients and this had no practical implications. Most or all of VAC patients experienced severe toxicity with regard to nausea, vomiting and alopecia. Also myelosuppression was more pronounced among VAC patients. It is concluded that weekly doses of Adriamycin as single agent therapy for advanced breast cancer is as effective as the VAC combination delivered every third week, with considerably less toxicity</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="626"><COL><DATA> Ninety-seven eligible and evaluable women with metastatic breast cancer were placed on a prospective clinical protocol to evaluate the use of continuous cyclic therapy with dibromodulcitol, doxorubicin, vincristine, tamoxifen, and fluoxymesterone (DAVTH) v DAVTH alternating with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and prednisone (CMFP); and the use of pretreatment and serial carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in these patients. Continuous DAVTH and DAVTH/CMFP were equivalent therapies with respect to response rates, time to treatment failure (TTF), and survival. Pretreatment CEA levels were elevated (greater than 5 ng/mL) in 42/97 patients and less than 5 ng/mL in the remaining patients. Patients with elevated pretreatment CEA levels were more likely to be estrogen receptor (ER) positive (P = .006), to have prolonged disease-free intervals (P = .017), to have hepatic (P = .004) and/or osseous (P = .01) metastases, and to have multiple sites of metastatic disease (P = .004). Pretreatment CEA levels did not significantly predict for overall response rates, TTF, or survival; nonetheless, those patients with low pretreatment CEA levels had more complete responses (CRs) (16/55 v 4/42; P = .02). Serial CEA levels during therapy revealed a number of interesting patterns. During the first 4 months of treatment, serial CEA levels in responding patients either (1) progressively declined (15/29 women with elevated pretreatment CEA levels), or (2) initially rose significantly (mean, 243% of pretreatment value) and then declined (14/29 women with elevated pretreatment CEA levels). Peak CEA levels in the latter patients were seen 27 to 135 days following initiation of cytotoxic therapy. In some patients the initial increase in the CEA level was incorrectly interpreted as evidence of impending disease progression. CEA levels frequently increased around the time of clinical disease progression. However, rising CEA levels rarely provided a clinically meaningful lead time before the appearance of other clinical evidence of disease progression. These data suggest that routine pretreatment and monthly serial CEA levels in metastatic breast cancer patients have minimal use in clinical practice. Two further noteworthy findings were observed in this prospective study. First, patients with an unknown ER status had a prolonged median survival when compared with patients with ER positive or negative tumors; this appeared to be related to prolonged disease-free intervals in ER unknown patients. Second, two case of secondary acute leukemia were seen in patients treated with continuous DAVTH therapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="634"><COL><DATA> Ninety patients with breast cancer refractory to cyclophosphamide/fluorouracil/methotrexate (CMF) have been randomized in their treatment, receiving either doxorubicin or mitoxantrone. Seventy-nine have received two full courses of therapy. Twelve of the 40 (30%) who initially received doxorubicin responded, whereas eight of the 47 (17%) who received mitoxantrone responded. These rates are not statistically different. The degree of myelosuppression was equivalent. Patients who received mitoxantrone had less nausea, vomiting, alopecia, and fatigue. Controllable clinical congestive heart failure developed in seven patients, and four others had a deterioration of noninvasive measures of cardiac function without clinical failure. One patient with clinical heart failure developing received only doxorubicin and one, only mitoxantrone, whereas the others received both agents. The duration of remission and time lapsed before disease progression were almost identical for the two regimens. This study included a crossover design. Two of 22 (10%) patients receiving doxorubicin and five of 24 (21%) receiving mitoxantrone as secondary therapy responded. This suggests that there is not absolute cross-resistance between these agents.

A prospective randomized study was done at our institution from 1961 to 1966 to test the value of prophylactic oophorectomy in the treatment of carcinoma of the breast. The patients have now been studied for 17 to 22 years. Patients were randomized into two groups: a control group and a group treated by surgical castration. By December 1983 280 patients were evaluable, 154 in the control group and 126 in the oophorectomy group. One hundred and forty-nine patients died during the observation time. All but 11 patients underwent autopsy. There are no significant differences between the group regarding age, axillary node involvement, menstrual status, perinodal tumor growth and distribution in the different TNM stages. The results of the study did not demonstrate any significant differences in cure rate, survival time, recurrence free intervals or intervals between recurrence of the disease and death. The results were independent of nodal status, TNM classification and menstrual status of the patient. These findings do not support the use of prophylactic oophorectomy in the treatment of operable carcinoma of the breast in TNM Stages I and II, whereas no conclusion can be drawn regarding TNM Stage III as the number of patients in this stage is small</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="744"><COL><DATA> Adult/Aged/Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/mo [Mortality]/Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/su [Surgery]/Carcinoma,Hepatocellular/th [Therapy]/Clinical Trials/Combined Modality Therapy/Hepatic Artery/su [Surgery]/Human/Ligation/Liver Neoplasms/mo [Mortality]/Liver Neoplasms/su [Surgery]/Liver Neoplasms/th [Therapy]/Middle Age/Palliative Care/Random Allocation</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="785"><COL><DATA> From November 1973 through July 1982, 225 women with Stage I or II uterine sarcoma were entered on a protocol which evaluated the use of doxorubicin in the adjuvant setting.

Other clinical features were well balanced for each group. C. parvum, 2 mg/m2 IV was repeated eight times at three weekly intervals. The schedule was based on previous work which indicated significant increase in killer cell activity. There was no serious toxicity and 22 patients exhibited tachyphylaxis. Seventeen patients in the control group (11 tumour free) are alive at 24-80 months, and 20 patients in the C. parvum group (12 tumour free) are alive 24-76 months from randomization.

No significant difference was found among the three treatment groups with respect to survival or metastasis-free survival. Multifactorial analysis indicated that the level of invasion and the thickness of the lesion were the most important prognostic factors, followed by age (60 years or older), site (legs), and tumor type (nodular). A prognostic index based on these variables was highly predictive of metastasis or death. Even when this score was considered, no significant variation was noted among the three treatment groups. More subsequent complications of melanoma, however, occurred in the group with no lymphadenectomy--36 in this group but only 19 in each of the other treatment groups. This finding was not statistically significant but does indicate that a few additional problems may be associated with leaving regional nodes intact.

The 187 evaluable patients were initially stratified according to the presence of measurable or evaluable disease and performance status. There was a significantly higher response rate observed for FAB (40%) compared with doxorubicin (13%) among the 145 measurable-disease patients. Duration of response and survival were significantly longer for FAB in the measurable-disease group, but for the total patient population an early advantage for FAB in time to disease progression and survival was lost with continued follow-up. Median survival was 33 weeks for patients receiving FAB and 19 weeks for those receiving doxorubicin. Significant pretreatment factors adversely affecting survival included poor performance status, weight loss of greater than 10%, and more than two sites of metastases. Toxicity was not severe in either treatment arm, and only thrombocytopenia occurred significantly more often with FAB.

Single agent 5-fluorouracil (FUra) given by intensive-course rapid intravenous administration serves as a control. Included among the experimental treatments are two regimens consisting of FUra plus leucovorin (folinic acid). One of these regimens uses folinic acid at a dose level of 200 mg/m2 daily for 5 days based on earlier studies by Machover et al. (4). The second regimen uses folinic acid at 1/10 the dose level (20 mg/m2 daily for 5 days), since this lower dose of folinic acid has been shown to produce peak serum levels equivalent to the concentration of folinic acid required in culture medium to produce optimal inhibition of L1210 cells by FUra in vitro, and because of the great expense of folinic acid when given at the higher dose levels. As of January 1986, 78 patients had been randomized to receive treatment with FUra alone or one of the FUra-folinic acid regimens. The toxicity of the folinic acid regimens has been clinically tolerable, with stomatitis and, to a lesser extent, diarrhea being dose-limiting. Hematologic toxicity has been very mild. There is suggestive evidence that folinic acid given at the higher dose level in combination with FUra at a constant dose produces more severe effects on the oropharyngeal mucosa.

We have investigated the effects of postoperative TPN on the complication rate in 92 patients after major colorectal surgery for carcinoma of the large bowel or inflammatory bowel disease in a controlled, randomised study. The complication rate was analysed against seven commonly used nutritional (biochemical and anthropometric) variables and against the diagnosis, clinical inflammatory activity and presence of pre-operative septic complication. Patients were randomly allocated to postoperative TPN or conventional fluid and electrolyte support. The results show no correlation between the complication rate and the nutritional and clinical state of the patients as assessed pre-operatively. The complication rate was not significantly reduced by postoperative TPN. This study indicates that biochemical and anthropometric nutritional variables do not identify patients at risk to develop postoperative complications. The presence of pre-operative complications showed a marginal correlation with postoperative morbidity, in agreement with previous experience.

Patients were stratified according to performance status, anatomic site of primary indicator lesion, and prior chemotherapy. Those with abnormal kidney or liver function were randomized between FMI and FMV because triazinate depends on both hepatic and renal mechanisms for elimination. There were no significant differences between the treatment regimens in objective response rate (11%-17%), interval to progression (median, 10-14 weeks), or survival (median, 5-6 months). The primary side effect observed was hematologic toxicity, which tended to increase in severity with repeated courses of therapy. Although ICRF-159 and triazinate have been shown to have limited single-agent phase II activity against colorectal cancer in previous trials, neither agent combined with 5-fluorouracil plus methyl CCNU has an improved treatment effect compared with FMV.

The relative reduction rate was similar among patients with Dukes&apos; A, B, and C tumors. No significant differences between the treatment groups were observed with regard to frequency of distant metastasis or survival. The postoperative mortality--defined as death within 30 days of surgery--was 7% in the radiotherapy group as compared to 2% in the group randomized to surgery only (p less than 0.01). This mortality mainly occurred among patients aged above 75 years, and the difference between the groups may have been due to the fact that the irradiated volume was fairly large.

Of 125 eligible patients, 62 were randomized to receive bolus FA (200 mg/m2 days 1 through 4) in addition to 5-FU (1,000 mg/m2 days 1 through 4) by continuous four-day infusion (infusion arm), while 63 were randomized to receive bolus FA (200 mg/m2 days 1 through 5) in addition to 5-FU (325 mg/m2 days 1 through 5) by bolus injection (bolus arm). The toxicities of the two schedules differed, with stomatitis being more severe in the infusion arm and leukopenia being more severe in the bolus arm. The response rates and survival data for the two arms are nearly identical. The median survival of patients on the infusion arm is 11.0 months and of patients on the bolus arm, 10.3 months. The infusion arm produced one complete response (CR) and 12 partial responses (PRs), for a major response rate of 21% of eligible patients. The bolus arm produced three CRs and 11 PRs, for a major response rate of 22% of eligible patients.

No tumour responses were seen and toxicity was unacceptable. In the second study, 29 patients received IFN in two similar schedules, but the dose of IFN was reduced to 20 X 10(6) U/m2 per day in the intravenous arm and to 5 X 10(6) U/m2 per day in the subcutaneous arm.

However, the improved response rate for patients in whom I.A. therapy was used did not translate to a significantly improved survival rate. The 2-year actuarial survival rates for the groups for which I.A. and I.V. therapy was used were 22% and 15% respectively, with the survival curves not differing significantly (p = 0.27). These results may have been due to the inclusion of patients with tumor in draining hepatic lymph nodes. The presence of tumor in hepatic lymph nodes was associated with a poorer prognosis. Analysis of a subgroup of patients with negative hepatic lymph nodes suggested an improved actuarial survival rate in patients for whom I.A. versus I.V. therapy was used (p less than 0.03). The toxicity of I.A. FUDR was considerable, and side effects included chemical hepatitis (79%), biliary sclerosis (21%), peptic ulcers (17%), and gastritis/duodenitis (21%). The only major effect of toxicity of I.V. FUDR was severe diarrhea (59%). Regional I.A.

The trial is unique in that it is nationwide and based on a nonselected population of patients, and is the only adjuvant trial studying the effect of cyclophosphamide monotherapy. After total mastectomy with axillary node sampling, followed by local radiotherapy, 1,032 pre- and perimenopausal women with operable breast cancer were randomized to observation alone, or to adjuvant chemotherapy for 1 year with either cyclophosphamide monotherapy or with a combination of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF). As of January 1987, median follow-up was 68 months. From early on both cyclophosphamide alone and CMF were found to improve recurrence-free survival (RFS) significantly and to a similar degree (P = .0001). However, an overall survival advantage did not become evident until 5 years after the start of treatment. So far, this advantage appears to be more pronounced in CMF (P = .0065) than in cyclophosphamide-only patients (P = .08). Thus, the study confirms the findings of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project (NSABP) and Milan trials that adjuvant chemotherapy prolongs the survival of premenopausal women with early breast cancer. A retrospective analysis revealed that, in contrast with CMF, cyclophosphamide alone did not improve RFS significantly in subsets of patients without amenorrhea, with estrogen-receptor (ER) negative tumors, and with tumors of low histological differentiation. Assuming that cyclophosphamide alone is a less tumoricidal treatment than CMF, these findings suggest that the effect of adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy is mediated partly through chemical castration, and partly through a purely cytotoxic effect</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="591"><COL><DATA> Local-regional versus distant recurrence patterns were investigated for 311 patients with stage II node-positive breast cancer who were part of an endocrine-chemotherapy adjuvant breast cancer trial.

With a median follow-up of 92.1 months, 55.3% of the patients had recurrences. The first site of recurrence was local-regional for 31.4% of patients and distant for 68.6%. This pattern of first recurrence was not associated with treatment groups, menopausal status, race, estrogen receptor value, number of positive lymph nodes, or tumour diameter.

Among patients who had a recurrence, 48.3% had a local-regional recurrence at some time during their follow-up. Conclusions from this study are (1) patterns of recurrence were not affected by the addition of antiestrogen therapy to chemotherapy; (2) for the variables tested, including number of positive nodes and tumor diameter, no association with recurrence patterns was found; and (3) most patients (52.2%) with a first local-regional recurrence will develop a distant recurrence within 1 year</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="608"><COL><DATA> Fifty-nine evaluable patients under 65 years of age with measurable metastatic breast cancer and without prior chemotherapy were randomly assigned to treatment with fluorouracil, Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and cyclophosphamide (FAC) at standard or high doses (100% to 260% higher than standard FAC) following a dose escalation schedule. Patients randomized to the high-dose FAC received the first three cycles of therapy within a protected environment. Subsequent cycles for this group were administered at standard doses of FAC in an ambulatory setting, the same as for the control group. After reaching 450 mg/m2 of Adriamycin, patients in both groups continued treatment with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil until there was disease progression. Analysis of pretreatment patient characteristics showed an even distribution for most known pretreatment factors, although the control group had slightly (but nonsignificantly) more favorable prognostic characteristics.

Patients were randomly assigned to be treated within a protected environment (laminar air flow room), with prophylactic antibiotics, or in a standard hospital room. Important patient characteristics were equally distributed in the two treatment arms. A major objective response was observed in 27 of the 32 evaluable patients (84%), and 11 (34%) achieved a complete remission (CR).

Comparison of the results of this study with previously reported programs of FAC chemotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer shows that this study achieved higher overall and complete response rates. However, neither the time to progression, nor the survival of responders or the entire patient group was different from our previous experience with standard FAC chemotherapy. When the study was initiated in 1976, the proposed dose escalation represented high-dose chemotherapy. In retrospect, even the &quot;high&quot; doses used in this study represent only a modest increase over standard doses of chemotherapy.

Regardless of ER status or menopausal status, the addition of tamoxifen conferred no significant advantage in response rate, response duration, time to treatment failure (TTF) or survival over CAF alone. A secondary objective was to compare the response to CAF of ER positive (ER+) and ER negative (ER-) patients to determine if there was a differential response to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Response rates of ER+ and ER- patients to CAF were identical (56%), but the response duration, time to treatment failure, and survival of ER+ patients were significantly longer than ER- patients.

There was no significant difference in survival according to the treatment, but a weak effect on the course of the disease by either of the treatment protocols cannot be ruled out due to the small sample of patients. Survival and disease-free interval varied significantly according to the histologic status of the regional nodes.

Severe toxicity leading to discontinuation of the medication occurred in 32 patients in the Levamisole arm, versus 10 in the placebo arm. Thirty per cent of patients receiving Levamisole have recurred in comparison with 26% of those on placebo treatment, and despite a trend in the delay of appearance of distant metastasis in the patients receiving Levamisole (30 months versus 9 months in the placebo patients), this drug does not appear to be effective in altering the disease-free survival or the survival of Stage I patients in the dosage schedule utilized in this study</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="858"><COL><DATA> Fifty-nine patients with regional or hematogenous recurrence of malignant melanoma following resection of all the gross tumor were randomized to observation or chemotherapy.

All patients were documented to be without para-aortic lymph node metastasis by pretherapy staging para-aortic lymphadenectomy. The original plan of therapy was for continuous therapy (200 rads/day) of 6,000 rads of pelvic radiation for 6 weeks plus intrauterine radium. However, 16 patients received 6,000 rads in 8 weeks by split-course therapy (2-week rest after 3,000 rads) plus radium. Twenty-nine patients received the planned continuous therapy. The median dose of pelvic radiation for patients who received continuous therapy or split-course radiation was 6,000 rads. Leukopenia (WBC less than 2,500/mm3) was significantly increased in the patients given hydroxyurea as compared to those given placebo (P less than .001). There was no statistically significant difference relative to anemia, thrombocytopenia, radiation skin reaction, diarrhea, or radiation-induced complications requiring surgical correction. The estimated 5-year progression-free survival rate for the combined, continuous, and split-course radiation therapy hydroxyurea patients was 60%, and its was 52% for the corresponding placebo patients (P = .49).

A total of 40 patients with Stage IB and 16 with Stage IIA were randomized to be treated with irradiation alone. A similar group of 48 patients with Stage IB and 14 with IIA were randomized to the preoperative radiation and surgery group. The 5-year, tumor-free actuarial survival for Stage IB patients treated with radiation was 89% and with preoperative radiation and surgery 80%. In Stage IIA, the tumor-free actuarial 5-year survival was 56% for the irradiation alone group and 79% for the patients treated with preoperative radiation and radical hysterectomy. In the patients with Stage IB treated by irradiation alone only one pelvic failure combined with distant metastasis occurred, and 3 patients developed distant metastasis. In the 48 patients treated with combined therapy, there were six pelvic failures (12.5%) all combined with distant metastases and two distant metastases alone. In the 16 patients with Stage IIA treated with radiotherapy alone, there were four pelvic failures (all parametrial), three of them combined with distant metastasis. In the 14 patients treated with irradiation and surgery, two developed a pelvic recurrence, and one distant metastasis. In the preoperative radiation group, the incidence of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes was 6.3% in Stage IB and 7.1% in Stage IIA. Major complications of therapy in the patients treated with radiation alone (10%) consisted of one rectovaginal fistula, two vesicovaginal fistulas, and one rectal stricture. In the preoperative radiation group, three ureteral strictures and two severe proctitis-rectal strictures were noted (8%).

Patients were stratified by tumor size and location and by sex, with no significant differences appearing between the two treatment groups. Median follow-up for both groups was 30 months. The preoperative response rate to chemotherapy was 47%. The postoperative complication rate for patients in the operation-only group was 47%; it was 29% for patients receiving chemotherapy. The overall resectability rates were similar for the two groups. Patients responding to chemotherapy preoperatively had significantly prolonged survival (median greater than 20 months) when compared with either nonresponders (median 6.2 months) or patients receiving only operation (median 8.6 months). A highly significant correlation was noted between a weight loss of less than 10% and response to chemotherapy, which suggested that responses occurred in patients with less advanced disease. We conclude that preoperative and postoperative cisplatin, vindesine, and bleomycin chemotherapy has acceptable toxicity and does not increase the incidence of postoperative complications. The natural history of epidermoid carcinoma of the esophagus is altered and overall survival is prolonged for patients responding to preoperative chemotherapy.

Because of the progression of the disease and complications after operation, there were many inevaluable cases in this study.

Partial responses with a duration ranging from 259 to 406 days were observed in five patients treated with doxifluridine and two patients treated with fluorouracil. Toxic reactions were evaluated in 88 doxifluridine courses and 105 fluorouracil courses. The most frequent adverse effects were neurotoxicity (48% of patients) and mucositis (43%) for doxifluridine, leukopenia (48%) and nausea/emesis (37%) for fluorouracil. Mucositis, diarrhea, nausea, emesis and skin reactions were observed in both treatment groups. Fluorouracil produced neurotoxic effects in 26% of patients. Reversible cardiac dysfunctions were observed in four patients treated with doxifluridine, expressed by ectopic ventricular beats (2) precordial pains (1) and ventricular fibrillation (1). This latter toxicity justified the premature interruption of the study. Doxifluridine is an active agent in colorectal cancer.

All patients received 5-FU, 370 mg/m2/d for five days on the first course, with subsequent dose modifications to maintain equal toxicity in the two arms. One hundred thirty patients were entered on trial and only five were excluded from the analysis because they did not meet the eligibility criteria or they refused therapy after randomization. The two treatment arms were balanced for 11 clinical characteristics. Patients were evaluated for response at the end of every two treatment courses and toxicity after every course of therapy. Median follow-up was 1.45 years. Dose-limiting toxicity was mucositis and diarrhea on this treatment schedule, although neutropenia was apparent. The response rate was 33% (21 of 63 patients) in the 5-FU and FA arm and was 7% (four of 61 patients) in the 5-FU arm (P less than .0005). Time to disease progression was significantly different in the combination arm as compared with the single-agent arm (P = .023). Overall survival was significantly longer for patients treated with 5-FU and FA as compared with those receiving 5-FU alone (P = .05).

From 1977 until 1980, 317 patients were randomized among the same two therapy programs and a control group. With a minimum follow-up in either phase of greater than 7 years, data are now mature. They show no difference in relapse-free survival (RFS) nor overall survival (OS) in either the two-way phase or in the three-way phase. There is no indication, except possibly in one very small subset, that the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy provides an improvement in OS or in RFS. Using data from patients accrued after randomization to the control group, we fail to find evidence that either chemotherapy alone or chemoimmunotherapy improves OS or RFS when contrasted to outcomes obtained by patients on the control arm. In fact, we have significant evidence, at the P = .016 level, that chemotherapy does not improve OS by at least 50%; we also have significant evidence, at the P = .011 level, that chemoimmunotherapy will not improve OS by at least 25%. No evidence of efficacy was demonstrated for either treatment regimen, even though enough therapy was given to result in significant toxicities.

This effect was most obvious in the sigmoid colon with angio-invasive growth. Overall (P = 0.42) and corrected (P = 0.25) survival did not differ significantly among the treatment groups although in every analysis the survival data of the no-touch isolation group were superior.

The Dukes&apos; stages B and C were analyzed in two separate multivariate analyses. In patients with Dukes&apos; B tumours, a poor prognosis was associated with age above 60, perineural and venous invasion, tumour located less than 10 cm from the anal verge and elevated pre-operative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (greater than 3.2 ng ml-1). In patients with Dukes&apos; C tumours, perineural and venous invasion, tumour located less than 10 cm from the anal verge, and elevated pre-operative CEA were associated with a poor prognosis. In addition, a large tumour diameter had a strong, negative influence on the prognosis. Males seemed to have a poorer prognosis than females among the Dukes&apos; C patients. Resection of neighbouring organs was also associated with a poor prognosis in this stage. Post-operative radiotherapy as administered in the present series had no significant influence on prognosis. Based on the derived prognostic models patients with a hazard of death above the median in each stage were selected.

Their average time on study was 64.1 months. The patients were randomized to receive no further treatment (184 patients), postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, semustine, and vincristine (MOF) (187 patients), or postoperative radiation therapy (184 patients). The chemotherapy group, when compared with the group treated by surgery alone, demonstrated an overall improvement in disease-free survival (P = .006) and in survival (P = .05). Employing the proportional hazards model, a global test was used to determine the presence of treatment interactions. Investigation of stratification variables employed in this study indicated that sex, and to a lesser extent age and Dukes stage, made individual contributions to the disease-free survival and the survival benefit from chemotherapy. When evaluated according to sex, the benefit for chemotherapy at 5 years, both in disease-free survival (29% vs. 47%; P less than .001; relative odds, 2.00) and in survival (37% vs. 60%; P = .001; relative odds, 1.93), was restricted to males. When males were tested for age trend with the use of a logistic regression analysis, chemotherapy was found to be more advantageous in younger patients. When the group receiving post-operative radiation (4,600-4,700 rad in 26-27 fractions; 5,100-5,300 rad maximum at the perineum) was compared to the group treated only by surgery, there was an overall reduction in local-regional recurrence from 25% to 16% (P = .06). No significant benefit in overall disease-free survival (P = .4) or survival (P = .7) from the use of radiation has been demonstrated. The global test for interaction to identify heterogeneity of response to radiation within subsets of patients was not significant. In conclusion, this investigation has demonstrated a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (MOF) for the management of rectal cancer. The observed advantage was restricted to males.

Two hundred thirty patients (FAC, 113; FEC, 117) were evaluable for response, and 244 patients for toxicity (FAC, 120; FEC, 124). The two groups were comparable with respect to age, menopausal status, disease-free interval to first recurrence, time from initial diagnosis to protocol activation, indicator lesions, performance status, and prior adjuvant therapy. Of 117 evaluable patients treated with FEC, 59 (50.4%) had a partial response (PR) or complete response (CR), 40 showed no change (NC), and 18 had progressive disease.

The early radiation effects on the normal tissues were similar and acceptable. The late skin changes in the chest wall (treated with 70 kV X rays) were progressive and by 10 years were slightly more marked with 6 fractions. Late subcutaneous fibrosis in the axilla (treated with cobalt-60 teletherapy), however, was much less in the 6-fraction group. Twelve fractions resulted in greater restriction of shoulder movement and an increased incidence of lymphoedema of the arm. Doses were selected on the basis of past clinical experience. The dose used to treat the axilla in 6 fractions was 35 Gy, 14.99% less than that predicted by NSD. The dose predicted by alpha:beta, using a value of 2 Gy for late reactions, is 38.14 Gy. Thus simple theory, which omits time, still predicts too high a dose for 6 fractions, although it is closer than NSD. In this trial, the 6-fraction technique showed an advantage over the 12-fraction technique. It was equally effective in controlling local recurrence and had fewer late sequelae. It was also convenient for patients and economic in the use of radiotherapy resources</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="603"><COL><DATA> 116 patients aged 70 or over who were judged to have surgically resectable cancer of the breast were prospectively randomised to tamoxifen 20 mg daily or surgical resection.

Distant metastases occurred in 8 (13%) in the tamoxifen group and in 10 (18%) in the surgical arm.

Following evaluation of glutamic acid as a potential modifier of vincristine toxicity in preclinical studies in mice and a preliminary clinical trial, a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial was conducted by the Piedmont Oncology Association. Of 87 patients entered into the study, 84 were evaluable, including 42 patients who were randomly assigned to receive vincristine 1.0 mg/m2 weekly for six doses and 42 patients who were assigned to receive glutamic acid 500 mg orally three times daily plus vincristine. The following neurotoxic signs and symptoms were evaluated before each dose of vincristine: reflex changes, paresthesias, constipation, strength, and mental changes. Loss of the Achilles tendon reflex, an objective parameter, was noted in 19 percent of patients receiving glutamic acid and 42 percent of control subjects (p = 0.03). Development of moderate to severe paresthesias, a subjective parameter, occurred in 19 percent of the glutamic acid group and 36 percent of the placebo group (p = 0.09). Overall moderate neurotoxicity (6 units or more), determined by adding the grade of each neurotoxic parameter for the weekly clinic visit in which maximum neurotoxicity occurred, was observed in 21 percent of patients receiving glutamic acid and 43 percent of those in the control group (p = 0.04). Hematologic and gastrointestinal side effects occurred with similar frequency in the two groups. The administration of glutamic acid has decreased vincristine-induced neurotoxicity without any attendant side effects</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="635"><COL><DATA> The present paper concerns two multicenter studies on adjuvant therapy with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MAP) for operable N+ breast cancer. The patients entered the study between April 1979 and March 1986. One hundred and fifty-one premenopausal patients were randomly assigned to receive either polychemotherapy (CMF) or CMF + MAP. One hundred and thirty-eight postmenopausal patients were randomized to receive either MAP h.d. or no treatment. CMF was administered according the following schedule: cyclophosphamide mg 100/ms p.o. 1-4 days; methotrexate mg 40/ms i.v. and fluorouracil mg 600/ms i.v. 1st and 8th days. The cycle was repeated six times every 28 days. MAP was administered at 1000 mg X 2/daily p.o. for 30 days and afterwards 500 mg X 2/daily for 5 months. In the premenopausal study after a median follow-up of 36 months no difference was observed in the incidence of recurrence, site of recurrence, actuarial 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS). In the postmenopausal study a statistically significant lower number of recurrences was observed in MAP-treatment patients after a median follow-up of 37 months. The effect of MAP was limited to patients with less than or equal to 3 metastatic axillary lymph nodes. In addition, there are suggestions that only patients with ER+ tumors draw some advantage from the treatment. On the other hand, no difference exists in the OS. The treatments were substantially well tolerated. The MAP + CMF regimen induces lower vomiting compared to the CMF alone. The most frequent MAP side-effects were vaginal spotting (16%) and tremors (12%). We conclude that MAP h.d., like tamoxifen and aminoglutethimide, can improve the DFS of operable N+ breast cancer in postmenopausal patients</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="643"><COL><DATA> STUDY OBJECTIVE--Comparison of tamoxifen and mastectomy in treatment of breast cancer in elderly patients. DESIGN--Randomised trial of treatment of operable breast cancer by wedge mastectomy or tamoxifen, with median follow up 24 and 25 months respectively (range 1-63). SETTING--University hospital; most patients from primary catchment area. PATIENTS--135 consecutive patients with breast cancer aged over 70 with operable tumours (less than 5 cm maximum diameter); 68 were allocated to tamoxifen group and 67 to mastectomy group. Histological diagnosis by biopsy. Two incorrect randomisations in each group. Patient characteristics similar in the two groups and all under care of one surgical team. INTERVENTIONS--Mastectomy group received wedge mastectomy plus excision of symptomatic axillary lymph nodes. Tamoxifen group received continuous treatment with tamoxifen 20 mg twice daily. Patients in tamoxifen group received wedge mastectomy if there was sign of local progression. Those in mastectomy group received further excision or radiotherapy for locoregional recurrence and when local treatments had been exhausted or metastatic disease diagnosed they received tamoxifen. END POINT--Treatment efficacy was assessed by local control of disease and by survival. MAIN RESULTS--Mortality from metastatic cancer in tamoxifen group was 7 (10.6%) and in mastectomy group 10 (15.3%) (NS). There was no difference in survival between the two groups. In mastectomy group 70% remained alive and free of local recurrence at 24 months; in tamoxifen group only 47% remained alive and free of local progression. In mastectomy group locoregional recurrence occurred in 16 patients and metastatic disease in 13; in tamoxifen group locoregional progression occurred in 29 patients and metastatic disease in seven. CONCLUSIONS--As a high proportion of patients treated with tamoxifen eventually required surgery treatment of elderly patients with breast cancer should include mastectomy. Optimum treatment may include both mastectomy and tamoxifen</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="649"><COL><DATA> The antiemetic effectiveness of haloperidol plus dexamethasone was compared with that of prochlorperazine plus dexamethasone in a prospective study of patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer. Chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or methotrexate, and fluorouracil in all patients. Patients who received the doxorubicin-containing combination experience significantly more nausea and vomiting than those who received the chemotherapy combination containing methotrexate. There was no significant difference between the two antiemetic regimens in the overall incidence of post-chemotherapy nausea and vomiting, but patients who received haloperidol and dexamethasone did have a lower incidence of severe vomiting. Neither regimen is highly effective, especially for the combination containing doxorubicin, and cannot be recommended as standard antiemetic therapy for this population of patients</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="737"><COL><DATA> The purpose of this randomized, prospective study was to determine whether the infusion of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)-enriched solution had a preventive effect for treating postoperative hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis. Among the 56 patients with cirrhosis, 29 were given BCAA-enriched solution, and 27 were given the conventional amino acid solution for 14 days postoperatively. These groups were indistinguishable with regard to clinical and laboratory criteria at entry, except by sex. The molar ratio of BCAA to aromatic amino acids in the BCAA group was increased postoperatively, whereas the ratio in the control group was decreased, the difference being statistically significant. Among the 29 who received BCAA, three (10.3%) had hepatic encephalopathy; two died and one recovered. Of the 27 control patients, hepatic encephalopathy occurred in three (11.1%); one died and two recovered. There was no significant difference in rate of occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy between the groups. Thus the infusion of BCAA-enriched solution apparently had no preventive effect with regard to hepatic encephalopathy for patients with cirrhosis who underwent surgical treatment</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="738"><COL><DATA> To assess the efficacy and safety of Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) in inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 60 patients were randomized to receive Adriamycin 60 to 75 mg/m2 at 3-week intervals and 46 patients to receive no antitumor therapy. The median survival rate of the Adriamycin group was 10.6 weeks; that of the group receiving no antitumor therapy was 7.5 weeks (P = 0.036). Adriamycin induced tumor regression of 25% to 50% in 5% of patients and of over 50% in only 3.3% of patients. It caused fatal complications (septicemia and cardiotoxicity) in 25% of patients. The severity of neutropenia leading to septicemia for a particular dose was unpredictable. Four of eight patients who developed cardiotoxicity received less than 500 mg/m2 of Adriamycin.

Patients with predominantly hepatic metastases or with hepatoma were eligible. They were randomized to receive 2,100 cGy in seven fractions alone or with 5-fluorouracil given either intra-arterially or by iv infusion; doxorubicin and mitomycin were given by bolus simultaneously with the radiation in a single course. A total of 166 patients were entered in the study. Toxicity was acceptable, with no sign of enhanced radiation damage. Response was evaluated 4-6 weeks after treatment. No complete responses were seen, but partial responses greater than or equal to 50% were observed in the groups treated with radiation only (17%), radiation plus drug given iv (25%), and radiation plus drug given intra-arterially (20%) (P greater than .3). Disease progression occurred in a larger number of patients who received radiation only (29%) at 6 weeks than in the other 2 groups (7% and 18%, respectively; P less than .03). Thus, in terms of local response duration, the addition of chemotherapy enhanced the effect of the radiation.

Complete response was achieved in only 1 patient who received multiple hepatic arterial embolizations. Partial responses were observed in 13 patients (61.9%) in group 1, 10 patients (47.6%) in group 2, and 2 patients (9.5%) in group 3.

Patients treated with endoprosthesis had a significantly shorter initial hospital stay than those treated surgically. In the long term, overall survival in the two groups was similar and jaundice was relieved in over 90 per cent of patients. Despite more re-admissions to hospital for those patients treated endoscopically, the total time spent in hospital still remained significantly shorter in this treatment group compared with those subjected to surgery.

Overall response rates of 15 and 43% were seen with CAF and CAF plus hormonal therapy. Using a multivariate analysis of the results, this difference is significant (P value 0.05).

For AMSA + DTIC the starting dose was: AMSA 30 mg/m2/day X 3 days; DTIC, 800 mg/m2 X 1 day. Additionally, seven pts received AMSA in a similar dose schedule but DTIC was used in a 5-day schedule of 250 mg/m2/day. Twenty-five patients were evaluable for response in the AMSA group and 36 in the AMSA + DTIC group. The objective response to AMSA included 1(4%) partial response compared with 11 complete or partial responses (30%) with AMSA + DTIC therapy. The median lowest absolute granulocyte count was 1100/microliters in AMSA group compared with 1000/microliters in the AMSA + DTIC group. Severe neutropenia of less than 500 granulocytes/microliter was observed in 5 pts in the AMSA group compared with 13 pts in the AMSA + DTIC group.

Therapy was initiated within 90 days of resection of all evident tumor and continued until 2 years of disease-free survival or the occurrence of unresectable dissemination of melanoma. Known prognostic variables were similarly distributed in the treatment and control groups, documenting the randomization efficacy. Three endpoints were analyzed: disease-free interval, time to Stage III metastasis, and survival. After a median follow-up period of 24.75 months, there was a trend in favor of the placebo group with regard to all three endpoints and this was significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) for time to Stage III metastasis.

We conducted a randomized prospective study to assess the efficacy of narrow excision (excision with 1-cm margins) for primary melanomas no thicker than 2 mm. Narrow excision was performed in 305 patients, and wide excision (margins of 3 cm or more) was performed in 307 patients. The major prognostic criteria were well balanced in the two groups. The mean thickness of melanomas was 0.99 mm in the narrow-excision group and 1.02 mm in the wide-excision group. The subsequent development of metastatic disease involving regional nodes and distant organs was not different in the two groups (4.6 and 2.3 percent, respectively, in the narrow-excision group, as compared with 6.5 and 2.6 percent in the wide-excision group). Disease-free survival rates and overall survival rates (mean follow-up period, 55 months) were also similar in the two groups. Only three patients had a local recurrence as a first relapse. All had undergone narrow excision, and each had a primary melanoma with a thickness of 1 mm or more. The absence of local recurrence in the group of patients with a primary melanoma thinner than 1 mm and the very low rate of local recurrences indicate that narrow excision is a safe and effective procedure for such patients</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="936"><COL><DATA> To evaluate the effectiveness of regional hyperthermic cytostatic perfusion in patients with malignant melanomas of the extremities, 107 patients were included in a prospective randomized study.

The patients in the perfusion group (B, n = 53) received additional hyperthermic (42 degrees C) perfusion with melphalan. The disease-free survival time was chosen as the criterion for success. An intermediate evaluation (average follow-up observation period of 550 days) revealed a highly significant difference between the groups (P = 0.0001): 21 recurrences in the control group versus four recurrences in the perfusion group. In a second analysis 3 1/2 years after premature discontinuation, 26 recurrences were diagnosed in Group A, whereas only six recurrences were noted in Group B (P = 0.0001). A retrospective analysis of the entire test group revealed the following figures. In Group A seven recurrences in Stage I were diagnosed, seven in Stage II, and 12 in Stage III. In Group B one was observed in Stage I, one in Stage II, and four in Stage III. The level of significance was calculated to be P = 0.05 in Stage I, P = 0.05 in Stage II, and P = 0.01 in Stage III.

Thirteen per cent of patients in arm 2 and thirteen per cent in arm 3 suffered major toxicity, necessitating interruption of treatment. Two of these patients died of marrow aplasia. Statistical analysis of survival showed that prognosis was influenced by the well-known prognostic variables, invasion of the wall, nodal status and site of tumour. The different treatments in the three arms, however, did not show any impact on prognosis, even when adjustments were made for the most relevant prognostic variables.

There were no postoperative deaths. Four patients have died from the disease in the R1 group and five in the R2 group, there being no difference in the probability of survival at a median follow-up of 3.1 years.

There was no statistically significant difference between the two treatment arms in terms of local control, overall distant metastases and survival with no evidence of disease (NED), although the incidence of para-aortic metastases and distant metastases without tumor at pelvic sites was significantly higher in patients receiving pelvic irradiation alone (pelvic group). The 4-year NED survival rate was 51%. The incidence of severe digestive complications was significantly higher in patients receiving para-aortic irradiation (para-aortic group).

Coverage was reasonably complete for most countries. In 28 trials of tamoxifen nearly 4000 of 16,513 women had died, and in 40 chemotherapy trials slightly more than 4000 of 13,442 women had died. The 8106 deaths were approximately evenly distributed over years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5+ of follow-up, with little useful information beyond year 5. Systematic overviews of the results of these trials demonstrated reductions in mortality due to treatment that were significant when tamoxifen was compared with no tamoxifen (P less than 0.0001), any chemotherapy with no chemotherapy (P = 0.003), and polychemotherapy with single-agent chemotherapy (P = 0.001). In tamoxifen trials, there was a clear reduction in mortality only among women 50 or older, for whom assignment to tamoxifen reduced the annual odds of death during the first five years by about one fifth. In chemotherapy trials there was a clear reduction only among women under 50, for whom assignment to polychemotherapy reduced the annual odds of death during the first five years by about one quarter. Direct comparisons showed that combination chemotherapy was significantly more effective than single-agent therapy, but suggested that administration of chemotherapy for 8 to 24 months may offer no survival advantage over administration of the same chemotherapy for 4 to 6 months. Because it involved several thousand women, this overview was able to demonstrate particularly clearly that both tamoxifen and cytotoxic therapy can reduce five-year mortality</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1199"><COL><DATA> The present study comprises 847 women operated upon for invasive breast carcinoma at 19 surgical departments and enrolled in protocol DBCG-82TM from January 1983 to November 1987.

Within the randomized group 6% could not be entered into adjuvant protocols, i.e. subsequent programmes of postoperative therapy and follow-up. This left 619 evaluable patients.

No survival advantage was observed during four years of follow-up (92 percent for placebo vs. 93 percent for tamoxifen; P = 0.3). There was a significant prolongation of disease-free survival among women treated with tamoxifen, as compared with those receiving placebo (83 percent vs. 77 percent; P less than 0.00001). This advantage was observed in both the patients less than or equal to 49 years old (P = 0.0005) and those greater than or equal to 50 (P = 0.0008), particularly in the former, among whom the rate of treatment failure was reduced by 44 percent. Multivariate analysis indicated that all subgroups of patients benefited. Tamoxifen significantly reduced the rate of treatment failure at local and distant sites, tumors in the opposite breast, and the incidence of tumor recurrence after lumpectomy and breast irradiation. The benefit was attained with a low incidence of clinically appreciable toxic effects. The magnitude of the improvement obtained does not preclude the need for future trials in which patients given tamoxifen could serve as the control group in an evaluation of potentially better therapies. Tamoxifen treatment is justified in patients who meet the eligibility criteria of the present study and who refuse to participate in those trials.

No survival advantage was observed with this therapy as compared with no postoperative therapy during four years of follow-up (87 percent vs. 86 percent; P = 0.8). However, there was a significant prolongation of disease-free survival among women who received this therapy as compared with those who did not (80 percent vs. 71 percent; P = 0.003). An advantage was observed in both the patients less than or equal to 49 years old and those greater than or equal to 50. At four years, treatment failure was reduced by 24 percent in the younger group and by 50 percent in the older group. The rates of both local and regional and distant metastases were decreased. These benefits, achieved without the use of an alkylating agent, were associated with tolerable side effects. Multivariate analysis testing for potential interactions failed to identify subgroups of patients who did not benefit from the therapy. These results, although promising, do not obviate the need for additional trials to evaluate potentially better regimens of therapy, but they do suggest that sequential methotrexate-fluorouracil should be used in the control arm in such studies. Their use is also justified for the treatment of patients who refuse to participate in clinical trials, provided the patients meet the eligibility criteria of the present study. Since women with tumors too small for conventional analysis of estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor concentrations were not included in this study, we do not recommend systemic treatment for them outside of a clinical trial</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="200"><COL><DATA> This presentation is a randomized prospective study of 74 patients of squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus divided into two groups.

Both treatments gave good relief of dysphagia compared with pretreatment values on a dysphagia score, the results being statistically significant (p less than 0.005). However, there was no difference in the improvement achieved by one method compared with the other. The tumor probe was not difficult to use and complication rates were comparable. In the Atkinson tube group, two patients developed complications related to the position of the prosthesis and in three others food blocked the tube. Treatment with the tumor probe needed repeating at intervals (median, 28 days; range, 2 to 86 days) in all but four individuals to maintain palliation, with each patient needing a median of two treatments (range, 1 to 8). The probe may have advantages in very high esophageal lesions and may facilitate the treatment of tumor overgrowth or undergrowth of a tube.

One hundred and twenty-three patients were randomized to have either a cervical or thoracic anastomosis. Thirty-one patients were subsequently excluded either because esophagectomy was performed without thoracotomy or the tumor was unresectable or because the randomization protocol was not complied with. Transfusion requirements and operating time were similar for the 49 patients having esophagectomy by way of the laparotomy and right thoracotomy (TA) and the 43 patients who underwent laparotomy, right thoracotomy and cervicotomy (CA). Forty-three per cent of the CA and 49 per cent of the TA patients had involved lymph nodes. An esophagectomy incorporating a cervical anastomosis resulted in a significantly greater margin of macroscopically normal esophagus above the tumor (median of 4.0 versus 1.5 centimeters for TA). A leak was significantly more frequent after cervical anastomosis (26 per cent) than thoracic (4 per cent) (p less than 0.002). Respiratory complications were more frequent with a thoracic anastomosis, but this was not statistically significant. Thirty day mortality rates were similar for the two groups: 14.3 per cent, TA, and 9.3 per cent, CA (p = N.S.). Postoperative strictures occurred in 14 per cent of TA and 23 per cent of CA patients and were most common after an anastomotic leak. The survival patterns of the two groups were similar. The median survival time for CA patients was 23 months and for TA, 20 months. Excluding hospital mortality, 47 per cent of patients were alive at two years and 30 per cent at 40 months. Survival was related to extent of disease. The greater length of tumor-free esophagus removed with a cervical anastomosis did not result in an improved long term survival period, but was associated with a significantly higher incidence of anastomotic fistula</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="234"><COL><DATA> One hundred seventy-nine patients with advanced measurable colorectal cancer not previously treated with chemotherapy were entered into a prospective randomized clinical trial by the Mid-Atlantic Oncology Program (MAOP) to compare two schedules of delivery for single-agent fluorouracil (5-FU). The &quot;standard&quot; treatment was a schedule commonly employed in clinical practice, namely, a daily bolus dose administered intravenously (IV) for five consecutive days and repeated at 5-week intervals. The investigational treatment was a continuous infusion of 5-FU administered 24 hours a day for a protracted time (10 weeks or more). Both treatments were continued until the development of disease progression or unless interrupted for toxicity. Using stringent objective criteria requiring independent confirmation of x-ray or scan-documented response, the tumor response rate reached 7% (six of 87) for the bolus arm and 30% (26 of 87) for the infusion arms (P less than .001). Toxicity was substantially different for the two arms with major leukopenia observed only on the bolus arm, 22% developing grade 3 (severe) or grade 4 (life-threatening) leukopenia with four sepsis-related deaths. Hand-foot syndrome was observed only in the infusional arm, requiring treatment interruptions and dose reductions in 24% of patients, but with little impact on quality of life. In spite of the major difference in objective response rate, overall survival for the two groups was comparable. Administration of 5-FU as a continuous infusion for protracted periods clearly improves the therapeutic index for this agent in patients with advanced colon cancer with respect to response rate and reduced toxicity. This schedule appears workable in the community setting and yields response rates similar to those reported for 5-FU with high-dose leucovorin, but without the gastroin testinal toxicity profile of the latter combination</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="307"><COL><DATA> Seventy-seven patients with previously untreated, measurable, histologically confirmed, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the rectum or sigmoid were randomized to receive either epirubicin 90 mg/m2 (75 mg/m2 if prior radiotherapy) i.v. once every 3 weeks or 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 (450 mg/m2 if prior radiotherapy) i.v. once daily for 5 consecutive days every 4 weeks. None of 38 (0%) evaluable patients who received epirubicin demonstrated a response, whereas seven of 39 (18%) patients who received 5-fluorouracil had an objective response.

The primary aim of the trial was to investigate the 5-year survival rate in both groups; a secondary aim was to analyze the local recurrence rate and finally the anatomopathologic tumoral classification after surgery. All patients were followed at least 8 years. The preoperative irradiation group (Group A) was submitted to 4000 cGy for 4 weeks and surgery was performed 1 week after irradiation. All tumors were classified anatomically and pathologically according to Broders&apos; and Dukes&apos; classifications. The results indicated that there is a significant difference in the five-year survival rates in both groups: group A had a corrected survival rate of 80 percent; group B (nonirradiated) had a corrected survival rate of 80 percent; group B (nonirradiated) had a corrected survival rate of 34.4 percent. The local recurrence rate was 2.9 percent in group A and 23.5 percent in group B. Regarding tumor regression, before radiotherapy 64.6 percent of the tumors were Broders&apos; Grades 3 and 4; after radiotherapy these were reduced to 20.5 percent.

The log-rank analysis of results shows no disease-free or overall survival advantage for patients receiving adjuvant therapy compared with the control group. Patients receiving adjuvant immunotherapy for stage B2 appear to have a significantly inferior disease-free survival compared with other groups, but their overall survival is similar. There are no significant differences in disease-free or overall survival in the three groups of patients with stage C tumour.

A maximally tolerated intravenous bolus loading course regimen of 5-FU alone (500 mg/m2 x 5 days every 4 weeks with 25 mg/m2 escalation) was compared with a high-dose leucovorin regimen (600 mg/m2 of 5-FU with 500 mg/m2 of leucovorin weekly for 6 weeks with a 2-week rest) and with a similar low-dose leucovorin regimen (600 mg/m2 of 5-FU with 25 mg/m2 of leucovorin weekly for 6 weeks with a 2-week rest). The dose-limiting toxicity for the two 5-FU and leucovorin regimens was gastrointestinal, specifically diarrhea; severe diarrhea was seen frequently, and treatment-related toxicity was implicated in the demise of 11 of the patients (5%). Significant improvements in response rates were observed with a response rate of 33 of 109 (30.3%) on the high-dose leucovorin regimen (P less than .01 v control); 13 of 107 (12.1%) on the 5-FU control; and 21 of 112 (18.8%) on the low-dose leucovorin regimen.

Commentary is made about the diverging results from earlier studies on antimicrobial prophylaxis and on the multifactorial causality of surgical infection. We believe that variables such as physical condition of the patients, virulence and local resistance patterns of bacteria, and technical skill of the surgeons are far more important in regard to the postoperative outcome concerning septic complications than is the choice of proper antibiotics. Thus, to determine the efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis, we call for larger investigations in the future, preferably double-blind, where it is possible to better control and diminish the influence of determinants other than the antibiotics being compared</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="449"><COL><DATA> Seventy-four patients with Dukes&apos; B2 through C3 colon or rectal cancer were entered into a prospectively randomized, controlled trial of active specific immunotherapy (ASI) with an autologous tumor cell-BCG vaccine.

Patients were randomized into groups treated by resection alone (control) or resection plus ASI. All patients with rectal cancer received 5,040 rads of pelvic irradiation post-operatively. With a median follow-up of 56 mo, there is a moderately significant difference in the distribution of time-to-recurrence (P = .037) and a comparably significant difference in the distributions of time-to-death (P = .031); both comparisons favor the ASI group. Most of the difference was due to the subgroup with colon cancer. With such small numbers of patients, we cannot conclude that ASI is of proven therapeutic benefit.

DNA aneuploidy was detected in 60 patients (62 per cent) in the surgery only group, but in only 33 patients (37 per cent) after radiotherapy (P less than 0.01). There was a significant reduction in local recurrence in irradiated patients (P less than 0.0001). DNA diploid tumours were less likely to recur locally.

They were randomized either for IA or for IA + systemic 5-FU 700 mg/m2/d x 3 days/month (IA/IV). Forty-six (46) patients were evaluable (26 IA; 20 IA/IV). Both groups were comparable in respect to primary tumor stage, age, liver function tests, tumor markers and extent of tumor infiltration. Twenty-six (26) patients (56%) demonstrated a complete (CR) or partial response (PR) with at least a 50% decrease in CEA levels and a significant tumor volume reduction (IA 50%; IA/IV 65%). Quality of response was significantly correlated with median survival (MS) time of 25 months for CR and PR. Approximate MS for IA and IA/IV was 16 and 19.5 months, respectively, and approximate median survival time to extra- and/or intrahepatic progression was 9 months (IA) and 11 months (IA/IV). Incidence of extrahepatic recurrence was not influenced by any treatment (IA 62%; IA/IV 60%). Overall approximate median time to occurrence of extrahepatic disease was 12.5 months (IA 13; IA/IV 10). Liver disease progression was observed in 38 patients (IA 85%; IA/IV 80%). A median time of 8 months to diagnosis of liver disease progression was calculated for IA, and IA/IV was 11.5 months. Incidence of chemical hepatitis for IA and IA/IV was 54 and 45%, while biliary sclerosis occurred in 15% and 10% of the cases, respectively, and did not correlate with response rates. Systemic side effects (25%) were only observed in the IA/IV group and induced significantly more interruptions of therapy than in the IA group.

The study objectives were to compare the hepatic response rate, time to hepatic progression, and toxicity for the two treatment arms. The study design, which allowed patients failing IV FUDR to crossover to the IA arm, prevents a meaningful comparative analysis of survival. Patients with liver-only metastases (N = 143) were randomized, 76 to the IV arm and 67 to the IA arm, and 115 patients (65 IV, 50 IA) were fully evaluable. Of the 65 patients in the IV arm, 28 crossed over to IA treatment after failing IV FUDR. The dose-limiting toxicity of IV FUDR was diarrhea, whereas biliary toxicity limited both the dose and duration of IA FUDR therapy. Of the first 25 patients treated with IA FUDR at a dose of .3 mg/kg/day, 10 developed radiographically evident biliary strictures, and three developed permanent jaundice. With reduction of the initial IA FUDR dose to .2 mg/kg/day, and adoption of a policy of early dosage reduction, treatment interruption, or termination of therapy for persistent elevations in alkaline phosphatase, only two further cases of serious biliary toxicity occurred. However, 26 of the 50 IA FUDR patients ultimately had therapy terminated because of drug toxicity rather than disease progression. When compared with systemic infusion, infusion into the hepatic artery greatly enhanced the antitumor activity of FUDR against colorectal liver metastases. Although biliary toxicity is the most serious limitation of this form of therapy, biliary stricture and jaundice usually can be averted through careful monitoring of liver enzymes and early dosage reduction</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="528"><COL><DATA> The effect of hepatic irradiation (RT) after intraarterial 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was evaluated in 37 randomized patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma hepatic metastases.

Hepatic irradiation of 25.5 Gy was delivered to 19 patients 14 days after completion of infusion (CT + RT). All patients received subsequent weekly maintenance 5-FU. A 37% (seven of 19) response rate was observed in CT + RT, and a 50% response rate (nine of 18) in CT: median survival was 6 months for CT + RT, and 8 months for CT, (P = 0.106). Improved survival was observed in two subsets of patients. Tumor vascularity was graded angiographically from 0 to 4+; those patients with highest vascularity (4+) had a 20-month median survival (P = 0.0009).

A continuous 14-day infusion regimen of FUDR was applied each month. The dosage was 0.2 mg/kg/d of FUDR for the IA group and 0.3 mg/kg/d for the IA/IV group. The complete and partial response rates were each 50% in the pilot study and 52% and 48% in the IA and IA/IV randomized groups, respectively. Drug toxicities in the 64 patients included gastroenteritis (21%), chemical hepatitis (57%), and biliary sclerosis (25%).

DESIGN--Prospective randomised clinical trial. Two thousand subjects needed for study to have a 90% chance of detecting a difference in survival rate of 7% with 95% significance. Patients were followed up until June 1988, giving follow up of 158-216 months. SETTING--A multicentre trial mainly drawing patients from centres in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS--2800 Women presenting with clinical stage I or II carcinoma of the breast from June 1970 to April 1975. INTERVENTIONS--One group of women (n = 1376) had simple mastectomy followed by immediate postoperative radiotherapy (1320 to 1510 rets). The remaining women (n = 1424) had simple mastectomy with subsequent careful observation of the axilla, radiotherapy being delayed until there was obvious progression or recurrence of disease locally. END POINT--Increased mortality in patients treated with radiotherapy from causes other than breast cancer. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Survival was measured from time of first treatment to death or last follow up. Deaths from any cause and from specified causes were counted as events. Comparison over the whole follow up showed a slight excess mortality in the group treated with radiotherapy (relative risk 1.04; 95% confidence interval 0.94 to 1.15). The relative risk of death from breast cancer was 0.97 (0.87 to 1.08) but that of death from other causes was 1.37 (1.09 to 1.72), the increase mainly being in women who had had tumours of the left breast (1.61 (1.17 to 2.24)) and had been treated with orthovoltage (1.85 (1.27 to 2.71)). Analysis of causes of death after five years showed a relative risk of 2.11 (1.25 to 3.59) for new malignancies and of 1.65 (1.05 to 2.58) for cardiac disease, the increase in cardiac mortality being most pronounced in patients who had had tumours of the left breast and whose treatment had included orthovoltage radiation (relative risk 2.67 (1.28 to 5.55)). CONCLUSIONS--Adjuvant radiotherapy after simple mastectomy for early breast cancer produces a small excess late mortality from other cancers and cardiac disease. The risk has to be balanced against the higher risk of local recurrence when immediate postoperative radiotherapy is not given. The balance has to be assessed for each patient, and for many patients radiotherapy will still be desirable in the initial treatment of their early breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="610"><COL><DATA> Seventy-seven patients with progressive metastatic breast cancer refractory to prior therapy participated in a prospective randomized trial designed to compare the efficacy and toxicity of doxorubicin and epirubicin administered as single agents. In arm 1, 60 mg/m2 of doxorubicin and, in arm 2, 90 mg/m2 of epirubicin were administered by 48-h continuous i.v. infusion every 3 weeks. In arm 3, 90 mg/m2 of epirubicin was administered by bolus every 3 weeks. Patients in the three groups had similar characteristics, except that in arm 3 more patients were premenopausal, had more extensive disease, and fewer patients had been exposed to doxorubicin. Objective remission rates were 29, 26, and 13%, respectively for the three arms. Median response durations ranged from 4-6 months. No significant differences occurred in response rate, remission duration, or survival among patients in the three arms. The incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity and alopecia was evenly distributed. Hematologic toxicity was more severe in arms 2 and 3, and there was a higher incidence of infectious complications in arms 2 and 3 compared to arm 1 (p = 0.05). Two episodes of congestive heart failure occurred in arm 1, one in arm 2, and three in arm 3. Although the total cumulative anthracycline dosage was highest in the arm 2 group, they had the lowest incidence of cardiac toxicity. Epirubicin by bolus and doxorubicin administered by continuous infusion have similar potential for cardiac toxicity. Epirubicin administered by continuous infusion appears less cardiotoxic than doxorubicin by either method of administration or epirubicin given by bolus.

The aim of the study was to find the optimal first line treatment and possibly evaluate the role of cis platinum in breast cancer chemotherapy. The CAP schedule consisted of cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 i.v. days 1, 3 and 5, adriamycin 40 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, and platinum 30 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, 3 and 5. The FAC schedule included 5-FU 500 mg/m2 days 1 and 8, adriamycin 50 mg/m2 day 1, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 day 1. One hundred and twenty-six previously untreated patients received greater than 2 cycles and were evaluated. In the CAP arm 15 complete (26%) and 24 partial remissions were observed, resulting in a 67% overall response rate (39/58). The response in soft tissue and visceral organs was notable (78% - 22/28, 71% - 15/21) with an important complete response rate (32%). In the FAC arm there was an overall response in 41% (28/68) of patients, with 8 complete (12%) and 20 partial responses. The difference in overall response, complete response, and response in soft tissue and visceral organs, was statistically significant in favor of the CAP arm (P less than 0.005). Concerning bone metastases there was no difference between the two schedules in response rate, nor in the median remission duration (CAP 11, FAC 10 months). In spite of a somewhat longer median survival in the CAP group, the difference (13 months vs 9 months) was not statistically significant (P = 0.10). Toxicity was moderate and tolerable in both regimens with more pronounced myelosuppression and vomiting in the CAP group.

They were randomized to receive either idarubicin (IDA) 45 mg/m2 orally or doxorubicin (DX) 75 mg/m2 intravenously (IV), both drugs being administered every 3 weeks. Among 37 evaluable patients who received DX treatment the overall response rate was 46%, whereas it was 21% in 34 evaluable patients treated with IDA. This difference was statistically significant. In previously untreated patients the response rate with DX was 60% compared to 29% with IDA. Patients with prior chemotherapy had 29% response rate to DX in contrast to 12% with IDA. The median time to response, the median response duration, and the median time to progression were similar in both groups. The median survival of all patients was 20 months in DX arm and 14 months in IDA arm (95% confidence limits 16.69-23.31 and 10.77-17.23, respectively; P = 0.09). Both treatments produced equivalent incidence and severity of myelotoxicity. Gastrointestinal toxicity and alopecia were significantly lower in patients receiving IDA. As for cardiotoxicity, four cases of congestive heart failure were recorded among patients treated with DX whereas no cases occurred in the IDA group.

Patients were stratified according to ER status and dominant site of disease and randomized to one of three regimens: cyclophosphamide, 5-Fluorouracil, and prednisone (CFP) versus CFP, methotrexate, and vincristine (CFPMV) versus doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC). There was no significant differences in all response categories (P = 0.21), was taken as a predictor for response to chemotherapy, there was no significant difference in overall response (P = 0.61) between ER+ (62/108, 57%) and ER- patients (31/49, 63%). However, there was a significant trend toward a higher degree of response in ER- patients (more complete response [CR] nine of 49, 18%, and fewer failures six of 49, 12%) than in ER+ (less CR seven of 108, 7%, and more failures 37/108, 34%) (P = 0.006). Patients with higher measured levels of ER showed worse response (Kendall&apos;s tau C, P = 0.026). This trend for ER- patients to have better response than ER+ patients was generally consistent, regardless of the predominant site of metastases or chemotherapy regimen (P = 0.04 for CFP; P = 0.08 for CFPMV; and P = 0.20 for AC). The advantage of a better response for ER- patients was nullified by an earlier relapse which was reflected in longer duration of remission, time to treatment failure, and survival in favor of ER+ patients (12.3 months versus 7.3 months remission duration, 18.7 months versus 13.6 months survival in partial responders). These data suggest that ER- patients respond to a higher extent to chemotherapy but relapse sooner than ER+ patients, suggesting a more rapid growth for ER- tumors. In patients with ER- tumors and poorer prognosis on conventional chemotherapy, new trials of intensive consolidation after response should be considered</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="647"><COL><DATA> The German Breast Cancer Study Group has a large, homogeneous patient population with pT1 pN0 breast cancers who have undergone a detailed pathohistological work-up and uniform treatment.

Moreover, in order to improve the quality of radiation therapy, all dosimetric data, radiation protocols, and localization, and verification films are reviewed by the Radiotherapeutic Study Centre. By January 31, 1988, 762 patients had been recruited. At the moment, after an admittedly short follow-up period for the majority of our patients, there is no evidence of differences between the two treatment arms concerning the incidence of local and distant recurrences, contralateral breast cancers, and other malignancies.

Patients were switched to the other drug if: (a) there was progressive disease after 12 weeks, (b) unacceptable toxicity developed and (c) they had received a total of 500 mg m-2 of doxorubicin. Six patients had switching over of therapy, three on doxorubicin and three on rIFN. In the remaining 69 patients on single drug therapy, the median survival rate of patients on doxorubicin and rIFN was 4.8 and 8.3 weeks respectively (P = ns.). rIFN induced tumour regression of 25-50% in 12% of patients and of over 50% in 10% of patients. When compared with doxorubicin, rIFN was associated with more tumour regression (P = 0.00199) and less progressive tumours (P = 0.00017). It caused less prolonged and less severe marrow suppression (P = 0.01217), and had significantly less fatal complications than doxorubicin (P = 0.01383). Doxorubicin caused fatal complications due to cardiotoxicity and neutropenia in 25% of patients. rIFN was associated with fatal complications due to dementia and renal failure in 3.8% of patients.

The Cooperative Study Group conducted a controlled study on MQ-F-OK therapy and the combination of mitomycin C, 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin, including the intra-arterial administration of mitomycin C and doxorubicin (FAM therapy), against advanced liver cancer. Forty patients with advanced primary or secondary liver cancer were enrolled in this study and randomized into the MQ-F-OK group and the FAM group. Seventeen of the 21 cases in the MQ-F-OK group and 16 of the 19 cases in the FAM group were eligible for response evaluation in accordance with the criteria of the Japan Society for Cancer Therapy. There was no significant difference in the patient characteristics between the two groups. Three cases in the MQ-F-OK group and two in the FAM group showed partial response. There was, however, no significant difference in the response rates and the prolongation of life between the two groups. As for the side-effects, only anemia was observed more frequently in the FAM group than in the MQ-F-OK group. In conclusion, we could not preferentially recommend either MQ-F-OK therapy or FAM therapy for advanced liver cancer.

The duration of follow-up ranged from 42 to 132 months (median follow-up, 72 months). Crude survival and relapse rates were similar for both groups. Death due to intercurrent disease was higher in the progesterone group (P = 0.04). The median survival of the group of patients with cancer-related death was higher in the progestagen group than in the control group (30 and 22 months, respectively; P = 0.03). In 461 high-risk patients, a tendency towards fewer cancer-related deaths and a better disease-free survival in the treatment group was observed, but crude survival was unchanged.

The distribution of known prognostic factors (sex, age, number of positive nodes, extracapsular invasion) was balanced in the groups of patients either with initially negative or with positive skin reactivity. All patients who were initially non-reactive to BCG developed skin reactivity after 6.7 +/- 9 BCG vaccinations. Disease-free and overall survival of patients receiving BCG or BCG + DTIC with an initially negative skin reactivity to BCG was significantly (P = 7 x 10(-3) better than that observed in patients with an initial positive skin reactivity.

Disease-free survival was also greater for patients who received this hormonal therapy (3.4 versus 1.1 years, median disease-free survival), but the difference was not statistically significant (two-sided log rank p = 0.20). The most noteworthy side effects were weight gain (median 6-month gain of 8.2 kg) and impotence.

The routine use of agents potentially capable of reducing these side-effects has not been recommended out of concern for possible reductions in the therapeutic activity of interferon. We conducted a prospective randomized trial of alpha-interferon given with or without indomethacin to patients with malignant melanoma to determine what effect, if any, indomethacin might have on the toxic, immunomodulatory, and therapeutic properties of interferon in this disease. 53 patients were stratified according to performance status and randomized to receive alpha 2b-interferon, 20 million units per m2 i.v., 5 days per week for 4 weeks followed by 10 million units per m2 s.c. three times per week, either with or without indomethacin, 25 mg orally three times a day. The overall major response rate was 13% (three complete responders and three partial responders among 47 evaluable patients) and was the same on both arms. The mean maximal temperature elevation induced by interferon was significantly reduced (from 102.1 to 100.7, P = 0.0002) by indomethacin, but the incidence and severity of interferon-related fatigue, reduction in performance status, headache, depression, confusion, elevations in liver function tests, and myelosuppression were no different in either arm of the study. Indomethacin did not reduce the frequency of dose reductions for toxic side-effects and did not permit the administration of higher interferon doses. Peripheral blood natural killer activity was significantly enhanced in patients during maintenance therapy whether or not they received indomethacin. Indomethacin appeared to inhibit augmentation of natural killer activity during high dose induction therapy. Immunological changes did not correlate with response status. We conclude that indomethacin can reduce the fever associated with interferon therapy in patients with malignant melanoma without interfering with its therapeutic or chronic immunomodulatory activities. Since fever is rarely the dose-limiting toxicity of interferon, indomethacin is of marginal benefit to patients with malignant melanoma receiving interferon at the doses outlined in this study</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="934"><COL><DATA> A prospective randomized study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of additional regional cytostatic perfusion of the extremities in patients with malignant melanoma. In a control group (n = 54), the tumors were widely excised, and regional lymph nodes were dissected. The patients in the perfusion group (n = 53) received additional hyperthermic (42 degrees C) perfusion with Melphalan. The disease-free survival time was chosen as the criterion for evaluation. An intermediate analysis revealed a highly significant difference between the 2 groups (21 recurrences in the control group and 4 recurrences in the perfusion group, p less than 0.001). Therefore, the study was discontinued prematurely. In an analysis of the data performed after a median observation time of 5 years and 11 months, 26 recurrences were diagnosed in the control group, whereas 6 recurrences were noted in the perfusion group (p less than 0.001).

After 6 months of treatment, an objective tumor response was noted in five of the patients treated with IFN (50%) but in none of the patients on chemotherapy. Stable disease was found in five patients (50%) on IFN treatment and four (40%) on chemotherapy. Progressive disease was noted in six of the patients (60%) receiving chemotherapy. A statistical analysis using the chi-square test showed a significantly higher proportion of responders and stable disease in the IFN treated group (P = 0.0039). Furthermore, three of eight patients who had previously received chemotherapy showed later on an objective response to IFN. The objective responses were mainly noted in decreased tumor markers; however, two patients also showed a significant reduction of tumor size. Subjective responses were noted in 72% of patients treated with interferon, but only in 9% of those treated with streptozocin plus 5-fluorouracil.

Two hundred seventy-four patients received NG decompression (Salem sump, Argyle Co., Division of Sherwood Medical, St. Louis, MO) and two hundred sixty-one did not. There were 33 protocol violations included in the 535 patients. Patients who were not decompressed experienced significantly more abdominal distention, nausea, and vomiting than did those patients who were. Moreover, 13% required subsequent NG decompression as opposed to a reinsertion rate of 5% for patients routinely decompressed. The mean length of hospitalization for both groups was 11 days. There were no significant differences in nasopharyngeal or gastric bleeding, inability to cough effectively, respiratory infections, wound disruptions, reoperation, and wound infection rates (5%) between the two groups.

Five hundred ninety-six patients had metastatic cancer that either had failed standard effective therapies or had disease for which no standard effective therapy existed, and 56 patients were treated in the absence of evaluable disease in the adjuvant setting. IL-2 was administered either alone (155 patients) or in conjunction with activated immune cells such as lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells (214 patients) or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) (66 patients), with other cytokines such as alpha interferon (a- IFN)(128 patients) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)(38 patients), with monoclonal antibodies (32 patients), or with the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide (19 patients). Initial results with the treatment of high-dose IL-2 alone or in conjunction with LAK cells have indicated that objective regressions of cancer can be achieved in 20% to 35% of patients with selected advanced metastatic cancers. Although most responses have been seen in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer, melanoma, colorectal cancer, and non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma, many histologic types of cancer have not been treated in significant numbers. These regressions can be durable; of 18 patients achieving a complete response, ten have not experienced recurrence at intervals from 18 to 52 months. Although combinations of IL-2 with TNF do not appear to result in increased responses, there is a suggestion in our initial phase I studies that the combination of a-IFN and IL-2 is more effective than the administration of cytokine alone and this combination deserves further study. Similarly the adoptive transfer of TIL in conjunction with IL-2 also appears to be more effective than the use of IL-2 alone. The toxic side effects in patients treated with high- dose IL-2 are presented and include malaise, nausea and vomiting, hypotension, fluid retention, and organ dysfunction. Treatment-related deaths were seen in 1% of all treatment courses and in 1.5% of patients.

Both platinum analogs were given every 28 days with starting doses of 400 mg/m2 for carboplatin (340 mg/m2 if the patient underwent prior radiation) and 270 mg/m2 for iproplatin (230 mg/m2 if the patient underwent prior radiation). These doses are equivalent to cisplatin doses of 75 to 100 mg/m2. Hematologic toxicity was dose-limiting, among which thrombocytopenia was slightly more common than leukopenia. Gastrointestinal toxicity was also prominent with both agents; however, iproplatin was significantly more toxic than carboplatin (P less than .001). Renal, otic, and peripheral nervous system toxicities were absent or infrequent with both analogs. No electrolyte abnormalities were observed. The percentage of planned dosages that were actually administered was 100% of carboplatin doses and 85% of iproplatin doses (P less than .0001). The reduction in iproplatin dose was apparently due to gastrointestinal toxicity. Response rates were similar for both agents (15% for carboplatin, 11% for iproplatin) and appear to be inferior to those noted with the parent compound, cisplatin</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1137"><COL><DATA> In this study, 331 patients with advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix no longer amenable to control with surgery or radiotherapy were randomized to receive cisplatin 50 mg/m2 as either a continuous infusion over 24 hr or a more rapid infusion at a rate of 1 mg/min. Antiemetic therapy was standardized for the initial course of both regimens as metoclopramide 60 mg at the time of and at 3 and 6 hours after initiation of cisplatin. The overall frequency of objective regression of disease was 18%; the response rate in each regimen was essentially identical. The continuous infusion regimen was associated with a significantly greater percentage of patients who experienced no nausea and vomiting (34% versus 18%, P = 0.002).

Between November 1973 and July 1982, 123 women younger than 70 years of age and at clinical Stages I and II were enrolled. Of the total series, 112 were treated by the same surgeon and confirmed pathologically as having invasive mammary carcinoma. In this more homogeneous subgroup, the 10-year survival rates (and standard errors) were for RDL, 60% (+/- 7%) and for EXT, 74% (+/- 6%) (P value for comparison of survival curves = 0.13). In patients from this subgroup with central-medial tumors, comprising 62% of the total, survival after RDL at 10 years was 60% (+/- 8%), and after EXT 86% (+/- 6%) (P = 0.025). In the remaining patients with lateral tumors, survival rates were unaffected by treatment: 58% (+/- 13%) and 56% (+/- 11%), respectively (P = 0.62).

Women with positive axillary nodes received adjuvant chemotherapy. Lumpectomy followed by irradiation resulted in a five- year survival rate of 85 percent, as compared with 76 percent for total mastectomy, a rate of survival free of distant disease of 76 percent, as compared with 72 percent, and a disease-free survival rate of 72 percent, as compared with 66 percent. In the current study, we have extended our observations through eight years of follow-up. Ninety percent of the women treated with breast irradiation after lumpectomy remained free of ipsilateral breast tumor, as compared with 61 percent of those not treated with irradiation after lumpectomy (P less than 0.001). Among patients with positive axillary nodes, only 6 percent of those treated with radiation and adjuvant chemotherapy had a recurrence of tumor in the ipsilateral breast. Lumpectomy with or without irradiation of the breast resulted in rates of disease-free survival (58 +/- 2.6 percent), distant-disease-free survival (65 +/- 2.6 percent), and overall survival (71 +/- 2.6 percent) that were not significantly different from those observed after total mastectomy (54 +/- 2.4 percent, 62 +/- 2.3 percent, and 71 +/- 2.4 percent, respectively). There was no significant difference in the rates of distant-disease-free survival (P = 0.2) or survival (P = 0.3) among the women who underwent lumpectomy (with or without irradiation), despite the greater incidence of recurrence of tumor in the ipsilateral breast in those who received no radiation. We conclude that our observations through eight years are consistent with the findings at five years and that these new findings continue to support the use of lumpectomy in patients with Stage I or II breast cancer. We also conclude that irradiation reduces the probability of local recurrence of tumor in patients treated with lumpectomy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="198"><COL><DATA> Ninety-six patients with operable epidermoid cancer of the esophagus were entered into a phase III, random assignment study designed to compare the efficacy of two preoperative approaches (chemotherapy [CT] or radiation therapy [RT]). Major study end points were objective response rates, surgical outcome, and recurrence pattern. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either two cycles of cisplatin, vindesine, and bleomycin or 55 Gy of radiation before a planned surgical procedure. Postoperative crossover therapy (radiation to those receiving preoperative CT and vice versa) was given to patients with T3Nany or unresectable tumors. Objective response rates of the primary tumor to preoperative therapy were similar (RT 64%, CT 55%), as were operability rates (RT 77%, CT 75%), resection rates (RT 65%, CT 58%), and operative mortality (RT 13.5%, CT 11.1%). Significantly higher doses of CT could be administered when CT was given as initial therapy, rather than after RT/surgery. Local failure or persistence occurred in 33% of operable patients. The median survival for all patients was 11 months; 20% remain alive without disease (median follow-up, 34 months). Because of the crossover design, it was not possible to analyze survival according to the preoperative therapy arm alone. This study suggests that since CT is as effective in treating local tumor as RT, but can also potentially treat systemic disease, investigational programs using CT before surgery as part of initial treatment for localized esophageal cancer should continue. However, if a significant impact on overall survival is to be achieved, more effective chemotherapy regimens or schedules need to be identified.

Forty consecutive patients with oesophageal cancer undergoing retrosternal gastric reconstruction of the oesophagus were studied. In 20 patients the pylorus was left intact (group 1) and 20 patients underwent an Aust pyloroplasty (group 2). Nine patients in group 1 suffered postoperative symptoms of gastric stasis compared with only one patient in group 2 (P = 0.0106). Three patients in group 1 died from aspiration pneumonia before discharge from hospital. A gastric emptying test was performed on 24 patients between 1 and 3 months after surgery. By this time, most survivors had recovered from symptoms attributed to gastric stasis and no significant difference in gastric emptying could be demonstrated between the two groups. Selection of patients, a wide range of emptying times and improvement in gastric emptying on follow-up may explain the lack of correlation between postoperative symptomatology and the gastric half-emptying times.

Patients whose disease progressed on treatment with FUra alone were, if eligible, crossed over to receive leucovorin and FUra. Three patients on the FUra plus leucovorin arm of the study were excluded from the analysis because they did not meet eligibility requirements. The treatment arms were well balanced for prognostic criteria including performance status, age, prior radiotherapy, distribution of metastatic sites, and on-study carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), lactic dehydrogenase, and serum albumin. FUra plus leucovorin was superior to FUra alone for response (P = .0019) and for time to progression or death (log-rank, P = .045). Response rates were 16 of 36 (44%) versus five of 40 (13%), and median time to progression or death was 164 versus 120 days in the two arms of the trial, respectively. Overall survival, however, while longer in the FUra and leucovorin arm was not significantly so. An analysis of the toxicities experienced by the patients in the two treatment groups showed that, except for significantly more stomatitis in the leucovorin arm of the study, the side effects experienced by patients treated with either regimen were comparable.

Patients randomized to CDDP/FU also received CDDP 20 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) bolus on days 1 to 5 of each cycle. Patients were comparable in terms of age, performance status, baseline laboratory values, dominant sites of measurable disease, and percent of liver involvement. The partial response rate was significantly greater in patients who received CDDP/FU versus FU alone (25% v 3%, P = .001). Patients who received CDDP/FU experienced significantly greater toxicity compared with FU alone: grades 3 and 4 hematologic toxicity occurred in 22% and 0% of patients, respectively (P = .0001); grades 2 to 4 nausea and vomiting occurred in 80% and 15% of patients, respectively (P = .0001). There were no significant differences in either the duration of response (median, 6 and 4.7 months for CDDP/FU and FU groups, respectively) or survival (median 10, and 12 months, respectively). Compared with infusional FU alone, CDDP/FU provided a significantly greater partial response rate with increased toxicity, but it did not improve overall survival in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma.

Three hundred seventeen patients were randomized to participate in three trial arms. One group of patients was treated by surgery alone (control group); in the other patients a catheter was placed in the dilated umbilical vein and advanced until the tip was lying in the left branch of the portal vein. Fifty percent of these patients got immediate postoperative portal infusion with 1 g 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5000 U heparin daily for 7 days; the others received portal vein infusion with urokinase 10.000 U/hour for 24 hours only. Three hundred four patients were eligible. Overall hospital mortality was 3.6% (11 patients) and was not influenced by adjuvant treatment. After a median follow-up of 44 months 66 patients have died with relapse and 21 as a result of other causes. The chance of developing liver metastases and other distant metastases after portal infusion with 5-FU/heparin was one third of the chance in the control group (P less than 0.001). Only an insignificant reduction of the average death rate in the 5-FU/heparin group was found. In the urokinase group no significant effect in reducing metastases or in survival was noted.

A reduction was observed in all Dukes&apos; stages. No significant difference between the treatment groups was observed with regard to frequency of distant metastases or overall survival. Among all randomized patients as well as the radically operated patients the recurrence-free interval, i.e., time to local recurrence or distant metastasis, was significantly prolonged in the preoperatively irradiated group. The radically operated patients also had a significantly prolonged survival related to rectal cancer (P = 0.05).

Three hundred nine patients were entered into the trial between May 1976 and December 1985. After radiation no tumor was seen in 4.5% of the patients. There was no increased morbidity or mortality at surgery. The 5-year survival for evaluable patients was 57.5% in the control group and 56.7% in the radiotherapy group. For patients operated on for cure the 5-year survival was 60.9% and 64.2% in the control group and radiotherapy group, respectively. Radiation significantly delayed both local and distant recurrences in patients in the radiation group who had curative resection from 13.3 months in controls to 27.1 months. The local recurrence rate in the corresponding groups was 21.1% and 13.7%, respectively. We conclude that higher preoperative radiation doses should be used in new trials as a higher dosage may transform the observed positive effects into a survival benefit.

The results showed that the high nitrogen infusion associated with metabolic stress indicated by high excretion of urea, high level of serum urea and by a higher frequency of complications.

Median follow-up is 4.1 years; 279 patients had recurrent disease. Time to relapse (TTR) is significantly longer for patients on CMFPT X 12 plus continuous tamoxifen than for CMFPT X 4 (P = .002), or CMFPT X 12 (P = 0.05). Differences between four or 12 cycles of CMFPT are not significant; relapse-free rates at 5 years are 61% for CMFPT X 12 plus continuous tamoxifen, 51% on CMFPT X 12, and 52% on CMFPT X 4. Treatment differences in overall survival are not significant.

Patients showing disease stabilisation or objective response were randomised to stop chemotherapy or to continue until disease progression. At that stage 27% showed partial responses, 3% complete responses, and 10% disease stabilisation. 22 patients were randomised to continue chemotherapy and 21 to stop. There was no difference in time to disease progression, response duration, or survival between the two groups. Toxicity was mild during the first four courses of therapy. Thus, short courses of single-agent chemotherapy can produce similar therapeutic results to long-term chemotherapy, which has major implications for cost, resource allocation, and toxicity of therapy. Stopping chemotherapy early in responders did not cause rapid relapse. Since drug resistance apparently develops early during therapy, new approaches to modify resistance should be more useful than continuous chemotherapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="640"><COL><DATA> Greater amount and duration of postoperative wound drainage after lymphadenectomy impede healing. We evaluated the influence of early vs delayed initiation of shoulder mobilization on postoperative drainage. Fifty-seven women with clinical stage I or II breast cancer were randomized to either early (postoperative day 2) or delayed (postoperative day 5) shoulder motion. Early vs delayed time of exercise initiation had no effect on total amount or duration of drainage, either as an inpatient or outpatient. The two groups were determined to be homogeneous as to age, breast size, weight, height, obesity, previous biopsy, excision of pectoralis minor, excision of thoracodorsal complex, level of axillary dissection, total number of lymph nodes, number of positive lymph nodes, lymphatic vessel invasion (with negative lymph nodes), and whether the dominant hand was on the side operated on. The two factors predicting greater drainage were large numbers of positive lymph nodes and no previous surgical biopsy (as in one-step procedure)</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="648"><COL><DATA> In order to evaluate the possible cardiosparing effect of a prolonged infusion of doxorubicin as compared with the standard mode of administration 62 consecutive patients with metastatic carcinoma of the breast or carcinoma of the ovary Stage III or IV were prospectively randomized to receive doxorubicin either as a rapid infusion over 15 to 20 minutes at 8 AM or as a continuous infusion over 6 hours, 8 AM to 2 PM. The remaining protocol was identical for the two groups. The cardiotoxic effect of doxorubicin was evaluated by history and physical examination and by the decline in resting ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as determined by gated pool radionuclide angiography with technetium 99m (99mTc) and by the decline in the height of the QRS complexes in the standard leads of the echocardiogram (ECG). Initially there were 31 patients in each group. The cumulative dose of doxorubicin, was 410 mg/m2 +/- 42 SD in the standard infusion group and 428 mg/m2 +/- 48 SD in the 6-hour infusion group. The mean decline in LVEF after a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 300 mg/m2 was 17% in the first group and only 4.1% in the second. After 400 mg/m2 the mean fall in LVEF was 21% in the first group and 6% in the second. The mean decline in QRS voltage after 300 mg/m2 was 29% and 1.5%, respectively. Four patients, all in the standard infusion group, developed congestive heart failure. These data suggest that slow infusion of doxorubicin is associated with reduced cardiotoxicity</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="650"><COL><DATA> Antineoplastic Agents,Combined/tu [Therapeutic Use]/Breast Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy]/Cyclophosphamide/ad [Administration &amp; Dosage]/Doxorubicin/ad [Administration &amp; Dosage]/Doxorubicin/ae [Adverse Effects]/Female/Fluorouracil/ad [Administration &amp; Dosage]/Heart/de [Drug Effects]/Human/Myocardial Diseases/ci [Chemically Induced]/Myocardial Diseases/pc [Prevention &amp; Control]/Prospective Studies/Razoxane/tu [Therapeutic Use]/steph</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="731"><COL><DATA> The liver is an estrogen responsive organ. Clinically, estrogens may play a role in the induction of liver tumors and, experimentally, estrogens are involved in the control of hepatocyte proliferation. The results of a prospective controlled clinical trial using an anti-estrogen, tamoxifen, in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are presented below. Thirty-eight consecutive cirrhotics with HCC were allocated to either 30 mg/day tamoxifen or no treatment. The two groups of patients were matched for mean age, male/female ratio, Child-Pugh risk group, approximate tumor volume (US and/or CT scan) and etiology of the underlying cirrhosis. The drug appeared to have no side effects. Survival was significantly prolonged in tamoxifen-treated patients with 22% (vs. 5%) survival at 12 months. No differences were observed between males and females or alcoholic and non-alcoholic cirrhosis. In 53% of tamoxifen-treated patients the levels of alpha-fetoprotein dropped and, in this subgroup, survival was further prolonged. Tumor volume, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase slowly increased, suggesting a slower, but continuous, progression of the disease. In conclusion, anti-estrogen treatment appears effective in the palliation of unresectable or otherwise untreatable HCC. A reduction in alpha-fetoprotein levels appears to be a favorable prognostic index</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="732"><COL><DATA> A randomized trial of hepatic arterial chemoembolization was conducted in 42 patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. These patients represented 41% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma seen during the inclusion period. In the remaining 59%, 9% had resectable tumours and 50% had unresectable tumours with contraindication for chemoembolization. Patients received either repeated chemoembolization with gelfoam powder and doxorubicin (group 1) or symptomatic treatment (group 2). There was no difference in age, prevalence of cirrhosis or staging according to Okuda between the two groups of patients. A complete tumour response (assessed by arteriography, ultrasonography and serum alphafetoprotein) was observed in four patients, and a partial response in three other patients from group 1. Actuarial survival rates were 33 and 24% in group 1 and 52 and 31% in group 2 at 6 and 12 months, respectively (differences were not significant--logrank test). With the treatment used in our study, chemoembolization did not prolong the survival time of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. There were, however, some complete or partial responses. The high spontaneous 1-year survival rate of untreated patients was probably due to the exclusion of the most severely ill patients.

The essential fatty acids (EFAs) exhibit no side-effects when taken as a dietary supplement, even in large doses. Primary Liver Cancer (PLC) is a fatal disease in our area as it is always multifocal in nature. In vitro studies have shown a cytostatic effect of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) on primary liver cancer cells. In a double-blind placebo controlled trial, using Evening Primrose Oil (as a source of GLA) as a dietary supplement in PLC patients, no statistically significant effect was observed on survival time or liver size. There was however a statistical significant beneficial effect on Gamma Glutamyl transferase values as a measure of liver function. No side-effects were observed.

The study population consisted of patients clinically stage I or II (occult) who, after surgical-pathologic evaluation, had one or more risk factors for recurrence: greater than 50% myometrial invasion, pelvic or aortic node metastasis, cervical involvement, or adnexal metastases. All patients without aortic node metastasis received 5000 rads to the whole pelvis at 160-180 rads per day. If aortic node metastasis was documented, aortic field radiation to the top of T12 was offered. The aortic target dose was 4500 rads at 150 rads per day. After completion of radiation therapy, the patients were randomized to receive doxorubicin bolus therapy (60 mg/m2 starting dose) to a maximum cumulative dose of 500 mg/m2. Between November 1977 and July 1986, 92 patients were entered into the doxorubicin (DOX) treatment arm, and 89 patients entered the no-DOX arm. There was no statistically significant difference in survival or progression-free interval of the two arms. The 5-year survival rates for patients with deep myometrial invasion, cervical involvement, and pelvic node metastases were similar (63-70%), whereas the rate for patients with aortic node metastases was 26%. There was no significant difference in the recurrence pattern between the two treatment arms. There were no cases of grade 3 or 4 cardiac toxicity. Twelve patients (6.9%) developed small bowel obstruction after radiation therapy. There were three treatment-related deaths in the DOX arm and two in the radiation therapy-only arm. We conclude that, because of protocol violations, small sample size, and the number of patients lost to follow-up, this study was unable to determine what effect use of doxorubicin as adjuvant therapy had on recurrence, progression, and survival of the endometrial cancer study population.

This study found that the size of the tumor was a highly significant risk factor for death caused by metastasis of uveal melanomas.

The presence of this antibody response to cell surface antigens has been correlated with a better clinical outcome when melanoma patients are treated with an allogeneic melanoma cell vaccine (MCV) as an active immunotherapy protocol. It was hypothesized that the inability to consistently induce or enhance existing immune responses to melanoma-associated antigens was related to the downregulation by suppressor cells. Patients received treatments of MCV 3 times in a 4-week interval and then every fourth week. The biological response modifier cyclophosphamide (CYP) is an immunomodulator of suppressor T-cell function. In this study we set out to determine whether CYP given prior to MCV could reduce suppressor cell activity during vaccination. In a randomized trial stage II and III melanoma patients (n = 41) were given MCV alone or in conjunction with CYP at dosages of 300, 150, or 75 mg/m2. CYP was given 3 days prior to each MCV treatment. Suppressor cell activity in patients was monitored by a concanavalin A suppressor assay using peripheral blood lymphocytes from serial phlebotomies during a 12-week period of treatment. In each trial group there were patients who had major reduction in suppressor cell activity (greater than 50%). Overall, the greatest reduction in suppressor cell activity occurred in patients receiving 300 mg/m2 CYP compared to the other CYP dosages or MCV alone. For the first two treatments at all CYP dosages there was a greater number of patients showing reduced suppressor cell activity compared to later treatments. In a comparison of patients receiving MCV alone to MCV + CYP 300 mg/m2 phenotypic analysis of lymphocyte subsets showed significant (P = 0.03) reduction in the CD8+CD11B+ (suppressor) cells of the latter group. These studies suggest that CYP can be used at low dosages in conjunction with MCV to reduce suppressor cell activity</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="933"><COL><DATA> Antineoplastic Agents/ad [Administration &amp; Dosage]/Antineoplastic Agents/tu [Therapeutic Use]/Combined Modality Therapy/Extremities/Human/Hyperthermia,Induced/Hyperthermia,Induced/mt [Methods]/Melanoma/Melanoma/dt [Drug Therapy]/Perfusion/Support,Non-U.S.Gov&apos;t</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="982"><COL><DATA>In previous Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG) reports, gastric cancer patients with locally unresectable disease, treated with combined radiation and chemotherapy had a shorter median survival (40 weeks) but more remained alive at 4 years (18%) when compared to those randomized to receive chemotherapy alone (76 weeks and 6%, respectively). To further test the concept that combined modality therapy might increase the number of long-term survivors, a second protocol was designed, but with three major modifications. A course of chemotherapy would precede the 5-fluorouracil-potentiated radiation therapy. Doxorubicin would be added to the 5-fluorouracil plus methyl-CCNU combination. Radiation therapy would be given as a single course of 4320 cGy, with 5-fluorouracil given daily for 3 days at the beginning and end of the course. Median survival of 46 patients treated with chemotherapy alone was 59 weeks, with 11% alive after 3 years.

Treatment was moderately well tolerated by the majority of patients, the common side effects being nausea and vomiting (58%) and alopecia (57%). Three possible treatment-related deaths were seen, all due to cardiac failure. At median follow-up of 68 months, 164 patients have died, 73 in the treated arm and 91 in the control arm. There was no significant difference in disease-free or overall survival between the two arms of the study (P = 0.21). There is some evidence that patients with more advanced carcinoma (T3-T4) derived some benefit from treatment (P = 0.04). The interpretation of this finding must take into account that all subgroups were defined retrospectively, and this could, therefore, be a chance finding.

Analysis of oestrogen receptor activity in the carcinomas was not performed. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups according to age, Karnofsky performance index, tumour node metastasis (TNM) stage, operative treatment or other patient characteristics. The tamoxifen or placebo treatment continued to death or to 10 months after accrual into the trial was stopped.

These values did not differ statistically from the 192 and 122 days, respectively, observed in the placebo group. Additional retrospective analyses of sex and stage revealed no beneficial effect of tamoxifen upon survival.

Women were randomized among three treatment groups: (1) TAM alone, (2) Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), cyclophosphamide, and TAM (ACT), or (3) melphalan (L- PAM), fluorouracil (5-FU), and TAM (PFT). The PFT arm was later modified so that new patients also received Adriamycin (PAFT). Findings from 1,124 eligible patients through 3 years of follow-up indicated a significantly better DFS for ACT-treated patients than for those receiving TAM alone (84% v 67%; P = .0004). An advantage in DDFS and S was also observed after ACT therapy (83% v 73% [P = .04 in the former] and 93% v 85% [P = .04 in the latter]). Both the DFS and DDFS of PAFT- treated patients were better than in those treated by TAM alone (83% v 66%, P = .0002 and 85% v 73%, P = .003). PFT patients also fared better in DFS and DDFS than TAM patients (81% v 72%, P = .07 and 85% v 74%, P = .02). Odds ratios consistently favored the three TAM-plus- chemotherapy groups. No significant S advantage is as yet evident in favor of the PAFT or PFT groups. Of importance is the failure of these studies to demonstrate an unfavorable interaction between the drug regimens used and the TAM, which was administered simultaneously. The findings related to the use of PAFT and PFT are of more biologic than clinical significance since L-PAM is rarely used in the treatment of breast cancer.

Clinically apparent or surgically involved para-aortic nodes were reason for exclusion from the study. Pelvic irradiation consisted of 1.6-1.8 Gy per day for 5 days per week to a total of 40-50 Gy. Para-aortic irradiation delivered 44 to 45 Gy in 1.6-1.8 Gy per day, 5 days per week. Pelvic irradiation was to be completed in 4 1/2 to 6 1/2 weeks and para-aortic irradiation in 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 weeks. Intracavitary brachytherapy delivered a total of 4000-5000 mg hr of radium-equivalents or 30-40 Gy to point A. Patients were stratified prior to random treatment assignment by histology, para-aortic nodal status (negative vs. unevaluated), and FIGO stage. As of June 1, 1989, 30 cases were excluded, including five patients who were inevaluable. Two patients who refused the assigned treatment were also excluded. Therefore, a total of 330 cases were analyzable. At 5 years the estimates of survival, the primary endpoint, for the pelvic only and pelvic plus para-aortic irradiation arms are 55% and 65%, respectively (p = 0.043).

A second aim was to determine whether AC followed in 6 months by intravenous (IV) CMF was more effective than AC without reinduction therapy. Through 3 years of follow-up, findings from 2,194 patients indicate no significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS, P = .5), distant disease-free survival (DDFS, P = .5) or survival (S, P = .8) among the three groups. Since the outcome from AC and CMF was almost identical, the issue arises concerning which regimen is more appropriate for the treatment of breast cancer patients. AC seems preferable since, following total mastectomy, AC was completed on day 63 versus day 154 for conventional CMF; patients visited health professionals three times as often for conventional CMF as for AC; women on AC received therapy on each of 4 days versus on each of 84 days for conventional CMF; and nausea-control medication was given for about 84 days to conventional CMF patients versus for about 12 days to patients on AC. The difference in the amount of alopecia between the two treatment groups was less than anticipated. While alopecia was almost universally observed following AC therapy, 71% of the CMF patients also had hair loss and, in 41%, the loss was greater than 50%.

Isolated surgical treatment (119 patients) was compared with surgical treatment followed by radiation therapy (102 patients). Randomization was performed according to the results of pathologic examination of all resected lymph nodes. Patients were divided into three groups: N0, no lymph node invasion; N+1, invasion of paraesophageal lymph nodes, and N+2, invasion of distal lymph nodes (recurrent, tracheal and celiac). All patients included in this trial had a curative esophageal resection. In the group receiving radiation therapy (102 patients), a total dose of 45 to 55 Grays was delivered in the mediastinal, right and left supraclavicular areas and also to the celiac area when celiac lymph node invasion was present. Two hundred and twenty-one patients were randomized and observed from three to nine years; life table method (log rank method) was used to compare survival and local recurrence. In all patients studied, the survival rate was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) in patients without lymph node invasion (group N0) than in patients with lymph node invasion (groups N+1 and N+2).

Pretreatment characteristics were similar in the three groups. There was no procedure-related mortality. There were eight total complications related to the tube and none related to laser treatment (p = 0.02). Mean survival was 119 days in the AT group, 72 days in the AT/RT group, and 169 days in the L/RT arm (p = not significant). Quality of survival was most dependent on swallowing ability, and the swallowing score increased by 2.3 units in the AT group, 1.8 units in the AT/RT group, and 1.4 units in the L/RT group (p = not significant). Adding RT to laser therapy significantly increased time in treatment (mean, 38.7 days) when compared with the AT group (mean, 12.5 days) (p less than 0.001). However, only 1 patient required repeat laser ablation. It is concluded that AT and L/RT result in good palliation as measured by relief of dysphagia and survival time. However, morbidity of AT is significantly greater than that of L/RT.

Thirty-one patients were randomized to the RT regimen and 28 to the RT + CT regimen. The complete local response rate was 58% for the RT group and 75% for the RT + CT group (P = 0.77). The median duration of response was 8 months for both groups. The overall 5-year survival rates were 6% and 16% (P = 0.16) for the RT and RT + CT groups, respectively. Acute toxicities were more pronounced in the RT + CT group. This clinical trial did not detect a difference in outcome with combined-technique therapy.

It was designed as a prospective, randomised, multicentre trial in the United Kingdom, after staging as potentially operable, and it was planned to enter 100 patients per annum for 4 years, with a minimum follow-up of 5 years, after pre-entry staging of patients under 75 years of age by barium swallow, chest radiographs, oesophagoscopy, biopsy, bronchoscopy and CT scanning. The protocol was published in July 1986; the trial started in January 1987 and was stopped in June 1988 when only 31 patients from 16 centres were entered, although 30 centres had ethical committees&apos; approval and were willing to start the trial. Interventions were to be as follows: 1. Surgery. According to the practice of that particular surgeon and classified as (a) curative resection if the surgeon considered that no macroscopic tumour was left behind, and (b) palliative if incompletely resected. 2. Radiotherapy. (a) Prescribed minimum corrected tumour dose of 5000 cGy with daily dose of 250 cGy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. (b) Prescribed minimum corrected tumour dose of 6000 cGy with daily dose of 200 cGy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks. The endpoint was to be survival at 1, 2 and 5 years. The trial was discontinued after 18 months because of lack of recruitment and thus the question whether operable squamous cell cancer of the oesophagus, staged before treatment with CT scanning, is to be treated by radiotherapy or surgical resection remains unanswered.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="230"><COL><DATA> The purpose of this study was to compare surgical stapling and manual suturing techniques with respect to the incidence of tumour recurrence in patients with colorectal cancer: 294 patients undergoing potentially curative resections for colorectal cancer were randomly allocated to receive sutured (n = 142) or stapled (n = 152) anastomoses. The mean (s.e.m.) incidence of tumour recurrence at the end of 24 months was 29.4(4.4) per cent in the sutured group, compared with 19.1(3.9) per cent in the stapled group (P less than 0.05). The corresponding rates for cancer-specific mortality at 24 months were 22.3(4.1) per cent and 10.9(3.0) per cent respectively (P less than 0.01). A multiple regression analysis revealed that the influence of anastomotic technique on recurrence and mortality rate was independent of tumour stage.

Cycles were repeated every 15 days. All patients receiving treatment were evaluable for toxicity and survival, and 118 patients were evaluable for response. The objective regression rate (complete plus partial response) was 12% (7 of 58) in arm A and 28% in arm B (p = 0.049). No change was observed in 24% (14 of 58) in arm A and in 35% (21 of 60) in arm B (p = 0.28), while progressive disease was registered in 64% (37 of 58) and 37% (22 of 60) in arms A and B, respectively (p = 0.006). Median duration of response was 3 months in arm A and 5 months in arm B (p = 0.39). The median survival was 8.3 months in arm A and 11.2 months in arm B (p = 0.25). No statistically significant differences were found when objective regression and survival were related to site of primary tumor, performance status, and number of involved organs. There were two drug-related deaths in arm B due to severe myelosuppression followed by mucositis and sepsis. Of nonhematologic toxicities, diarrhea was more frequently observed in arm B, as were mucositis and infectious complications.

Patients in Group B (n. 30) were given cefuroxime (1.5 g i.v.) plus metronidazole (0.5 g i.v.) at the time of anesthesia and two other administrations of the combined antibiotics (cefuroxime 0.75 g plus metronidazole 0.5 g i.v.) every 8 hours.

DESIGN--Randomised study from February 1986; randomisation to neutron treatment or photon treatment was unstratified and in the ratio of 3 to 1 until January 1988, when randomisation was in the ratio 1 to 1 and stratified by site of tumour. SETTING--Mersey regional radiotherapy centre at Clatterbridge Hospital, Wirral. PATIENTS--151 patients with locally advanced, non-metastatic pelvic cancer (27 cervical, 69 of the bladder, seven prostatic, and 48 of the rectum). INTERVENTION--Randomisation to neutron treatment was stopped in February 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Patient survival and causes of death in relation to the development of metastatic disease and treatment related morbidity. RESULTS--In the first phase of the trial 42 patients were randomised to neutron treatment and 14 to photon treatment, and in the second phase 48 to neutron treatment and 47 to photon treatment. The relative risk of mortality for photons compared with neutrons was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.40 to 1.10) after adjustment for site of tumour and other important prognostic factors. Short term and long term complications were similar in both groups.

Radiation therapy as an adjunct to surgery for rectal cancer has been shown to reduce local recurrence but has not improved survival. In a previous study, combined radiation and chemotherapy improved survival significantly as compared with surgery alone, but not as compared with adjuvant radiation, which many regard as standard therapy. We designed a combination regimen to optimize the contribution of chemotherapy, decrease recurrence, and improve survival as compared with adjuvant radiation alone. METHODS. Two hundred four patients with rectal carcinoma that was either deeply invasive or metastatic to regional lymph nodes were randomly assigned to postoperative radiation alone (4500 to 5040 cGy) or to radiation plus fluorouracil, which was both preceded and followed by a cycle of systemic therapy with fluorouracil plus semustine (methyl-CCNU). RESULTS. After a median follow-up of more than seven years, the combined therapy had reduced the recurrence of rectal cancer by 34 percent (P = 0.0016; 95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 50 percent). Initial local recurrence was reduced by 46 percent (P = 0.036; 95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 70 percent), and distant metastasis by 37 percent (P = 0.011; 95 percent confidence interval, 9 to 57 percent). In addition, combined therapy reduced the rate of cancer-related deaths by 36 percent (P = 0.0071; 95 percent confidence interval, 14 to 53 percent) and the overall death rate by 29 percent (P = 0.025; 95 percent confidence interval, 7 to 45 percent). Its acute toxic effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. These effects were seldom severe. Severe, delayed treatment-related reactions, usually small-bowel obstruction requiring surgery, occurred in 6.7 percent of all patients receiving radiation, and the frequencies of these complications were comparable in both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS. The combination of postoperative local therapy with radiation plus fluorouracil and systemic therapy with a fluorouracil-based regimen significantly and substantively improves the results of therapy for rectal carcinoma with a poor prognosis, as compared with postoperative radiation alone</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="460"><COL><DATA> In familial adenomatous polyposis, sulindac-induced polyp regression has been reported by several authors. In this study, the goal was to confirm these results by a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study in 10 patients with rectal polyps that had been previously treated by colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis. Patients received sulindac, 300 mg/day, or placebo during two 4-month periods separated by a 1-month wash-out phase. One patient was not compliant and was excluded. With sulindac, the authors observed a complete (6 patients) or almost complete (3 patients) regression of the polyps. With placebo, the authors observed an increase (5 patients), no change (2 patients), and a relative decrease (2 patients) in the number of polyps. The difference between sulindac and placebo was statistically significant (P less than 0.01). In biopsy specimens of polyps and normal rectal mucosa of 6 patients, the authors conducted an immunohistochemical study of the cellular proliferation index using the Ki 67 monoclonal antibody (Ki 67 index), at the beginning and at the end of each treatment period. They were not able to show a sulindac-induced modification of the Ki 67 index.

Patients who had undergone a potentially curative resection were randomized either to no further treatment (NO RT) or to pelvic radiotherapy (RT), 45 Gy in 25 fractions (plus a perineal boost of 5 Gy in 2 fractions after abdomino-perineal resection). The trial was prematurely terminated in December 1985 owing to slow accrual after 70 patients had been randomized: 36 patients to RT and 34 patients to NO RT. Two patients in each group were found to be ineligible after randomization and, for a variety of reasons, thirteen patients who were randomized to RT did not receive that treatment. The incidence of post-operative complications were comparable in both groups, indicating that radiotherapy produced no additional problems. Radiotherapy-related morbidity comprised mainly diarrhoea (grade 1 = 2/21; grade 2 = 5/21; grade 3 = 0/21; grade 4 = 1/21). There were no deaths due to radiotherapy and only one patient, with grade 4 diarrhoea, failed to complete the prescribed course of radiotherapy. After an average follow-up period of 52 months there were 15 local recurrences, 8 in the RT group and 7 in the NO RT group, giving an actuarial 2 year local recurrence rate of 16%.

The main reason for this infection is that systemically administered antibiotic prophylaxis does not reach sufficiently high concentrations of antibiotic in the tissue of the sacroperineal wound. Since gentamicin-polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in the form of chains of beads has been confirmed as a useful tool in the treatment of local infection in bone and soft tissue surgery, we have evaluated its effect on the abdominoperineal rectum excision in a prospective, randomized trial. Forty-four patients with rectal or anal carcinoma entered the study. Only patients with stage Dukes D were excluded from the trial. Following randomized selection, the patients were treated either with local gentamicin and drainage (Group A) or drainage alone (Group B), using the Lloyd-Davies procedure. The two groups were comparable regarding age, sex, tumor stage and level, and risk factors predisposing for an infectious complication (anemia, nutritional status, blood transfusion). The postoperative mortality rate was 0% in both series. Analysis of local perineal wound healing revealed a statistically significant higher percentage of primary wound healing in Group A than in Group B (87% versus 46%; p less than 0.01). This led to a significantly shorter hospitalization period for patients in Group A (p less than 0.01).

One hundred seventy-two patients who had undergone surgical resection for rectal adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned to either treatment consisting of external irradiation to a dose of 5000 cGy in 5 weeks or a control group (no adjuvant therapy). It was assumed that the number of cells remaining after radical surgery would be low and that the dose of 5000 cGy would be adequate in eradicating the majority of those cells. The number of local recurrences was lower in the treated group of patients, but the difference was not statistically significant. It was assumed that if a significant reduction in the number of local recurrences could be obtained, improved (disease-free) survival would result. No influence on disease-free or overall survival could be detected. These results were in agreement with those reported in Europe and the US, and it was concluded that postoperative radiation therapy alone cannot be justified as a routine procedure in the primary management of resectable rectal cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="499"><COL><DATA> In the last 2 years, 50 patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery were prospectively studied about antibiotic prophylaxis.

Ornidazole plus ceftriaxone prophylactic antibiotic therapy is therefore as effective as a classic therapy (metronidazole plus amikacin) and constitutes an alternative choice for patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery, because the simple manner of its administration (once per 24 h) is resulting in cost saving due to gained nursing time</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="520"><COL><DATA> The aim of this multicentric prospective randomized clinical trial was to study the efficacy of hepatic artery ligation (HAL) with and without portal infusion (PI) of 5-FU in patients with liver metastasis of colorectal origin.

Present multicentric randomized trial was conducted to verify whether lonidamine can potentiate the antineoplastic effects of conventional fluorouacil, Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide (FAC) chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. From January 1987 to December 1989, 265 patients were enrolled in this study, and 231 are evaluable for response. After stratification according to institution and ECOG performance status (PS), the patients were randomly allocated to receive either standard FAC therapy (group A) or FAC plus lonidamine (600 mg orally daily three times a day) (group B). After three FAC courses, the patients with no progressive disease were further randomized to either receive continuous treatment up to the time of tumor progression (maximum: 10 courses) or to discontinue therapy when a response &quot;plateau&quot; was reached. In this latter group, the same therapy was restarted at relapse or disease progression. Objective response (complete response plus partial response) was significantly higher in group B (66.3%) compared to group A (42.3%). The actuarial median times to disease progression was also significantly longer (P less than 0.0001) in group B (median 9 months) than in group A (median 6 months). Other than myalgia and gastric pain, no increased toxicity was observed in the lonidamine. The analysis of second randomization are yet available because of the longer follow-up time required.

Estrogen receptor assays were performed on all primary specimens taken of the carcinoma of the breast. Initial treatment for all patients was a modified radical mastectomy. Nine hundred and seventeen patients had negative axillary nodes and were observed without additional therapy. Four hundred and seventy-five had positive nodes and were randomized to receive combination chemoendocrine adjuvant therapy. One thousand and sixty-three (76.4 per cent) of the patients were found to have estrogen receptor positive (ER+) tumors (greater than or equal to 3 femtomoles per milligram cytosol of protein). The ten year over-all survival rate of 65.9 per cent was significantly better than that of 329 (23.6 per cent) patients with estrogen receptor negative (ER-) tumors (less than 3 femtomoles per milligram cytosol protein), who had a ten year over-all survival rate of 56.0 per cent (p = 0.0001). Higher estrogen receptor values were associated with Caucasian (p = 0.0001) and postmenopausal patients (p = 0.0001). In a proportional hazards regression model, patients with ER+ tumors had a significantly longer over-all survival period (p = 0.0001), but only a marginally improved disease-free survival time (p = 0.07) when compared with patients who had ER- tumors. These results indicate that ER determination does have prognostic value for long term over-all survival of patients with carcinoma of the breast.

Patients on study B122 received either cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) or cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil (CAF). On study B141 patients received CAF or mitolactol (dibromodulcitol), doxorubicin and vincristine alternating after every three cycles with three cycles of CMF (DAV/CMF). Long-term follow-up of 172 patients showed no significant survival difference (in multivariate regression models) for treatment with either CMF vs. CAF or CAF vs. DAV/CMF. The difference in median survival times between CMF and CAF showed a trend in favour of CAF.

Between March 1982 and December 1985, 517 patients were enrolled, 257 of whom were treated by RX + AU and 260 with CMF. The main clinical, pathological and prognostic characteristics were equally distributed in the two groups. The present analysis was conducted after a mean follow-up of 69 months (S.D. = 13). There was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) between the two groups (test adjusted by center and menopausal status); the five-year OS rate was 74% in the RXAU group and 77% in the CMF group. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was significantly higher (p = 0.05) in the RXAU group compared to the MCF group; the five-year RFS rates were 57% and 46% in the two groups respectively.

All the patients were first treated for advanced disease. Twenty-two patients received HD MAP (1,000 mg b.i.d. p.o.) and 18 patients received OPX. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 2 (9%) in the HD MAP group and in 2 (11%) in the OPX group for a duration of 20-24 and 30-54 months respectively. Partial remission (PR) was achieved in 10 (45%) patients in the HD MAP group and in 4 (22%) patients in the OPX group for a median duration of 9 and 7 months respectively. The objective response rates (CR + PR) were 55% for the HD MAP group and 33% for the OPX group (p = 0.17). Ten patients who received OPX as first-line treatment received HD MAP when the disease progressed and were evaluable for response: PR was achieved in 6 patients (2 responders and 4 nonresponders to OPX) for a median duration of 5 months. Two out of 4 patients who received OPX at progression after objective response to HD MAP presented PR. HD MAP induced a significant decrease in pain intensity and, compared to OPX, a more frequent improvement was induced in performance status. No difference was observed between the two groups in terms of overall survival.

These complications arise because of progressive osteolysis which is in turn dependent on the activation of osteoclasts by tumour and host tissues. Clodronate is a powerful inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption which led us to evaluate its potential in metastatic breast cancer. When given intravenously it lowers serum calcium in the majority of hypercalcaemic patients. A convenient regimen is 600 mg iv as a single dose infused over several hours. We have additionally shown in a double-blind cross-over study that this regimen also has a significant effect on bone pain. This had led us to assess the longer term effects of clodronate by mouth in a prospective double-blind study of patients with established skeletal metastases. These studies are not yet complete but the agent appears to prevent hypercalcaemia and trends are emerging which indicate that the incidence of bone pain and fractures may also decrease.

Survival and DFS were also analyzed in relation to various prognostic factors. Statistically significant differences were only seen in a subset of 33 patients with lower limb malignant melanoma, the prognosis being better for the chemoimmunotherapy group in this location.

Twenty-three patients with renal cell carcinoma and 20 with melanoma were entered into the protocol. There were no objective responses noted in the 38 assessable patients (20 with renal cell carcinoma, 18 with melanoma). Most patients demonstrated progressive disease following one 31-day cycle of weekly continuous-infusion IL-2. Grade I and II toxic reactions, including fever, rash, anorexia, and weight gain, were common and treated symptomatically.

One group received levamisole 2.5 mg/kg on 2 consecutive days weekly for 3 years, a second group received bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) for 3 years. A third group alternated 8-week courses of BCG and levamisole for 3 years and a fourth group underwent clinical assessment at the same frequency as the three treatment groups. The median duration of follow-up is 8.5 years. The percentage of reduction in the death rate and the recurrence rate in the treatment groups compared with the control group was calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model and adjusted for age, sex, and stage as covariants. The patients treated with levamisole were estimated to have a 29% reduction in both the death rate (P = .08) and the recurrence rate (P = .09) compared with patients receiving no further treatment. Fifty-five patients discontinued levamisole early because of gastrointestinal intolerance or arthralgia, myalgia, fever, and immune leukopenia. The patients treated with BCG alternating with levamisole experienced a 10% reduction in the death rate and a 6% reduction in the recurrence rate, and the patients treated with BCG alone experienced a 4% reduction in the death rate and a 3% increase in the recurrence rate compared with the control group.

All patients in both arms were followed in the same way for 5 years. At 5 years 23 of 37 patients in the control arm and 7 of 33 patients in the treatment arm were dead because of relapse.

A Cox regression model on fixed co-variates (ie, features such as tumour type or size present at surgery and not subsequently alterable) and on IBTR, which is time dependent and not fixed, revealed that the risk of distant disease was 3.41 times greater after adjustment for co-variates in patients in whom an IBTR developed. IBTR proved to be a powerful independent predictor of distant disease. However, it is a marker of risk for, not a cause of, distant metastasis.

For axillary dissection, randomization to multiple drains meant placement of four catheters in the axilla, and randomized to the single drain, one catheter in the axilla. For modified radical mastectomy, the patients randomized to multiple drains received four catheters in the axilla and one catheter under the inferior flap; the patients randomized to single drains had one catheter in the axilla and one catheter under the inferior flap.

Induction therapy consisted of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil with hormonal synchronization using tamoxifen and conjugated estrogens. Local treatment was determined by response to chemotherapy. Patients with a clinical parital response underwent mastectomy followed by local-regional radiotherapy while patients with a clinical complete response were biopsied for pathologic correlation. Those with residual disease received mastectomy followed by radiotherapy while those with a pathologic complete response received radiation only to the intact breast and regional nodes.

Treatment in the radiation arm consisted of full axillary dissection and gross removal of the tumor, followed by 4500 to 5000 cGy to the whole breast and a boost to the tumor bed of 1500 to 2000 cGy. Patients with positive axillary dissections received radiation to the supraclavicular nodes, in addition to cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. Two hundred thirty-seven patients entered in the trial between 1979 and 1987 are available for analysis, 116 in the mastectomy arm and 121 in the radiation arm. With a median follow-up of 67.7 months, there are no significant differences in 5-year overall survival (85% vs 89%, mastectomy vs radiation) or 5-year disease-free survival (82% vs 72%, mastectomy vs radiation). Patients in the radiation arm had an actuarial in-breast recurrence rate of 12% at 5 years and 20% at 8 years. There were no major differences between complication rates in the treatment arms. The results of the study indicate that patients with invasive breast cancer, stage I and II, can be treated with lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and radiation therapy with results comparable to those with modified radical mastectomy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="67"><COL><DATA> The antiemetic response and side effects resulting from treatment with methylprednisolone (MPA) given on two different dose schedules were evaluated in 20 women with breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF). This randomized, crossover, double-blind study compared the antiemetic efficacy of a single dose of 125 mg MPN with that of two such doses. The study demonstrated the superiority of the latter protocol in preventing CMF-induced nausea and vomiting. The rate of antiemetic response to single vs double doses was as to follows: complete protection, 17% vs 30%; partial and minimal protection, 39% vs 55%; and no protection, 44% vs 15% of the courses, respectively (P = 0.0087). No difference in the antiemetic response rate was found between the first and the second course. Treatment with MPN was well tolerated, and no difference in the incidence of side effects was found between the single-dose and the double-dose schedule. We recommend the use of two doses of 125 mg MPN as prophylactic antiemetic treatment in breast-cancer patients receiving CMF chemotherapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="68"><COL><DATA> In 1983, the German Breast Cancer Study Group (GBSG), sponsored by the Federal Ministry of Research and Technology, started a prospective multicenter trial on the treatment of early breast cancer (pT1 pN0 M0). This was preceded by a three-year reviewing period because of some novelties of medical, juristical and ethical problems in the FRG. University and, in the majority, community hospitals participated, combining all together 69 different institutions. From 11/1983 to 12/1989, 1112 patients were recruited. From 1036 patients, 733 underwent breast preservation (71%) and 303 mastectomy (29%). The randomization rate was only 6%. In 268 patients (26%) the tumor size was less than or equal to 10 mm, in 765 patients (74%) 11 to 22 mm. In 129 cases, we subdivided the tumor grading II[3] into IIa and IIb. Moreover, the immunohistochemical detection of the transmembrane proteins EGFR, p-185 and p-148 by oncogene overexpression and c-myc oncogene were undertaken in 425 breast cancers. After tumorectomy (or wide excision) and a lower axillary dissection (at least eight lymph nodes) the breast was irradiated up to 50 Gy in 25 fractions. A boost of 12 Gy was given to the tumor bed. The medial located lymph nodes were also irradiated in case of medially or centrally tumors. Quality control was performed by pathological, radiotherapeutic and methodical reference centers. Significant correlations could be demonstrated between receptor status and tumor grading, patient age and grading, and tumor size and grading. The results emphasize the central role of tumor grading among the prognostic factors. Especially the differentiation of the Bloom and Richardson score II into IIa and IIb seems to play an important role. After a median follow-up of 41 months, the frequency of local recurrences (4.4%), regional recurrences (1%) and distant metastases (4.6%) was exactly the same in both treatment groups. In multivariate analysis, only tumor size and tumor grading had a significant impact on disease-free survival. 23 patients with tumor-involved margins had a higher recurrence rate (DFS 62% versus 85% after five years). Without any impact on DFS were the other conventionally evaluated prognostic factors: age, menopausal status, hormone receptor status, histological tumor type, tumor localisation, degree of differentiation, pleomorphism, mitotic index and degree of dissociation. Among the transmembrane proteins EGFR, p-185, p-148 and c-myc, only the impact of p-185 and EGRF positivity on DSF is significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="69"><COL><DATA> Twenty-four evaluable patients with stage T4 breast cancer were entered into a phase II study and received chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide 1,000 mg m-2 i.v., doxorubicin 50 mg m-2 i.v., vincristine 1.4 mg m-2 i.v. and prednisolone 40 mg orally for 5 days, given 3 weekly for four cycles prior to undergoing loco-regional radiotherapy. All patients completed treatment as planned with no major acute toxicity from either chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Subsequently 52 patients with stage T4 breast cancer were randomised in a phase III trial to receive either radiotherapy alone (RT) or this chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CHOP + RT). A significantly higher complete response rate was achieved in the CHOP + RT treatment arm (P = 0.03). However a larger proportion of the RT arm achieved loco-regional control after salvage treatment for relapse such that 50% of the RT arm and 57% of the CHOP + RT arm had no evidence of loco-regional disease at the time of last follow-up or death. There was no statistical difference in time to distant relapse or overall survival. Analysis of the pilot study showed results comparable to the trial CHOP + RT arm. This trial suggests that this cytotoxic therapy used in conjunction with radiotherapy has only marginal value in improving prognosis in locally advanced breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="70"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Mastectomy versus excisional biopsy (lumpectomy) plus radiation for the treatment of stage I and II breast cancer was compared in a prospective randomized study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1979 to 1987, 247 women were randomized and 237 were treated on this study. All patients received a full axillary dissection and all node-positive patients received adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. Radiation consisted of external-beam therapy to the whole breast with or without supraclavicular nodal irradiation followed by a boost to the tumor bed. RESULTS: The minimum time on the study was 18 months and the median time on the study was 68 months. No differences in overall survival or disease-free survival were observed. Actuarial estimates at 5 years showed that 85% of mastectomy-treated patients were alive compared with 89% of the lumpectomy/radiation patients (P2 = .49; 95% two-sided confidence interval [CI] about this difference, 0% to 9% favoring lumpectomy plus radiation). The probability of failure in the irradiated breast was 12% by 5 years and 20% by 8 years according to actuarial estimates. Of 15 local breast failures, 14 were treated with and 12 were controlled by mastectomy; the ultimate local-regional control was similar in both arms of the trial.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1982 and 1986, 319 consecutive patients with stage II or III breast cancer with one or more positive nodes were assigned randomly to receive adjuvant chemotherapy that consisted of escalating doses of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in combination with vincristine and prednisone or the same chemotherapy regimen followed by 1 year of leukocyte alpha-interferon. Doxorubicin was administered by 72-hour continuous infusion through a central venous catheter (maximum total cumulative dose, 430 mg/m2). All patients with positive or unknown estrogen receptor status were also given tamoxifen for 1 year. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 71 months (range, 35 to 99 months). Correlation of disease-free survival (DFS) with dose-intensity of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin showed no improvement in DFS for patients who were able to receive escalated drug doses compared with those who were not. Doxorubicin administered by continuous infusion was associated with a negligible risk of cardiotoxicity in this study despite the administration of higher accumulative doses than in our previous adjuvant therapy studies. The DFS rates of patients who did and those who did not receive leukocyte alpha-interferon were similar. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, there was no real evidence that higher drug dose intensity was associated with longer DFS. Leukocyte alpha-interferon as it was used in this study had no therapeutic value. Doxorubicin administered by infusion was associated with a reduced risk of cardiotoxicity</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="132"><COL><DATA> Sixty patients with advanced breast cancer unresponsive to tamoxifen have been randomised to receive four course of mitozantrone, 14 mg m-2 (n = 30) intravenously every 3 weeks (9 weeks total) or megesterol acetate, 160 mg bd (n = 30). One in three patients (11 from each group) had substantial disease control for a minimum period of 6 months i.e., lack of progression; seven patients (23%) showed objective response to mitozantrone compared to four (13%) receiving megesterol. Non-progressive disease occurred in all sites, including visceral metastases and receptor negative patients. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the median time (5 months each) to disease progression response duration or survival (13 months megesterol, 11 months mitozantrone) from commencing second-line therapy. Toxicity was considerably higher in the mitozantrone group. Second-line hormonal therapies can produce similar therapeutic results as those achieved from a short course of a &apos;short option&apos; single agent cytotoxic in patients who were previously thought hormone insensitive. Provided that the patient does not have life threatening disease a trial of megesterol acetate is worth consideration in that it does not prejudice subsequent response to combination cytotoxic chemotherapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="133"><COL><DATA> In a prospective randomized clinical trial conducted by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), mastectomy was compared with breast-conserving therapy in 903 stage I and stage II breast cancer patients entering the study between 1980 and 1986. The main participating centers were: Guy&apos;s Hospital, London; The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam; University Hospital, Leuven; Radiotherapy Institute, Rotterdam; Breast Unit, Tijgerberg, S.A. The data were collected in the EORTC Data Center, Brussels. Treatment in the study arm consisted of lumpectomy, axillary clearance, and radiotherapy to the breast (50 Gy external irradiation in 5 weeks followed by boost with iridium implant of 25 Gy). Important in this study is the large number of TNM stage II patients (755). Most patients were stage II because of the size of the tumor (2-5 cm). The patient and tumor characteristics in the study and control groups were well balanced. So far the survival curves and local recurrence rates are not statistically different for the two study arms. Tumor size was found in univariate analysis to be a significant risk factor for local recurrence in the breast-conserving therapy group but not in the mastectomy group. Results of salvage treatment for local recurrence were not better for the breast-conserving therapy group compared with the mastectomy group.

The effects of either of these treatments on arm mobility, pain, or edema have not been compared. To assess the impact of MRM or XRT on mobility, pain, or edema, we evaluated patients treated in a prospective randomized trial designed to assess prognosis following MRM or XRT. All were provided a standardized physical therapy program including arm mobilization, shoulder strengthening, prevention and treatment of upper extremity edema, and education about arm function. Patients were evaluated for chest wall pain, arm motion, muscle strength, and edema as determined by circumferential measurements at the wrist, forearm, and arm. Evaluations were performed preoperatively and at yearly anniversaries of their surgery. Women receiving XRT had more chest wall tenderness at 1 and 2 years after surgery than those receiving MRM (p2 less than 0.0001 and p2 = 0.0007 respectively). Those receiving MRM were slower to reach their preoperative range of motion (ROM) (p2 = 0.043). Incidence of muscle weakness was similar in both groups. The few patients with local recurrence of tumor had more upper extremity edema than those who did not recur (p2 = 0.085) at 1 year and (p2 = 0.02) at 2 years. In patients who did not develop local recurrence, those who had received XRT had greater but nonsignificant increases in upper extremity circumferential measures compared with those receiving MRM at any anniversary evaluation. Patients receiving MRM and XRT are likely to have some differences in functional outcome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="135"><COL><DATA> Axillary dissection in early breast cancer remains controversial because of its substantial side-effects and because its value with respect to recurrence or survival has not been unequivocally proven. Between 1982 and 1987, 658 patients were included in a prospective randomised comparison of lumpectomy alone with lumpectomy plus axillary dissection. All patients had a unilateral breast tumour not exceeding 3 cm in diameter and lymph-node involvement or metastases. Radiation therapy was given to both groups. The two groups of patients were similar with respect to mean age, TNM stage, and presence of hormonal receptors. Median follow-up was 54 months. 5-year survival of the patients was 94.2% (95% Cl: 92.1-96.4). There was a significant advantage in survival in the axillary dissection group (p = 0.014). Recurrence of tumour in the breast was similar in the two groups but visceral metastases, supraclavicular metastases, and lymph-node recurrences were less frequent in the axillary dissection group. Survival was related to the age of the patients (p = 0.005), the presence of positive nodes (p = 0.006), the histological grading (p less than 0.0001), and the presence of hormonal receptors (progesterone p = 0.0008, oestrogen p less than 0.0001). Treatment-adjusted relative risk was 2.4 (95% Cl: 1.3-4.2). The findings show that axillary dissection is justified for treatment of small breast cancers, although whether the better survival is due to axillary clearance itself or to adjuvant treatment for lymph-node involvement is unclear</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="136"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: A randomized study comparing low-dose aminoglutethimide (AG) with and without hydrocortisone (HC) was performed to investigate whether corticosteroid replacement contributes to the therapeutic effects of the drug administered as a front-line endocrine therapy in postmenopausal advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Postmenopausal patients who had not had prior endocrine therapy for advanced disease and with estrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PgR) status positive or unknown were eligible. AG was administered at a dose of 250 mg twice a day orally (125 mg twice a day during the first month) with or without HC (20 mg twice a day orally). Seventy-nine and 74 patients were assessable for response on the AG plus HC arm and on the AG arm, respectively. The two treatment groups were well balanced and patients were largely untreated. Approximately 60% had not received any adjuvant treatment, and approximately 75% had not received any medical treatment after relapse. RESULTS: The overall responses (complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR]) were 44% and 41% for the AG plus HC and the AG arm, respectively, showing no significant difference. Time to progression (median, 8.1 and 6.3 months), duration of response (median, 15.8 and 13.7 months), and duration of survival (median, 34.2 and 36.3 months) were not significantly different between the two treatment arms. Side effects were infrequent and mild in both arms, with no significant differences. CONCLUSION: We conclude that half of the conventional daily dose of AG has optimal therapeutic activity as a front-line endocrine treatment of postmenopausal advanced breast cancer and that HC does not significantly contribute to the therapeutic effects</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="147"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: With the aim of improving the results of treatment of esophageal cancer, we designed this multi-institutional, randomized trial to establish the optimal irradiation method in radical radiation therapy for esophageal cancer by clinically evaluating external irradiation alone and in combination with intraluminal brachytherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study population consisted of patients with squamous cell carcinoma who were expected to be successfully treated with radical radiation therapy. The patients who could be given intraluminal brachytherapy at the end of external irradiation of 60 Gy were stratified into 2 groups. Patients assigned to receive external irradiation alone received boost irradiation of 10 Gy/week on a schedule similar to the previous one, and with the same or smaller irradiation field. Intraluminal brachytherapy was performed, as a rule, with the reference dose point set at a depth of 5 mm of the esophageal submucosa, and a total of 10 Gy was irradiated at a daily dose of 5 Gy, on a once-weekly schedule with low-dose-rate or high-dose-rate brachytherapy equipment. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients were registered, 94 of whom were analyzable, with 8 ineligible, and 1 for whom complete information was unavailable. The overall cumulative survival rate was 20.3% at 5 years. The cause-specific survival rate was 31.8% at 5 years. The cause-specific survival rate at 5 years was 27% in the external irradiation alone group and 38% in intraluminal brachytherapy combined group. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups (p = 0.385). However, in the patients with 5 cm or less tumor length, the cause-specific survival rate was 64% at 5 years in the intraluminal brachytherapy combined group, which showed a significant improvement over 31.5% in the external irradiation alone group (p = 0.025). In the patients with Stage T1 and T2 disease, cause-specific survival rates tended to be better in the intraluminal brachytherapy combined group than in the external irradiation alone group (p = 0.088). In the patients with more than 5 cm tumor length or Stage T3-4 disease, there were no significant differences between the two groups by treatment methods (p = 0.290). The incidence of early and late complications did not differ according to whether intraluminal brachytherapy was used. CONCLUSION: For the purpose of establishing the usefulness of intraluminal brachytherapy, further prospective randomized studies are necessary to evaluate the efficacy in tumors with short length and those with shallow invasion, or to assess the usefulness of intraluminal brachytherapy, as additional irradiation in large advanced tumors have been shown to have disappeared by diagnostic imaging after chemoradiotherapy with 60 Gy/6w external irradiation</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="151"><COL><DATA> Squamous carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus has an extremely poor prognosis.

From Group 1 patients, 47 were subjected to radiotherapy (conventional) and had endoscopic dilatation and/or intubation whenever and wherever required (Group 1a), and 43 patients were allowed to follow the natural course of the disease except palliation with endoscopic dilatation and/or intubation whenever and wherever required (Group 1b). From Group 2, 4 patients received radiotherapy in addition to endoscopic intubation, while 10 patients received only endoscopic intubation. RESULTS: The median survival for Group 1a was 7 months, for Group 1b--3 months, for Group 2a--4.25 months, and Group 2b--3.6 months. Only three patients from Group 1a survived more than 18 months, while no patient from Groups 1b, 2a, or 2b survived for more than 1 year. The difference in survival between Group 1a and 1b was statistically significant.

A priori, 13 patients chose chemotherapy before surgery and 18 patients chose surgery only. The complete chemotherapy program consisted of three cycles with fluorouracil, 1 g/m2 per day for 5 days, and cisplatin, 20 mg/m2 per day for 5 days. The response rate to chemotherapy was 50% (17 of 34 patients). Side effects of therapy were higher than expected based on results of previous phase II studies. Two drug-related deaths were observed. The resectability rate for patients in the surgery only group was 79% (33 of 42 patients) compared with 70% (19 of 27 patients) for patients receiving chemotherapy. The postoperative rates of septic complications (41% [11 of 27 patients] vs 26% [11 of 42 patients]) and respiratory disorders (48% [13 of 27 patients] vs 31% [13 of 42 patients]) were higher for patients with preoperative chemotherapy than for those treated with surgery only. Surgery-related mortality was increased in the chemotherapy group (19% [five of 27 patients]) compared with the surgery only group (10% [four of 42 patients]). Patients responding to preoperative chemotherapy had prolonged survival (median, 13 months) compared with nonresponders (median, 5 months), but the median survival for the chemotherapy group and the surgery only group was identical (10 months).

The efficacy of conventional treatment with surgery and radiation for cancer of the esophagus is limited. The median survival is less than 10 months, and less than 10 percent of patients survive for 5 years. Recent studies have suggested that combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy may result in improved survival. METHODS. This phase III prospective, randomized, and stratified trial was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of four courses of combined fluorouracil (1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area daily for four days) and cisplatin (75 mg per square meter on the first day) plus 5000 cGy of radiation therapy, as compared with 6400 cGy of radiation therapy alone, in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the thoracic esophagus. The trial was stopped after the accumulated results in 121 patients demonstrated a significant advantage for survival in the patients who received chemotherapy and radiation therapy. RESULTS. The median survival was 8.9 months in the radiation-treated patients, as compared with 12.5 months in the patients treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In the former group, the survival rates at 12 and 24 months were 33 percent and 10 percent, respectively, whereas they were 50 percent and 38 percent in the patients receiving combined therapy (P less than 0.001). Seven patients in the radiotherapy group and 25 in the combined-therapy group were alive at the time of the analysis. The patients who received combined treatment had fewer local (P less than 0.02) and fewer distant (P less than 0.01) recurrences. Severe and life-threatening side effects occurred in 44 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of the patients who received combined therapy, as compared with 25 percent and 3 percent of those treated with radiation alone. CONCLUSIONS. Concurrent therapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil and radiation is superior to radiation therapy alone in patients with localized carcinoma of the esophagus, as measured by control of local tumors, distant metastases, and survival, but at the cost of increased side effects</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="191"><COL><DATA> During a 2 1/2-year period, 60 consecutive patients with cancer of the thoracic esophagus were randomized to undergo a cervical or thoracic anastomosis. The tumors were staged postoperatively (stage I, n = 2; stage II, n = 19; stage III, n = 9; and stage IV, n = 30) and were almost equally distributed between the two groups. The upper limit of three tumors was above the convexity of the aortic arch. The esophageal specimens were studied with regard to measurements of the tumor and of the resected esophagus. The microscopic aspects were evaluated by serial sections after vital staining. The prevalence of ignored plurifocal cancers, of submucosal infiltrations, and of distant areas of dysplasia in both groups was confirmed. Malignant invasions of esophageal sections were more frequent in patients undergoing thoracic anastomosis (10 versus 3), and diseased upper mediastinal lymph nodes were more frequent in those undergoing cervical anastomosis (17 versus 7). Mortality was equally divided between the two groups. Respiratory complications and recurrent laryngeal trauma were more frequent in patients having cervical anastomosis. Long-term survivors had stage N0 disease, with a healthy esophageal section. Even though subtotal esophagectomy reduces the prevalence of microscopic esophageal wall invasion above the tumor and allows more complete unilateral exploration and resection of invaded lymph nodes, it offers no significant benefit concerning survival of patients with advanced cancer and malignant lymphadenopathy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="203"><COL><DATA> From June 1977 to May 1985, a prospective randomized clinical trial on pre-operative radiation for esophageal carcinoma was carried out in 206 patients. Lesions under 8 cm in length and patients younger than 65 years, at least on semi-liquid diet and not contra-indicated for surgery were randomized into a combined group (104 patients) or a surgery alone group (102 patients). Eight MV X ray units were used for the pre-operative radiation using A-P portals to deliver 4,000 cGy to the whole mediastinum and the left gastroepiploic lymphatic chain. Surgery was carried out after 2 to 4 week&apos;s rest. The immediate results of the combined group and the surgery alone group were: resection rate 93% and 85%, operative mortality 5% and 6%, intra-thoracic anastomotic leak 0% and 1%, positive pathology at the esophageal stump 0% and 2%, and lymph nodes metastasis 27% and 35% respectively. The 5-year survival rates of the combined group and the surgery alone group were 35% and 30%. We have noticed that those patients with lesions showing radiation reaction of grade III gave a 5-year survival of 50% (12/24). Because intra- and extra-thoracic lymphnode metastasis caused failures (41% and 34% of these two groups), increasing the preoperative tumor dose to 60 Gy or designing post-operative irradiation to cover the bilateral supraclavicular areas was necessary. The whole mediastinum and the left gastroepiploic lymphatics could further improve the results of surgery. Further studies are needed</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="204"><COL><DATA> Between May 1976 and January 1982, 170 patients were entered in a randomized study comparing a combined treatment consisting of methotrexate followed by irradiation versus radiotherapy alone in patients with non metastatic inoperable oesophageal cancer. Methotrexate was administered subcutaneously in 4 days to a total dose of 24 mg/m2. Radiotherapy was performed, in both groups, at a dose of 56.25 Gy in 25 fractions (5 weeks). The administration of methotrexate did not lead to an increased intolerance to radiotherapy but severe hematological toxicities were observed in 7.8% of the cases. No difference in the duration of survival was detected. Initial performance status of the patients and their weight loss prior to entry on trial were the factors that were most predictive of the patient&apos;s prognosis</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="245"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To evaluate the contribution of semustine (MeCCNU) to adjuvant benefit, previously untreated patients with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the rectum who had undergone curative resection were randomized to treatment with combination radiation therapy and fluorouracil (5-FU) followed by either 12 months of 5-FU and MeCCNU or 6 months of escalating 5-FU. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March 1981 and November 1985, 210 patients were randomized by Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG) investigators. Subsequent to randomization, 11 (5%) patients (six treated with 5-FU and MeCCNU; five with escalating 5-FU) were found to be ineligible and are excluded from survival analyses. RESULTS: About half the patients on each of the two treatment arms experienced at least one episode of severe or worse toxicity, and there was one treatment-related death on each arm. No episodes of leukemia have been reported. Median follow-up time for surviving patients is 5.8 years, and 3-year follow-up is available for all but five surviving patients. Recurrent disease has been reported in 54% (51 of 95) of 5-FU- and MeCCNU-treated patients compared with 43% (45 of 104) of escalating 5-FU-treated patients. Probability of 3-year disease-free survival for the two treatment cohorts is 54% and 68%, respectively. Ninety-one deaths have occurred: 46% (44 of 95) of 5-FU- and MeCCNU-treated patients and 45% (47 of 104) of escalating 5-FU-treated patients. Three-year postsurgery survival probabilities are 66% and 75%. CONCLUSION: Substantial differences in survival or recurrence results between the two study arms are unlikely to be observed. We conclude that MeCCNU is not an essential component of effective postoperative combined modality treatment of adjuvant rectal cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="292"><COL><DATA> The objectives of this randomized trial are to define the maximum tolerated dose of radiation therapy, at curative dose levels, that can be delivered following WR-2721, and to observe the anti-tumor effects and normal tissue responses. One hundred patients with inoperable, unresectable, or recurrent rectal cancer were stratified and randomized to radiation only, or WR-2721 and radiation. The entire pelvis is treated with 4 portals 4 times a week to a total of 4500 cGy (first level dose) in 5 weeks. WR-2721, 340 mg/m2 was given 15 minutes before radiation to the combination group. Subsequently, both groups received a conedown of 720 cGy in 4 days to 144(2) cm portals APPA, and if originally inoperable or unresectable 720 cGy in four days to second conedown of 64(2) cm. Patients were observed from 3 to 18 months (median = 12 months). No significant hypotension or hematologic toxicity occurred in the WR-2721 treated group. Mild to moderate emesis occurred in 80% of the courses. (No antiemetics were used.) Moderate or severe acute toxicities to normal tissues were observed less frequently in the WR-2721 arm. No moderate or severe late toxicities to the skin, mucous membrane, urinary bladder or intestine was observed in the WR-2721 group, however, 5 patients treated with radiation alone experienced moderate or severe late toxicity to these organs.

The RT only group received the same treatment schedule. After this, both groups received a conedown of 720 cGy in 4 fractions. Inoperable and unresectable cases received a second conedown of 720 cGy. No moderate or severe pelvic normal tissue late effects were seen in the 34 evaluable patients in the combination group. However, in the RT only group, 5 of 37 evaluable patients exhibited late effects of moderate or severe degree. This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.03). There was no evidence of tumor protection by WR-2721. Sixteen percent of patients randomized to the WR + RT group had a complete response compared with 10% in the RT only group.

A partial remission (PR) was obtained in 1/30 patients (3%) treated with 5-FU and in 9/34 patients (26%) treated with 5-FU + FA (P = 0.028). The objective response was accompanied by an improvement in subjective status and general conditions. The median duration of PR in 5-FU + FA arm was 10 months (range: 6-17). The median time to progression was 5 and 6 months in patients treated with 5FU and 5FU + FA, respectively (not a statistically significant difference). There were no cases of grade 4 toxicity. A higher, but not statistically significant, incidence and intensity of diarrhoea was observed in the 5-FU + FA arm. However, 14 patients on 5-FU + FA as opposed to 3 on 5-FU had to stop the treatment temporarily because of side-effects (P = 0.011). Median survival was higher with 5-FU + FA treatment (10 vs 7 months), but the difference is not statistically significant. This study confirms that the addition of an intermediate dose of FA enhances the cytotoxicity of 5-FU. Although its clinical advantage was limited, this weekly 5-FU + FA regimen appears useful in the treatment of advanced colo-rectal cancer on a outpatient basis</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="305"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: The combination of pelvic radiotherapy and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy is associated with an increase in acute gastrointestinal toxicity during rectal adjuvant therapy, most notably an increased incidence of diarrhea. Previous randomized, prospective studies have limited their analysis to presenting rates of severe and life-threatening diarrhea (Grade 3 or greater), and few data are available detailing the extent of mild to moderate diarrhea. To provide baseline data for future studies, we conducted a detailed analysis of diarrhea from a prior clinical trial of adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In a multiinstitutional clinical trial, 204 eligible patients with rectal carcinoma that either was deeply invasive (T3-T4) or involved regional lymph nodes were randomized to receive either postoperative pelvic radiotherapy alone (45 to 50.4 Gy) or pelvic radiotherapy and bolus 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Toxicity was assessed prospectively. RESULTS: For the 99 eligible patients who received pelvic radiotherapy alone, rates of Grades 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 diarrhea during treatment were 59, 20, 17, 4, and 0%, respectively. For the 96 eligible patients who received radiotherapy and 5-fluorouracil, the overall rates of grades 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 diarrhea were 21, 34, 23, 20, and 2%, respectively. The increased rates of diarrhea during adjuvant rectal therapy were manifested across all toxicity levels for patients receiving chemotherapy and pelvic radiotherapy. Of primary clinical importance is the substantial increase in severe or life-threatening diarrhea (Grade 3 or more) (22 vs. 4%,p = 0.001) Additionally, increased rates of any diarrhea and also severe or life-threatening diarrhea were observed in patients who had a low anterior resection compared with those who had an abdominoperineal resection (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.006, respectively). CONCLUSION: These results will be of value as a baseline for investigators who want to use treatment toxicity as an end point in cancer control or cancer therapy trials utilizing similar treatment techniques. Patients receiving 5-fluorouracil and pelvic radiotherapy compared with patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy alone and patients with a prior history of a low anterior resection compared with patients who had a prior history of an abdominoperineal resection experienced increased rates of Grades 1 through 4 acute treatment-related diarrhea, and the most important increase occurred as Grade 3 toxicity</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="351"><COL><DATA> A prospective, multicentre, randomized trial was carried out in 19 hospitals in order to compare the efficacy of amoxycillin-clavulanic acid with cefotetan as antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. Since the main purpose of the study was to demonstrate equivalence between the two regimens, the protocol planned the inclusion of 200 patients. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive either amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (2.2 g) or cefotetan (2 g) in a single infusion on the induction of anaesthesia. Failure of prophylaxis was defined as occurrence of infection of intestinal origin, either minor (wound cellulitis) or major (abscess, peritonitis, septicaemia) within the 30-day postoperative period. Among 221 randomized patients, 208 (105 amoxycillin-clavulanic acid, 103 cefotetan) aged 66 +/- 12 years (mean +/- SD) were evaluated while 13 were withdrawn. Colorectal cancer was the indication for surgery in 73% of cases. Eleven (10 +/- 6%, 95% confidence interval) and 13 (13 +/- 7%) failures were observed in the amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and cefotetan groups (P = 0.63 chi-square test) respectively. Most infections occurred before the 10th postoperative day (8% failures at this time, estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method). The results of the trial demonstrate that amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and cefotetan have similar efficacy when used for prophylaxis of infection after elective colorectal surgery</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="355"><COL><DATA> One hundred sixty consecutive patients with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer (advanced disease) without prior chemotherapy were entered in a randomized trial comparing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 1,000 mg/m2 intravenously per day for 5 consecutive days in continuous infusion versus cisplatin (CP) 100 mg/m2 on day 1 plus 5-FU as described on days 2 to 6. In both arms, treatment was recycled every 4 weeks. Both groups were well balanced for age, sex, colon or rectal origin, median time between diagnosis to advanced disease, performance status at entry, and visceral involvement. The overall response rate in the combination and in the single arm were 18 and 23%, respectively. There were no differences in time to progression (a median of 17.8 and 14.9 weeks for CP-5-FU and 5-FU, respectively) and in overall survival (a median of 71.2 and 59.6 weeks, respectively).

Three regimens were compared: a combination of 2 g ceftriaxone and 1 g metronidazole; a single dose of 2 g ceftriaxone; or 1 g cefazolin and 1 g metronidazole, as antibacterial prophylaxis in colorectal surgery. Fifty patients were excluded from analysis. The overall incidence of wound sepsis was 7.9% (22 patients). There was no statistical difference in the incidence of wound infections between the three groups. The presence of drains and the non-performance of a bowel anastomosis at the time of surgery predisposed patients to wound infection. Staphylococcus aureus or Staphylococcus epidermidis were the cause of wound infection in 16 cases. Patients in the cefazolin and metronidazole group had a significantly higher number of postoperative urinary tract and respiratory tract infections than the other two groups combined (P less than 0.01).

In 144 fully evaluable patients who were studied for 5 years, allopurinol and DMSO incurred a significant (p less than 0.01) survival advantage over the whole period of study. The similarity in efficacy between allopurinol and DMSO and the fact that the only action they share is scavenging oxyradicals, suggest that these radicals are implicated in the detrimental effects of malignancy and that removing them provides a survival advantage in patients bearing colonic carcinoma</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="418"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND. The results of a randomized, multicenter clinical trial with perioperative short-term antibiotic plus intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG + A) versus antibiotic alone (A) for prevention of postoperative infections in patients at risk for sepsis undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer are presented. METHODS. The patients at risk for sepsis were selected by an original multiparametric test based on delayed-hypersensitivity skin testing and serum protein electrophoretic subfractions. This screening had shown 76% positive predictability in a previous validation assessment. Eighty patients at risk for sepsis were selected prospectively from 210 patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer; 43 patients were randomly assigned to the IVIG + A group and 37 to the A group. IVIG was administered on the day before operation, on the first and fifth postoperative days. RESULTS. There was a clear-cut reduction of postoperative infections in the IVIG + A group: 21 infections in 20 patients versus 37 infections in 29 patients in the A group (p less than 0.004). With regard to serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G monitoring, basal IgG levels were significantly lower in patients given IVIG + A who had postsurgical infections (p less than 0.005) compared with patients with a regular outcome, whereas the same was not true in the A group of patients.

Twenty-one of these patients received maintenance MeCCNU + 5-FU chemotherapy following radiation. Entry was terminated when late treatment reactions were seen in the precursor pilot study. Twenty-four of the patients have died; the estimated median survival is 17 months in each of the treatment arms. Performance status was the only significant prognostic factor for survival. The rate of severe, acute reactions during the radiation treatment period was higher for the continuous-course than for the split-course regimen (69 vs. 21%, p = .01). The rates of severe late treatment reactions, 23% (7 of 30), and severe chemotherapy toxicity, 48%, were similar for the two treatment programs. Late treatment reactions, primarily bowel complications, were seen from 3 to 23 months after radiation in 3 patients treated with continuous course, and 4 patients treated with split course. Ten of 21 patients (48%) who received maintenance chemotherapy had severe or worse toxicity. Toxicity was seen for 6 of 12 continuous-course, and 4 of 9 split-course patients.

Polyps &gt; 9 mm were resected, the others were left to be measured annually before resection after 3 years. The protocol (performed in all of the patients) included registration of demographic data, family and personal history, measurement of polyps, collection of blood specimens, stools and biopsy samples. Registration of nutritional status, diet history and 5-day prospective food consumption, was performed in 108 patients. The patient compliance was registered every third month by the hospital pharmacist, with concomitant delivery of new boxes of capsules. Additionally, stool collections were performed from all of the patients for the measurement of faecal calcium, bile salts and fat. Inclusion rate of 37, 41 and 38 patients in each of the three 6-month periods was uniform. The group with the largest polyps measuring 5-9 mm comprised 44% of the material.

No improvement was observed in frequency of symptomatic palliation, interval to progression, or survival among patients receiving MER. Furthermore, there was no evidence of enhanced immunological status in patients receiving MER as compared to those receiving radiation alone. Although temporary pain relief was seen in 94% of patients with pretreatment pelvic or perineal pain, 37 patients (84%) have experienced subsequent progressive malignant disease. Regional recurrences within the radiotherapy port were observed in 28 of 31 patients who were evaluable for analysis of pattern of sites of initial progression. Eleven of the 28 patients with local failure also had distant metastasis at the time of tumor progression.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-six patients were assigned randomly to HAI of floxuridine (5 fluoro-2&apos;deoxyuridine [FUDR]) 0.3 mg/kg/d for 14 days every 4 weeks or to the control group; this latter group, depending on the investigator&apos;s choice, was either under observation or received systemic fluorouracil (5-FU). The same regimen of systemic 5-FU also was administered to the HAI group in the event of extrahepatic progression. No crossover from the control group to the HAI group was permitted. The mean duration of follow-up was 54 months (range, 31 to 72), and 163 patients were analyzed. RESULTS: A significant improvement was observed in the survival rate for the 81 patients assigned to HAI group (P less than .02) with a 1-year survival rate of 64% versus 44% in the control group (82 patients). The 2-year survival rate was 23% versus 13%. The median survival was 15 months versus 11 months for the HAI group and the control group, respectively. Survival was better for patients with a less than 30% liver involvement, and for those treated in more specialized centers. The hepatotoxic effects of HAI were observed in 47 patients (chemical hepatitis [n = 28], and biliary sclerosis [n = 19]). The 1-year rate of sclerosing cholangitis was equal to 25%. Gastrointestinal toxicity was infrequent and consisted of gastritis or diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with HAI of FUDR improves the survival of patients with liver metastases over colorectal carcinoma. However, the methods that are used to diminish the toxicity of HAI and efficient systemic chemotherapy, such as a combination of 5-FU and leucovorin, are required to prevent extrahepatic metastases</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="519"><COL><DATA> To decrease the toxicity of hepatic arterial fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR) administered through an Infusaid pump (Shiley Infusaid, Inc., Norwood, MA), 50 patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer were selected randomly to receive FUDR, 0.3 mg/kg/d, for 14 of 28 days, with or without a total dose of 20 mg of hepatic arterial dexamethasone for 14 of 28 days. Patients were stratified according to the percentage of liver involvement by tumor and the perfusion pattern on macroaggrated albumin perfusion scan (MAA) scan. There was a trend toward decreased frequency of bilirubin levels in the group receiving dexamethasone plus FUDR versus the group receiving FUDR alone (9% and 30%, respectively, had a 200% or greater increase from baseline; P = 0.07). Patients in the group treated with dexamethasone and FUDR received higher doses of FUDR in the second, third, fifth, and sixth months than those receiving FUDR alone; however, this was statistically significant only in the fifth month (percentages of planned dose received: 42% and 19%, respectively; P = 0.05), and there was no overall difference for the total 6-month period. The complete and partial response rates were increased in patients receiving dexamethasone and FUDR versus FUDR alone (8% and 63% versus 4% and 36%, respectively; P = 0.03), and there was a trend toward increased survival with the addition of dexamethasone (median, 23 months and 15 months, respectively; P = 0.06). In conclusion, the use of hepatic arterial dexamethasone is associated with an increased response rate and a trend toward increased survival and decreased bilirubin levels.

Typical complications, such as pancreatic fistula, abscess, and subsequent sepsis, are chiefly associated with exocrine pancreatic secretion. In order to clarify whether the perioperative inhibition of exocrine pancreatic secretion prevents complications, we assessed the efficacy of octreotide, a long-acting somatostatin analogue. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial in 246 patients undergoing major elective pancreatic surgery. Patients were stratified into a high-risk stratum (limited to patients with pancreatic and periampullary tumors) or low-risk stratum (patients with chronic pancreatitis). Patients received octreotide (3 x 100 micrograms) or placebo subcutaneously for 7 days perioperatively. Eleven complications were defined: death, leakage of anastomosis, pancreatic fistula, abscess, fluid collection, shock, sepsis, bleeding, pulmonary insufficiency, renal insufficiency, and postoperative pancreatitis. Two hundred patients underwent pancreatic head resection, 31 patients underwent left resection, and 15 patients had other procedures. The overall mortality rate within 90 days was 4.5%, with 3.2% in the octreotide group and 5.8% in the placebo group. The complication rate was 32% in the patients receiving octreotide (40 of 125 patients) and 55% in patients receiving placebo (67 of 121 patients) (p less than 0.005). In the patients in the high-risk stratum, complications were observed in 26 of the 68 (38%) patients treated with octreotide and in 46 of 71 (65%) patients given placebo (p less than 0.01). Whereas in patients in the low-risk stratum, the complication rate was 25% (14 of 57 patients) in those treated with octreotide and 42% (21 of 50 patients) in patients given placebo (p = NS).

Patients were randomized to one of four treatment arms (3.0 Gy x 10 fractions with or without 1 g/m2 of Misonidazole [total 10 g/m2] versus 5.0 Gy x 6 fractions with or without 2 g/m2 of Misonidazole) [total 12 g/m2]. Among the 779 analyzable cases, 63% had a lung primary and 12% had breast. Of the histologic types, 43% were adenocarcinoma and 24% were squamous cell. Seventy-eight percent had a Karnofsky of greater than 70. Of the 779 cases, 773 are dead (99%). Median survival is 3.9 months, with 60% alive at 3 months, 35% at 6 months, and 15% at 1 year.

Favorable prognostic factors were assessed (age less than 60, Karnofsky of 70-100, controlled primary and brain metastasis only) in each treatment arm and no difference was found. Brain metastasis was cause of death in 1/3, and 19-33% of patients were retreated. Because up to 1/3 of the patients in this study died secondary to uncontrolled brain metastasis, improvement in local control remains an important goal.

Tamoxifen, a synthetic antiestrogen, increases disease-free and overall survival when used as adjuvant therapy for primary breast cancer. Because it is given for long periods, it is important to know whether tamoxifen affects the skeleton, particularly since it is used extensively in postmenopausal women who are at risk for osteoporosis. Using photon absorptiometry, we studied the effects of tamoxifen on the bone mineral density of the lumbar spine and radius and on biochemical measures of bone metabolism in 140 postmenopausal women with axillary-node-negative breast cancer, in a two-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. RESULTS. In the women given tamoxifen, the mean bone mineral density of the lumbar spine increased by 0.61 percent per year, whereas in those given placebo it decreased by 1.00 percent per year (P less than 0.001). Radial bone mineral density decreased to the same extent in both groups. In a subgroup randomly selected from each group, serum osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase concentrations decreased significantly in women given tamoxifen (P less than 0.001 for each variable), whereas serum parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations did not change significantly in either group. CONCLUSIONS. In postmenopausal women, treatment with tamoxifen is associated with preservation of the bone mineral density of the lumbar spine.

Toxic effects manifested less frequently in group A than in group B, and the decrease in the platelet count in the peripheral blood was significantly lower in group A than in group B.

Thirty-two cirrhotic patients with unresectable or otherwise untreatable hepatocellular carcinoma were allocated to receive either tamoxifen (30 mg/day) or no treatment. The patients in the two groups were matched for age, male/female ratio, Child-Pugh class, approximate tumor volume (US and CT scan), and etiology of the underlying cirrhosis. Survival of the tamoxifen-treated patients (life-table, Wilcoxon-Breslow) was significantly prolonged (P = 0.0038), with 35% (vs 0%) survival at 12 months. No difference was observed between males and females or between alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhosis. In 40% of tamoxifen-treated patients, the levels of alpha-fetoprotein declined. In conclusion, the antiestrogen tamoxifen appears to be effective in the palliative treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. An initial decline in alpha-fetoprotein levels may represent an early favorable prognostic sign</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="728"><COL><DATA> Between October, 1986, and March, 1990, 20 consecutive untreated and noncirrhotic patients with measurable and histologically and/or cytologically confirmed unresectable primary liver cancer were randomly assigned to intravenous (10 patients) or intra-arterial (10 patients) therapy. Patients were treated every 4 weeks with a combination chemotherapy regimen containing 4&apos; epidoxorubicin and 5-fluorouracil. A 3-min bolus injection of 4&apos; epidoxorubicin was followed by 5-fluorouracil given in a 90-min infusion. The dose of 4&apos; epidoxorubicin was escalated: the starting dose was 40 mg/m2, the second dose was 50 mg/m2, and thereafter 60 mg/m2 during subsequent cycles. The dose of 5-fluorouracil was always 800 mg/m2. Objective response rates (20%) were similar in both treatments; two patients had partial responses in the intra-arterially treated group and one complete and one partial response were recorded in the intravenously treated group. The median survival time was 15.2 months for the patients treated intra-arterially and 13.8 months for the patients treated intravenously. Toxicity was mainly mild in both groups with less hematopoietic toxicity in the I.A.-treated group. 4&apos; epidoxorubicin combined with 5-fluorouracil given intra-arterially is not superior to the intravenous therapy, but it may diminish systemic toxicity</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="730"><COL><DATA> A previously reported Phase I/II multimodality program for non-resectable hepatocellular cancer began with external beam-radiation and chemotherapy, followed by administration of 131I antiferritin-specific radioimmunoglobulin and led to a 48% remission (7% complete remission and 41% partial remission). Survival and response depended on alpha fetoprotein status. AFP+ patients had a median survival of 5 months; AFP- patients had a median survival of 10.5 months. No acute effects occurred relative to treatment with radiolabeled antibody. A randomized prospective study was designed to compare full dose chemotherapy consisting of 60 mg/m2, doxorubicin and 500 mg/m2 of 5-fluorouracil administered every 3 weeks, to 131I antiferritin administration every 8 weeks and allowed for crossover treatment if tumor progression occurred. Overall, radiolabeled antibody administration and full dose chemotherapy led to equivalent partial remission rates (22-30% vs 23-25%) and survival rates compared to chemotherapy (6 month median; AFP+ 5 months; AFP- 10 months). The most important new observations were the response in AFP- patients who, following chemotherapy failure, achieved remission using 131I radiolabeled antibody (7/11) and a subset of patients (7%) who were treated with radiolabeled antibody and converted from non-resectable to resectable status followed by surgical excision</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="838"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND. Endocrine factors may affect the clinical course of malignant melanoma and the response to the treatment of this disease. The presence of estrogen receptors in melanomas has been suggested, and occasional responses to antiestrogen therapy have been reported. METHODS AND RESULTS. We randomly assigned 117 patients with metastatic malignant melanoma to treatment with dacarbazine alone or dacarbazine in combination with tamoxifen. The overall rate of response, measured objectively, was higher (28 percent vs. 12 percent, P = 0.03) and survival was longer (median, 48 vs. 29 weeks, P = 0.02) among the patients who received dacarbazine plus tamoxifen than among those who received dacarbazine alone. Among women, both the response rate (38 percent vs. 10 percent, P = 0.04) and the median survival (69 vs. 30 weeks, P = 0.008) were better with dacarbazine plus tamoxifen than with dacarbazine alone, whereas among men the differences were smaller and not statistically significant. Among the patients given dacarbazine alone, there were no significant differences between women and men in response rate (10 percent vs. 13 percent) or survival (30 vs. 27 weeks), whereas among those given dacarbazine plus tamoxifen, women had better outcomes, as indicated by both response rate (38 percent vs. 19 percent, P = 0.15) and survival (69 vs. 31 weeks, P = 0.02). When we analyzed the Quetelet body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) as an indirect indicator of the levels of endogenous estrogens in postmenopausal women and in men, survival was not affected by the body-mass index in the group given dacarbazine alone, whereas in the group given dacarbazine plus tamoxifen, survival was longer among patients whose Quetelet index was above the median value than among those with a Quetelet index lower than the median value (60 vs. 26 weeks, P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. In the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma, dacarbazine plus tamoxifen is more effective than dacarbazine alone, as indicated by both the response rate and the median survival; the difference in efficacy is mainly among women.</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="839"><COL><DATA> Laboratory data suggest a synergistic interaction between carmustine (BCNU) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in melanoma.

In this randomised phase II trial, the rate of response to BCNU alone was 20% [95% confidence interval (CI), 2%-38%], and this was not improved by the addition of TNF (response rate, 10.5%; 95% CI, 1.3%-33%).

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From January 1978 to May 1989, a prospective randomized trial on preoperative radiotherapy (R+S) vs. surgery alone (S) for AGC was carried out in 370 patients. Patients were randomized into a combined group (R+S, 171 patients) or a surgery alone group (S, 199 patients) by the envelope method. 8-MV photon or telecobalt was used for the preoperative radiation therapy, using anterior-posterior opposing parallel fields to deliver 40 Gy to the cardia, lower segment of the esophagus, fundus, lesser curvature, and hepatogastric ligament. Surgery was performed after 2 to 4 weeks rest. RESULTS: The 5- and 10-year survival rates of the R+S Group and the S Alone Group were 30.10% and 19.75%, 20.26% and 13.30%, respectively. The survival curves of these two groups diverged right from the beginning after the operation over the ninth year. Statistics by Kaplan-Meier log rank test proves that the difference is significant (chi2 = 6.74, p = 0.0094). The immediate results were: resection rate 89.5% and 79.4% (p &lt; 0.01); pathologic stage after resection T2 12.9% and 4.5% (p &lt; 0.01), T4 40.3% and 51.3% (p &lt; 0.05), lymph node metastasis rates 64.3% and 84.9% (p &lt; 0.001); operative mortality rates 0.6% and 2.5%; intrathoracic leak rates 1.8% and 4.0%, respectively. The causes of failure were: local uncontrol and recurrence 38.6% vs. 51.7% (p &lt; 0.025), regional lymph node metastasis 38.6% vs. 54.6% (p &lt; 0.005), distant metastasis 24.3% vs. 24.7%.

About two thirds (76.6%) were advanced gastric cancer (stages III and IV). The 5-year survival rate of operated stage III gastric cancer was only 30.6%, with frequent recurrence. Conversely, cell-mediated immunities of advanced gastric cancer patients were significantly decreased. Therefore, to improve the cure rate and to prevent or delay recurrence, curative surgery with confirmation of free resection margins and systematic lymph node dissection of perigastric vessels were performed and followed by early postoperative immunotherapy and chemotherapy (immunochemosurgery) in stage III patients. To evaluate the effect of immunochemosurgery, two randomized trials were studied in 1976 and 1981. In first trial, 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C, and cytosine arabinoside for chemotherapy and OK 432 for immunotherapy were used. The 5-year survival rates for surgery alone (n = 64) and immunochemosurgery (n = 73) were 23.4% and 44.6%, respectively, a significant difference. In the second trial, there were three groups: group I, immunochemosurgery (n = 159); group II, surgery and chemotherapy (n = 77); and group III, surgery alone (n = 94). 5-Fluorouracil and mitomycin C for chemotherapy and OK-432 for immunotherapy were administered for 2 years. The 5-year survival rate of group I was 45.3%, significantly higher than the 29.8% of group II and than the 24.4% of group III. The postoperative 1-chloro-2.4-dinitrobenzene test, T-lymphocyte percentage, phytohemagglutinin- and con-A-stimulated lymphoblastogenesis and the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity test showed more favorable values in the immunochemosurgery group.

Patients randomised to group A received therapy that is used widely to treat patients with gastric cancer in Japan; mitomycin C (MMC), OK-432, UFT and PSK. Patients randomised to group B received the same drugs given to group A plus 5-FU bolus injections for 5 days, beginning on postoperative day 2. There were no differences in prognostic factors and doses of the drugs prescribed, except for 5-FU. There was no difference in the toxicity rate between the groups.

Here we report a prospective, stratified, random-assignment comparison of the two combinations in previously untreated patients with advanced gastric cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty patients were entered onto the trial, 30 receiving EAP and 30 FAMTX. All patients had measurable or assessable tumor masses. Patient entry was stopped at the point when significant toxicity differences were seen at interim analysis. RESULTS: Response rates were similar between the two arms (FAMTX, 33% [95% confidence interval (CI), 16% to 50%]; EAP, 20% [95% Cl, 6% to 34%]). Three FAMTX and no EAP patients had complete remissions. The median survival for the two arms were similar (EAP, 6.1 months; FAMTX, 7.3 months). At 1 year, 7% of EAP and 17% of FAMTX patients were alive. EAP caused significantly more myelosuppression (leukopenia, P = .002; anemia, P = .03; thrombocytopenia, P = .0001) than did FAMTX. EAP also resulted in significantly longer hospitalizations per study month (8 v 5 days). Four EAP patients died of lethal toxicity, whereas no FAMTX patients died of treatment-related causes (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: FAMTX is at least as active as EAP and is significantly less toxic. Although both regimens remain investigational, the toxicities of FAMTX are more manageable. Further studies involving FAMTX in both the adjuvant and advanced disease setting are underway</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1023"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Between 1980 and 1984, 26 patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head were enrolled in a National Cancer Institute protocol evaluating intraoperative radiotherapy vs. standard therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: After complete excision of their lesions, patients were observed (Stage I), or randomized to intraoperative radiotherapy vs. external beam radiotherapy (Stages II-IV). The intraoperative dose was 20 Gy in a single fraction using 9-20 MeV electrons. The external beam radiotherapy schema involved daily 150-180 cGy fractions to 45-55 Gy in 5-6 weeks. Chemotherapy was not used for primary disease but was administered off protocol for recurrent disease. Median potential followup for the trial was &gt; 9 years, with a median patient survival of 18 months. Perioperative mortality was 27% (7 patients). Of the remaining 19 patients, one remains alive and without evidence of disease 9 years post-therapy. Twelve patients underwent autopsy and 2 required antemortem laparotomy; histopathologic evidence of disease recurrence was analyzed. RESULTS: Of 15 patients evaluable for intra-abdominal control, 7 (47%) suffered local recurrences and 7 (47%) failed regionally, with 5 patients (35%) failing in both areas. Five patients (35%) developed peritoneal seeding. Of 13 patients evaluable for systemic disease, 8 (62%) suffered distant failure. There were no differences in outcome between intraoperative or external beam radiotherapy or observation in this subset of patients. CONCLUSION: This report is among the most rigorous descriptions of patterns of failure after resection of pancreatic cancer. It appears clear that advances in local control of this disease are unlikely to translate into increased survival in the absence of improved systemic therapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1024"><COL><DATA> Experimental studies have shown a significant inhibition of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas by gonadoliberin (luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone [LH-RH]) and somatostatin. The aim of this prospective randomized study was to compare the potential value of somatostatin (250 micrograms every 8 hours), LH-RH (3.75 mg monthly), or combined, to a control group. One hundred sixty-three patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who did not undergo resection for cure were divided into 4 groups that did not differ in terms of clinical, biologic, or pathologic data. The mean survival times were 6 months in the LH-RH plus somatostatin group, 5.5 months in the LH-RH group, 4.3 months in the control group, and 3.8 months in the somatostatin group. However, the life-table analyses for all randomized patients, and separately according to sex, the lymph node extension, and metastatic spread were not different between groups. Improvement of patient status was observed in 20% of the patients receiving hormone therapy without any difference noted between the treatment regimens. These disappointing results may be explained by the degree of extension of pancreatic carcinoma in the patients studied. The results suggest that different hormone therapy regimens might be considered according to the age and the sex of patients, as well as to the presence or absence of hormone receptors</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1074"><COL><DATA> Attempts to prevent peritoneal carcinomatosis after surgery for gastric cancer by intraperitoneal administration of anticancer drugs have not been successful, largely because the drugs are not retained in the peritoneal cavity. We have assessed the prophylactic efficacy of a delayed-release preparation--mitomycin adsorbed onto activated charcoal (M-CH). 50 patients with gastric cancer and serosal infiltration were randomly assigned intraperitoneal treatment with M-CH (50 mg mitomycin intraoperatively) or no anticancer prophylaxis (control). Survival rates for the 3 years of follow-up were significantly higher among the 24 M-CH recipients (1 was lost to follow-up) than among the 25 controls (p less than 0.01). There were significant differences in survival between the groups at 1.5 years after randomisation (difference 34.6% [95% confidence interval 8.5-60.8%]; p less than 0.01) and at 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 years (41.7% [14.2-69.1%]; p less than 0.005). The concentration of mitomycin was significantly higher in peritoneal exudate than in plasma for 24 h after drug administration. Side-effects were slight and well tolerated. Thus, peroperative intraperitoneal treatment with M-CH seems to improve survival after gastrectomy for gastric cancer, presumably by a prophylactic effect on peritoneal recurrence</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1130"><COL><DATA> Seventy-one patients with Stage Ib-IIa cervical cancer treated by radical hysterectomy and found to have pelvic lymph node metastases were entered on a randomized trial comparing standard pelvic radiotherapy versus three cycles of combination chemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin followed by pelvic radiotherapy.

In 12 patients, the first evidence of relapse was in the pelvis, in 11 patients the first relapse was evident at a distant site, and in 1 patient the local recurrence and distant metastases were documented simultaneously. No difference in disease-free or overall survival has emerged between the two treatment groups. Relapse was more common in patients with non-squamous tumors (44%) and in those with metastases in several pelvic lymph nodes.

Checked data were available for 75,000 women (about 90% of those ever randomised), of whom 32% had died and another 10% had experienced recurrence. The parts now reviewed include 30,000 women in tamoxifen trials, 3000 in ovarian ablation trials, 11,000 in polychemotherapy trials, 15,000 in other chemotherapy comparisons, and 6000 in immunotherapy trials. Highly significant reductions in the annual rates both of recurrence and of death are produced by tamoxifen (25% SD 2 recurrence and 17% SD 2 mortality: 2p less than 0.00001), by ablation below age 50 (26% SD 6 recurrence and 25% SD 7 mortality: 2p = 0.0004), and by polychemotherapy (28% SD 3 recurrence and 16% SD 3 mortality: 2p less than 0.00001), but not by ablation at older ages or by immunotherapy. (Tamoxifen also reduced the risk of development of contralateral breast cancer by 39% SD 9: 1p less than 0.00001). For tamoxifen and for polychemotherapy the avoidance of recurrence is chiefly during years 0-4 (this difference being maintained but not increased afterwards), but the avoidance of mortality is highly significant both during and after years 0-4, so the cumulative differences in survival produced by these relatively brief treatments (median: 2 years tamoxifen, 1 year polychemotherapy) are larger at 10 than at 5 years. There is little information beyond year 10 (except for ovarian ablation, which produces separately significant mortality reductions both during and after years 0-9). Both direct and indirect randomised comparisons show long-term polychemotherapy (eg, 12 months) to be no better than shorter (eg, 6 months) regimens, but do show polychemotherapy to be significantly better than single-agent chemotherapy. Indirect randomised comparisons do not reveal significant differences between different forms of polychemotherapy, or differences between different tamoxifen doses, but do show that long-term tamoxifen (eg, 2 years, or even 5 years) is significantly more effective than shorter tamoxifen regimens. In old age (70+) tamoxifen is of demonstrated efficacy, but chemotherapy has not been evaluated. Between ages 50 and 69 direct comparisons show that chemotherapy plus tamoxifen is better (1p less than 0.00001) than chemotherapy alone both for recurrence and for mortality, and better (1p less than 0.00001) than tamoxifen alone for recurrence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="6"><COL><DATA> Twenty-four patients with familial adenomatous polyposis who had previously undergone prophylactic colectomy and had advanced duodenal polyposis were entered into a randomized trial to assess the effect of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac on duodenal and rectal polyps.

Mucosal cell proliferation was measured by in vitro incorporation of 5-bromo-2&apos;-deoxyuridine.

However, the control of nausea and vomiting induced by oral CMF is a rarely examined problem. Therefore we felt a randomized, placebo controlled study justified in order to improve currently available antiemetic therapy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a randomised double-blind trial ondansetron given orally, 8 mg three times a day for 15 days, was compared with placebo in 82 breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy with CMF (cyclophosphamide 100 mg/m2 orally days 1-14, methotrexate 40 mg/m2 i.v. days 1 and 8 and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 i.v. days 1 and 8). The patients recorded nausea and the number of vomits and retches daily on diary cards. Forty-two patients received ondansetron and 40 received placebo. RESULTS: Significantly more patients who received ondansetron experienced neither vomiting nor retching (emesis) compared to those receiving placebo over a 15 day treatment period (60% vs. 35%, p = 0.027). The difference, with 95% confidence limits, was estimated at 25 (4.45%). Furthermore, there was a trend in favour of ondansetron in the control of nausea. Ondansetron was well tolerated, with 25 patients (59%) reporting at least 1 adverse event compared to 18 patients (45%) receiving placebo (p = 0.191). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that ondansetron given orally for 15 days is safe and effective in the control of emesis induced by CMF.

Both groups also received fluorouracil (5 FU) and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of each course. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference in response rate was observed (69% in group A v 41% in group B, P &lt; .001) for both locally advanced (LA) and recurrent metastatic (RM) disease. Response duration (22 v 14 months, P &lt; .01) and time to progression (TTP; 19 v 8 months, P &lt; .02) were also significantly improved. Overall survival was similar in both groups. However, univariate and/or multivariate analyses showed a meaningful relationship between type of treatment allocated, dose-intensity (DI) of epirubicin, and response rate, as well as between TTP and survival. Ultimately, TTP and survival were also influenced by further treatment modalities, namely, hormonotherapy and chemotherapy.

MPA may be of advantage in this setting because of its activity in estrogen receptor ER-positive as well as ER-negative tumors and since it may protect against chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression and thus enable maintenance of the appropriate chemotherapeutic scheduling. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred eight evaluable patients with node-positive (N+) operable breast cancer (T1-3, N1) were entered in a multicenter randomized trial. Two hundred nine patients were randomized in the MPA- arm and 199 in the MPA+ arm. CAF chemotherapy was given as a short i.v. bolus infusion: cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, and 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 i.v. day 1, q 4 wks x 6. MPA was given intramuscularly (i.m.) 500 mg q d x 28 days, followed by 500 mg i.m. twice weekly during 5 months. RESULTS: The main side effects of MPA were weight gain with a mean of 5.5 kg as opposed to 1.8 kg in the control group (p = 0.01) and vaginal bleeding in 30/199 in the MPA+ group and 0 in the MPA- group. MPA ameliorated vomiting grade III, IV (45% vs. 28%, p &lt; 0.001), nausea grade III, IV (50% vs. 34%, p &lt; 0.001) and leucocyte nadir grade III, IV (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.003). Disease-free survival (DFS) after 5 years was 59% in the MPA+ and 49% in the MPA- group (p = 0.12). Patients &gt; or = 60 years benefitted most from MPA treatment, in particular if freedom from distant metastases was taken as the endpoint (p = 0.02). Overall survival (OS) was not significantly different between the two treatment groups (p = 0.18), but within subgroups analysed there was an advantage for MPA+ in patients &gt; or = 55 years (p = 0.002) and in pT1 patients (p = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS: High-dose MPA ameliorates CAF side effects and reduces the risk of metastatic disease, especially in elderly breast cancer patients</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="58"><COL><DATA> Thirty-eight patients with stage II breast cancer with four or more positive axillary lymph nodes were randomized to receive CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil, every 3 weeks) or CXF (cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone and 5-fluorouracil, every 3 weeks). Pretreatment characteristics were similar for both groups. The actuarial 5 year disease-free survival (DFS) was 36% for the CMF group and 23% for the CXF group. The actuarial 5 year survival was 60% for the CMF arm and 66% for the CXF arm. These differences were not statistically significant. Partial alopecia was observed in 42% of patients in the CMF arm and in 100% of those receiving CXF (p = 0.0002). No episodes of leucopenic fever were observed in patients receiving CMF, while they were present in 53% of patients treated with CXF (p = 0.0006). No stomatitis occurred in the CMF group, but it was observed in 90% of patients who received CXF (p &lt; 0.0001). Treatment with CXF had to be discontinued in two patients because of toxicity. In this small group of patients with poor prognosis, it seems that CXF at the doses given here is more toxic but not more effective than CMF, as represented by a similar DFS and survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="59"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: We report two randomized trials of adjuvant systemic therapy in 747 patients &lt; or = 65 years of age with histologically proven node-positive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were selected for the two trials on the basis of lymph node and hormone receptor status. The only stratification was based on the treating institution. In patients with a lower probability of recurrence (n = 276), a comparison between endocrine therapy (tamoxifen [Tam] 30 mg/d for 2 years) and chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil [CMF] intravenously [IV], six cycles every 4 weeks) was performed. In patients with a higher risk of recurrence (n = 471), a comparison between chemotherapy alone (doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide [AC] i.v., eight cycles every 3 weeks) and the same chemotherapy plus Tam was made. RESULTS: Overall, we found that CMF and Tam are equally effective in a subgroup of patients with a relatively good prognosis (low-risk patients). However, in the subset of women &lt; or = 49 years old, a significantly greater disease-free survival (DFS) rate (P = .01) and overall survival (OS) rate (P = .002) was observed following therapy with CMF compared with Tam. In patients &gt; or = 50 years old, the opposite was found, and Tam appeared to be superior to CMF (DFS, P = .003; OSm P = .5). These results must be interpreted cautiously, since a post-hoc stratification of patients by age (&lt; or = 49, &gt; or = 50) was performed, and significantly more younger, low-risk patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone and more older patients to receive Tam alone. Among patients with a relatively poor prognosis (high-risk patients), a combination of AC plus Tam was equivalent to AC and, when women were analyzed by age, this was found to be true of patients &lt; or = 49 years as well. However, the addition of Tam to AC in women age &gt; or 50 years resulted in a statistically significantly higher DFS (P = .01) and a trend toward better OS compared with women who received AC alone. CONCLUSION: Further trials are required to analyze the role of combined simultaneous or sequential chemoendocrine adjuvant treatment or each single therapy alone in defined risk-adapted subsets of node-negative and node-positive patients</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="124"><COL><DATA> In a multicenter randomized clinical trial 106 post-menopausal patients with progressive metastatic breast cancer were allocated to receive 500 mg or 1000 mg Aminoglutethimide (AG) per os daily. Cortisone Acetate (CA) replacement dose was 37.5 mg/day orally in both groups. In 91 fully evaluable patients, no statistically significant difference was observed between the two therapeutic regimens, neither in terms of overall response (28 vs 35%) and by site responses, nor in terms of median time to progression (10.5 vs 14.5 months) and median overall survival (20 vs. 22 months). The tolerability was satisfactory in both regimens. Although no statistically significant differences occurred, in the low dose regimen we observed fewer patients with side-effects (25% vs 6%) and induced grade 3 side-effects (4% vs 9%). Our results confirm that AG daily doses of 500 and 1000 mg associated with corticosteroids have a comparable effect.

Node-negative patients with a high 3H-Tdr Labelling Index (3H-Tdr-LI) were randomised to receive either no further treatment or combination chemotherapy consisting of fluorouracil, epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (FEC) for 6 cycles. The autoradiographic assay was performed in 307 of 317 patients (97%) and was evaluable in 291 of 317 patients (92%). A total of 176 patients with a high 3H-Tdr-LI entered the clinical randomised study: 91 in the FEC arm and 85 in the control arm. Patient groups were fairly well balanced regarding the most important clinical and pathological characteristics. In total, 530 FEC cycles have been administered with an actual dose intensity of 90%. Patients receiving FEC demonstrated leucopenia in 35% of cases, alopecia in 70%, and loss of menses in premenopausal patients in an age-dependent manner.

The two groups were well-matched for previous response to tamoxifen (TAM) therapy (AGT (35%) vs HC (32%)) and for relapse on adjuvant TAM. The mean age of the two groups was 69.2 years (AGT) and 63.2 years (HC). Liver metastases were present in 29% (AGT) and 33% (HC). The response rates were 11% (AGT) and 21% (HC). At 12 months the failure of treatment rate was 80% (AGT) and 70% (HC). Survival at 12 months was 50% for both groups. At 12 months 5/12 survivors were still on AGT and 8/12 on HC.

Duration of closed suction drainage, 72 h, and shoulder exercises, commencing on the first post-operative day, were standardized for both groups. Closed suction drainage was significantly less (P &lt; 0.05) in the group that had flaps sutured, 272 +/- 46 ml vs 393 +/- 39 ml. Also fewer patients in the flap sutured group developed seromas, 5 (25%) vs 17 (85%) chi 2 = 12.2 P &lt; 0.001. Three patients in the group that had conventional skin closure had breakdown of wound edges, two developing a prolonged serous discharge, while none occurred in the sutured group. A functional range of shoulder motion was attained at 6 months in 14 (70%) patients in the flap sutured group compared with nine (45%) in the conventional skin closure group (P = NS).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty-one women 65 to 84 years old were given 20 mg of tamoxifen or placebo daily for 2 years after stratification by estrogen receptor status, tumor size, and degree of lymph node involvement. Approximately 30% of patients were older than 70 years and 20% were older than 75 years. Eighty-five percent were estrogen receptor-positive. Median follow-up was 10 years. RESULTS: Among the 168 eligible patients, there have been 98 recurrences (59 placebo v 39 tamoxifen), with reduced distant and bone-only first sites in patients treated with tamoxifen. Median time to failure was 4.4 years for placebo versus 7.4 years for tamoxifen (log-rank P = .001). A similar number of new nonbreast cancers occurred in each arm (seven placebo v six tamoxifen), but a reduced number of opposite-breast cancers (five placebo v one tamoxifen) was noted. Overall, there were 102 deaths (57 placebo v 45 tamoxifen). Median survivals were 8.0 years with placebo and 8.5 years with tamoxifen (log-rank P = .063); 50% of the tamoxifen patients and 33% of the placebo patients are still alive. Sixty-one percent of the deaths were reported to have been caused by breast cancer recurrence, 4% by other cancers, and 22% by the sequelae of non-cancer-related illness, with equal distributions for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. There was no increase in the number of endometrial or other types of cancer, or thrombotic or orthopedic complications in this older group. CONCLUSION: Tamoxifen currently is the treatment of choice for elderly women with breast cancer. It extends the time to treatment failure by 3 years and reduces the number of recurrences, deaths, distant and bone-only first recurrences, and second breast cancers</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="178"><COL><DATA> After intubation for advanced, inoperable squamous carcinoma of the oesophagus, a prospectively controlled randomized trial was done to investigate the effect of radiotherapy (41 patients) or mono-chemotherapy (40 patients) or no further treatment (46 patients).

However, reconstruction in the posterior mediastinum was associated with significantly fewer days spent in the intensive therapy unit (9 versus 14), fewer cardiopulmonary complications (13 versus 25 per cent) and lower mortality (30-day mortality rate 2 versus 6 per cent; hospital mortality rate 4 versus 10 per cent).

After 54 one- and 53 two-layer procedures the rates of anastomotic leakage were the same (19 per cent). After a mean follow-up of 44 weeks, 13 of 51 patients (25 per cent) undergoing one-layer anastomosis and 28 of 50 (56 per cent) having the two-layer procedure complained of cervical dysphagia and required dilatation. The anastomotic strictures were fibrotic in 11 of 51 patients (22 per cent) undergoing one-layer anastomosis and in 24 of 50 (48 per cent) receiving the two-layer operation. Strictures were malignant in two and four patients (4 and 8 per cent) respectively. The lower incidence of fibrotic stricture following one-layer anastomosis was significant (P &lt; 0.01), but not that of malignant stricture. With comparable leakage rates, one-layer anastomosis is superior to the two-layer procedure because of the lower incidence of fibrotic stricture</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="182"><COL><DATA> A prospective randomized trial of 67 patients undergoing oesophagectomy by either a transhiatal approach or right-sided thoracotomy was conducted over a 40-month period. In 32 patients the approach was transhiatal and 35 had a thoracotomy; the groups were well matched before operation. There were two hospital deaths in patients having the transhiatal oesophagectomy and three in those undergoing thoracotomy. Blood transfusion, intensive care stay and overall time of hospitalization were not significantly different between the two groups. There was no difference in the postoperative morbidity rate and, in particular, the incidences of pulmonary complications were similar (19 per cent for transhiatal oesophagectomy, 20 per cent for thoracotomy) with anastomotic fistula in 6 and 9 per cent respectively. The median (range) operating time was significantly longer in patients having thoracotomy (6 (3.5-9.5) versus 4 (3-8) h). Long-term survival was unaffected by the type of operation performed or addition of preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Nodal status was a significant prognostic factor within but not between the two groups.

A prospective, randomized controlled study of radiotherapy after resection of esophageal carcinoma was carried out in 130 patients. Patients were stratified according to whether the resection was curative or palliative and were then randomized to receive postoperative radiotherapy or no additional treatment. Sixty patients underwent curative resection; 30 each were randomized into the radiotherapy group (CR + R) and the control group (CR). Seventy patients underwent palliative resection; 35 each were randomized into the radiotherapy group (PR + R) and the control group (PR). RESULTS. No complications occurred while the patients were undergoing radiotherapy treatment. On follow-up, complications in the intrathoracic stomach occurred in 24 patients (37%) who underwent radiotherapy compared with four patients (6%) in the control group (p &lt; 0.0001). Seventeen of these 24 patients in the radiotherapy group had gastric ulceration and there were five deaths as a result of bleeding. Local recurrence developed significantly less frequently in the PR + R group compared with the PR group (seven patients [20%] vs 16 patients [46%]; p = 0.04); no difference was observed between CR + R and CR groups (10% and 13%, respectively). Intrathoracic recurrence occurred in fewer patients in the radiotherapy groups (CR + R and PR + R) compared with the control groups (CR and PR) (four patients vs 15 patients; p = 0.01). In patients with residual tumor in the mediastinum after resection, two (7%) of 29 patients who underwent radiotherapy died of tracheobronchial obstruction, compared with nine (33%) of 27 patients in the control groups (p = 0.03). No difference in local recurrence was observed for extrathoracic or anastomotic recurrence. Distant metastasis developed in 12 patients (40%) in the CR + R group, nine patients (30%) in the CR group (p = 0.59), 24 patients (69%) in the PR + R group, and 18 patients (51%) in the PR group (p = 0.22). The time of onset of metastasis was 5.1 months for the PR + R group, which was shorter than the 8.5 months for the PR group (p = 0.05). The time of onset of metastasis was similar for the CR + R and CR groups (9.9 months and 11.0 months, respectively; p = 0.76). The overall median survival of patients after postoperative radiotherapy (CR + R and PR + R) was 8.7 months, which was shorter than the 15.2 months for the control groups (CR and PR) (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS. The shorter survival of patients who underwent postoperative radiotherapy was the result of irradiation-related death and the early appearance of metastatic diseases. The role of postoperative radiotherapy is therefore limited to a specific group of patients with residual tumor in the mediastinum after operation, for whom radiotherapy can significantly reduce the incidence of local recurrence obstructing the tracheobronchial tree</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="229"><COL><DATA> A prospective randomized trial was carried out to determine whether use of a high-pressure closed-suction intraperitoneal drain was associated with a reduction in morbidity rate after colorectal resection and to examine the influence of drainage on postoperative fluid collections. A consecutive series of 148 patients who underwent colonic or colorectal resection were randomized to receive no drain (n = 51) or a high-pressure closed-suction drain for either 3 (n = 47) or 7 (n = 47) days. Three patients were excluded. All patients underwent abdominal ultrasonography on days 3 and 7 and those undergoing left-sided colorectal resection (n = 96) received a water-soluble contrast enema on day 7. The three groups of patients were similar in age, sex, diagnosis and the numbers of sutured and stapled anastomoses. The presence of a drain did not influence the postoperative morbidity or mortality rate. If the anastomosis leaked, neither faeces nor pus emerged from the drain. Ultrasonographic detection of a fluid collection was of no value: such collections bore no relationship to radiological or clinical leaks or the postoperative course.

After a minimum follow-up of five years, the local recurrence rate was statistically significantly lower after preoperative than after postoperative radiotherapy (13 percent vs. 22 percent; P = 0.02). No difference in overall survival was noted (P = 0.5). To evaluate possible late side effects on the bowel, urinary bladder, or skin after surgery and additional preoperative or postoperative radiotherapy, all patients included in the randomized trial, together with 58 patients from a preceding pilot study with the same preoperative regimen, were studied in a prolonged follow-up program. The hospital files of all patients were re-examined. Of the patients who were carefully examined, 176 had a survival exceeding five years and 19 had a survival exceeding 10 years. Overall, 7 percent (33/464) either were operated upon or have had a radiologic diagnosis of small bowel obstruction: 14/255 (5 percent) after preoperative irradiation, 14/127 (11 percent) after postoperative irradiation, and 5/82 (6 percent) after surgery alone. The cumulative risk of developing a bowel obstruction was significantly increased after postoperative radiotherapy. Among the 98 patients alive after preoperative irradiation, significant morbidity from the bowel was noted in 11 patients, from the urinary bladder in two, and from the skin in six. In the postoperatively treated group of 34 patients, the bowel, urinary bladder, and skin morbidity were significant in five, two, and five patients, respectively. Corresponding morbidity in 44 nonirradiated patients was seen in five, one, and two patients, respectively.

To test the clinical consequences of this apparently immunosuppressive effect of homologous blood in a controlled trial, we designed a study in which the control group deposited autologous blood before their operations for use should transfusion be needed. We enrolled 120 patients with apparently curable colorectal cancer who were able to predeposit autologous blood (haemoglobin &gt; 12.5 g/dL). 62 patients were assigned to receive homologous blood if blood transfusions were needed during operation, and the other 58 to receive their own predeposited blood followed, if necessary, by homologous blood [corrected]. Despite the similarity between the groups in factors known to affect the risk of postoperative infections, there was a significant difference in postoperative infection rate between the homologous and autologous blood groups (17 [27%] vs 7 [12%], p &lt; 0.05; unadjusted odds ratio 2.75 [95% CI 1.07-7.11). The rates of non-infectious complications were similar Probably because their preoperative blood depositing caused the autologous blood patients to have lower haemoglobin concentrations, they were more likely to require transfusion than were the homologous blood group (53 [91%] vs 37 [60%], p &lt; 0.001; relative risk 1.53 [1.24-1.89]). 20 (35%) required homologous as well as autologous blood. To adjust for the many infection-related factors, we did multivariate regression analysis; tumour location, preoperative ASA index, and study group assignment were the only significant risk factors. The odds ratio for postoperative infections adjusted for these factors was 2.84 (1.02-7.98, homologous vs autologous). Testing of delayed-type hypersensitivity responses before and after surgery showed decreases in both mean diameter and number of positive reactions in recipients of homologous blood and slight increases in those who received autologous blood.

Mucosal cell proliferation was measured by in vitro incorporation of 5-bromo-2&apos;-deoxyuridine. Sulindac therapy was associated with a reduction in epithelial cell proliferation in the duodenum (median labelling index (LI) 15.8 versus 14.4 per cent, P = 0.003) and a trend towards duodenal polyp regression (P = 0.12). In the rectum, cell proliferation showed a marked reduction (median LI 8.5 versus 7.4 per cent, P = 0.018), and significant (P = 0.01) polyp regression was seen. Rectal polyposis was less severe than that in the duodenum and responded more dramatically.

DESIGN--Randomised study. SETTING--Gastrointestinal oncology departments. PATIENTS--40 previously untreated patients with histologically confirmed, measurable colorectal cancer that was locally recurrent or metastatic. INTERVENTIONS--Patients were allocated randomly to receive chemotherapy or only supportive care in a ratio of 2:1 according to performance status, metastatic disease of the liver, and weight loss in the six months before entering the study. Chemotherapy consisted of four week cycles of intravenous leucovorin (200 mg/m2/day) followed by 5-fluorouracil (550 mg/m2/day) and cisplatin (20 mg/m2/day), each drug being given on the first four days of the cycle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Length of survival and quality of life score with an optimised functional living index-cancer scale. RESULTS--Overall survival was significantly longer for patients given chemotherapy (11.0 months) than for those receiving supportive care alone (5.0 months; p = 0.006). Despite common association of chemotherapy with mild to moderate gastrointestinal symptoms, there was no significant difference between the two groups in global or subgroup quality of life scores. In patients with abnormal scores before treatment, quality of life seemed better in the chemotherapy arm. CONCLUSIONS--In this sample of patients with disseminated colorectal cancer the chemotherapy regimen was an effective form of palliative treatment</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="352"><COL><DATA> Doxifluridine (dFUR) is a fluoropyrimidine derivative that has shown activity on a variety of solid tumours. The purpose of this study was to compare its therapeutic effect with a standard fluorouracil (FU) regimen in patients with locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer. 222 previously untreated patients were randomised to receive dFUR (4000 mg/m2) or FU (500 mg/m2) daily for 5 days every 28 days. The primary tumour originated in the colon in two-thirds of the cases in both groups; approximately 90% of patients had metastatic extension, and liver involvement was present in 69% of the patients in the dFUR and FU groups. A good performance status (ECOG 0-1) was recorded in 90% of cases in both arms. A median of five cycles was administered to the patients (range 1-12). Only one partial response among 110 patients in the FU arm and one complete response and five partial responses out of 112 evaluable patients in the dFUR group were observed. Time to progression was significantly longer in the dFUR group (P = 0.02); overall survival, while longer in the dFUR arm (48 weeks vs. 39 weeks), was not significantly so (P = 0.08). Toxicity was acceptable in both arms, although grade 3-4 neurological side-effects and leukopenia were more common after dFUR infusion. Despite the low response rate, our results indicate that dFUR may be a superior alternative to FU. The possibility of enhancing significantly the activity of dFUR with biochemical modulators should be further investigated</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="360"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Patients with colon or rectal cancer were entered onto a prospectively randomized, controlled clinical trial of active specific immunotherapy (ASI) with an autologous tumor cell-bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. We investigated whether ASI could improve disease-free status and survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-eight patients with Dukes&apos; stage B2-C3 colon or rectal cancer were randomized into groups treated by resection alone or resection plus ASI. Eighty patients met all eligibility criteria. All patients with rectal cancer were to receive 50 Gy of pelvic irradiation. Analysis of distribution of survival and disease-free survival was made on all eligible patients until December 31, 1990. RESULTS: As a single study, no statistically significant differences were detected in survival or disease-free survival for all 80 eligible patients. However, since it was recognized at the outset that there were treatment differences, in that rectal cancer patients were to receive postimmunotherapy radiation, it was considered that a cohort analysis of the colon and rectal cancer patients might be informative. With a median follow-up of 93 months, there is a significant improvement in survival (two-sided P = .02; hazards ratio, 3.97) and disease-free survival (two-sided P = .039; hazards ratio, 2.67) in all eligible colon cancer patients who received ASI. With a median follow-up of 58 months, no benefits were seen in patients with rectal cancer who received ASI.

Seventy-seven consecutive patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group 1--nasogastric decompression was maintained postoperatively until resumption of bowel function; Group 2--the nasogastric tube was removed in the recovery room. Forty patients were assigned to Group 1 (21 males, 19 females) and 37 to Group 2 (22 males and 15 females). Eleven patients in Group 1 (28%) developed nausea postoperatively, with six patients (15%) having an average of less than two emeses and five (12%) requiring nasogastric reintubation. Thirteen patients in Group 2 (35%) developed nausea, with 10 patients (27%) having an average of two emeses and three (8%) requiring nasogastric intubation (P = 0.80). Abdominal distention was observed in 13 patients (32%) in both Group 1 (32%) and Group 2 (35%). Two of the latter patients required nasogastric reintubation. Postoperative fever was noted in 23 patients (58%) in Group 1 and 14 (38%) in Group 2 (P = 0.13); atelectasis was diagnosed in 38 per cent of patients in Group 1 and 14 per cent in Group 2 (P = 0.03). These data support that nasogastric decompression is not necessary following elective colorectal surgery for malignant and premalignant lesions</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="436"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND. Familial adenomatous polyposis is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the formation of hundreds of colorectal adenomas and eventual colorectal cancer. Administration of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug sulindac has been followed by regression of polyps in patients with this disorder, but no controlled trial of this drug in patients who have not had surgery has been reported. METHODS. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 22 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, including 18 who had not undergone colectomy. The patients received sulindac at a dose of 150 mg orally twice a day for nine months or identical-appearing placebo tablets. The number and size of the polyps were evaluated every three months for one year. RESULTS. A statistically significant decrease in the mean number of polyps and their mean diameter occurred in patients treated with sulindac, as compared with those given placebo. When treatment was stopped at nine months, the number of polyps had decreased to 44 percent of base-line values and the diameter of the polyps to 35 percent of base-line values (P = 0.014 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively, for the comparison with the changes in the group given placebo). No patient had complete resolution of polyps. Three months after treatment with sulindac was stopped, both the number and the size of the polyps increased in sulindac-treated patients but remained significantly lower than the values at base line. No side effects from sulindac were noted. CONCLUSIONS. Sulindac reduces the number and size of colorectal adenomas in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, but its effect is incomplete, and it is unlikely to replace colectomy as primary therapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="475"><COL><DATA> In an effort to identify the site of recurrent colorectal cancer in patients with occult metastasis and increasing serum CEA levels, we conducted two trials using monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) against CEA. The first utilized Indium-111-labeled ZCE-025; an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) anticarcinoembryonic antigen (anti-CEA) antibody (Hybritech, San Diego, CA). The second study used Tc-99m-labeled Fab&apos; fragment of IMMU-4 (Immunomedics, Morris Plains, NJ). Eighteen patients were imaged with the ZCE-025 and 14 with the Tc-99m Fab&apos; IMMU-4. True-positive scans, defined as at least one correct correlation of the MoAb scan and surgical/histologic findings, were observed in 12 of 15 patients undergoing exploration or biopsy using the ZCE-025 and 11 of 14 using the IMMU-4. There were no true-negative scans with the ZCE-025 and only 2 of 14 with the IMMU-4. There were 3 false-positive scans with the ZCE-025 and 1 of 14 with IMMU-4. There were no false-negative scans with either ZCE-025 or IMMU-4. Four (31%) of 13 patients undergoing exploration and imaged with ZCE-025 and 5 (36%) of 14 imaged with IMMU-4 had complete tumor resection. Treatment decisions were affected in 3 (16%) of 18 ZCE-025-imaged patients and 3 (21%) of 14 IMMU-4 ones. Two (14%) of 14 patients imaged with IMMU-4 had negative MoAb scans and negative laparotomies. Despite these findings, it is not known whether such early detection and resection will translate into improved survival rates. The authors suggest two randomized studies, one designed to ascertain the role of MoAb added to blind exploratory laparotomy. In that study, patients with increasing CEA levels and a negative workup will be randomized to an exploratory laparotomy preceded by MoAb anti-CEA scans or a straight exploratory laparotomy without the assistance of a MoAb anti-CEA scan. Endpoints will be differences in complete resectability and survival. A second study will examine the merits of blind exploratory laparotomies. In that study, patients with increasing CEA levels and a negative workup would be randomized to MoAb imaging, exploratory laparotomy, and radioimmunoguided surgery, and the other cohort of patients would continue to have conventional radiologic workup. Exploration in this latter group would be performed only when indicated by radiologic or endoscopic studies. The endpoint of the study would compare survival in the two cohorts of patients. These two studies may ultimately settle the debate regarding the correct approach to patients with occult metastatic colorectal cancer and a increasing levels of serum CEA</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="516"><COL><DATA> The influence of oxygen-derived free radicals on survival in advanced colonic cancer was assessed in a prospective randomized controlled double-blind trial using the radical scavengers dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and allopurinol.

In 193 fully evaluable patients who were studied for 5 years, allopurinol and DMSO incurred a significant (p &lt; 0.05) survival advantage over the whole period of study. The similarity in efficacy between allopurinol and DMSO and the fact that the only action they share is scavenging oxyradicals, suggest that these radicals mediate the detrimental effects of malignancy and that removing them incurs a survival advantage for patients with advanced colonic cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="517"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine if hepatic arterial therapy with floxuridine (F), mitomycin, and carmustine (BCNU) (FMB) is superior to hepatic arterial therapy with F alone in previously treated patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-five patients were randomized to intrahepatic FMB versus intrahepatic F. All patients had tumor progression after systemic chemotherapy (either therapeutic or adjuvant). RESULTS: There was no significant difference in response rate (47% FMB v 33% F; P = .17). Median survival was similar in the two groups, 19.1 months for the FMB group compared with 14.0 months for the F group (P = .23). The overall median survival was 16.8 months. In patients who received prior adjuvant therapy, there was no difference between the two groups, but response rate was high in both (50% FMB v 62% F). The response rate for all patients who had received only prior adjuvant therapy versus all those who had received prior therapy for metastatic disease was 57% and 35%, respectively (P = .066). In the subset of patients whose disease had progressed with prior systemic chemotherapy, the response rate to FMB was greater than that to F (47% v 23%; P = .035). CONCLUSION: The overall partial response rate of 39% and the overall survival of 16.8 months from initiation of intrahepatitis therapy show that hepatic arterial therapy is a reasonable treatment option for patients whose tumor does not respond to systemic therapy or whose disease progresses after adjuvant therapy for colorectal cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="536"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE AND METHODS: Doxorubicin alone or with dacarbazine (DTIC; AD) is considered the best available therapy for metastatic adult sarcomas. Ifosfamide is active in sarcomas that have failed to respond to a doxorubicin-based regimen. This study was designed to determine if ifosfamide added to doxorubicin and DTIC (ADI) significantly effects toxicity, response rate, and survival. Patients with measurable metastatic or unresectable sarcoma were randomized to receive AD or ADI. Patients with chondrosarcomas, fibrosarcomas, and other sarcomas of bone were eligible, although those with osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing&apos;s sarcoma, Kaposi&apos;s sarcoma, and mesothelioma were excluded, as were patients with prior chemotherapy for sarcoma or prior doxorubicin. RESULTS: Between 1987 and 1989, 340 eligible patients were randomized. Significantly more myelosuppression, a higher response rate (17% v 32%; P &lt; .002) and longer time to progression (4 v 6 months; P &lt; .02) were observed for patients who received ifosfamide. An overall survival advantage for the two-drug regimen (12 v 13 months; P = .04) was not significant by multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: In all three randomized trials of doxorubicin with and without ifosfamide (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG], European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC], and this study), the response rate was higher for the ifosfamide-containing arm, significantly so in this and the ECOG studies. An improved response rate may be particularly important for the preoperative management of high-grade, borderline resectable lesions or pulmonary metastases, particularly in younger patients. In older patients, or for low-to intermediate-grade lesions, doxorubicin and DTIC followed by ifosfamide on progression is preferred</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="541"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: This three-armed phase III study in adults with advanced soft tissue sarcomas was planned as a comparison of objective regression rates, toxicity, and survival of patients receiving doxorubicin alone, ifosfamide plus doxorubicin, and mitomycin plus doxorubicin plus cisplatin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between December 1987 and July 1990, 279 patients with histologically confirmed sarcomas were enrolled to receive treatment A (doxorubicin 80 mg/m2), treatment B (ifosfamide 7.5 g/m2 plus doxorubicin 60 mg/m2), or treatment C (mitomycin 8 mg/m2 plus doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 60 mg/m2). RESULTS: Of 262 assessable patients, 74 (29%) achieved objective tumor regression. Objective regression occurred in 20% of the 90 patients who received doxorubicin alone (complete remission [CR] rate, 2%), in 34% of the 88 who received ifosfamide plus doxorubicin (CR rate, 3%), and in 32% of the 84 who received mitomycin plus doxorubicin plus cisplatin (CR rate, 7%). With grade 3 or greater myelosuppression in 53% of group A, 80% of group B, and 55% of group C, regimen B was significantly more myelosuppressive than either regimen A or C (P = .01) with two, three, and one treatment-related deaths, respectively. Synovial sarcomas were responsive to ifosfamide plus doxorubicin, especially among patients younger than 40 years of age. CONCLUSION: Ifosfamide plus doxorubicin produced a significantly higher regression rate (P = .03) than did doxorubicin alone; however, this was achieved at a level of myelosuppression significantly more intense than that produced by the single agent or by the three-drug combination. Mitomycin, doxorubicin, and cisplatin also appeared to be more active than the single agent; however, at a myelosuppression level similar to that of doxorubicin alone, this trend (P = .07) did not attain the usual level for significance. No significant survival differences were observed</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="545"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: A prospective randomized trial evaluating adjuvant brachytherapy for soft tissue sarcomas was conducted between July 1982 and July 1987. METHODS AND MATERIALS: One hundred twenty-six patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or superficial trunk (STS) underwent grossly complete resection with limb-sparing surgery. Intra- operatively, patients were randomized to receive either adjuvant brachytherapy (BRT) or no further therapy (no BRT). BRT consisted of an Iridium-192 implant which delivered 4200-4500 cGy over 4-6 days. Total hospital stay for combined surgery and BRT was 10-14 days. Patients in each group were well matched with respect to age, sex, site, tumor size, depth, histologic type, and grade. Median follow-up is 66.5 months for all living patients. RESULTS: At 5 years, local control was 82% in the BRT group vs. 67% in the no BRT group (p = .049). When analyzed by histologic grade, high grade tumors had local control of 90% with BRT vs. 65% with no BRT (p = .013). There was no difference in local control in the low grade patients in either arm. At 5 years, the proportion free of distant metastases was approximately 76% in both arms, with no difference between BRT and no BRT. When analyzed by grade, high grade patients had a similar proportion free of distant metastasis in the BRT vs. no BRT arms despite improved local control in those receiving BRT. Similarly, the disease-specific survival for all patients at 5 years was 81% for BRT vs. 80% for no BRT (p = NS). When analyzed by grade, and treatment (BRT vs. no BRT), 5-year disease- specific survival for high grade was the same in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant BRT significantly improves local control in completely resected STS. This improvement is confined to patients with high grade histology. BRT provides excellent local control in this group, and significantly shortens the treatment time when compared to adjuvant external beam radiation. However, the improved local control does not translate into either decreased distant metastasis or increased disease-specific survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="720"><COL><DATA> Lipiodol injected into the hepatic artery is selectively retained in hepatomas so has been used as a vehicle for cytotoxic drugs. This study compared treatment with 5-epidoxorubicin emulsified in lipiodol and infused into the hepatic artery with symptomatic treatment alone in a randomised trial. Of 136 patients with hepatoma 78 (57%) were not eligible, eight (6%) refused to take part, and 50 entered the trial (chemotherapy: n = 25, symptomatic treatment: n = 25). The two groups had similar prognostic indices. Seven of 25 patients allocated to chemotherapy were unable to receive it. The slight survival disadvantage associated with chemotherapy was not significant (median survival 48 days compared with 51 days, log rank chi 2 = 0.07, p &gt; 0.05). Patients given chemotherapy spent significantly longer in hospital, however (median three days compared with one, p = 0.0008). Changes in symptoms and indices of tumour growth did not differ significantly between the two groups. It is concluded that infusion of 5-epidoxorubicin emulsified in lipiodol for hepatoma increased morbidity but did not affect survival.

The survival of interferon-alpha-treated patients was significantly better than that of patients who received no antitumor therapy (p = 0.0471); median lengths of survival were 14.5 and 7.5 wk, respectively. Objective tumor regression greater than 50% was observed in 31.4% (11 of 35) of patients receiving interferon-alpha. Interferon-alpha induced tumor regression greater than 50% in 11 (31.4%) patients.

METHODS: The authors prospectively studied helium-ion irradiation and iodine 125 (125I) brachytherapy in a randomized, dynamically balanced trial. Of the 184 patients who met the eligibility criteria, 86 were treated with helium ions and 98 with 125I brachytherapy. RESULTS: No patients with uveal melanoma had a history of systemic malignancy. Tumors were less than 15 mm in maximum diameter and less than 10 mm in thickness. A minimum tumor dose of 70 GyE was delivered to the tumor apex. There was a significantly higher local recurrence rate after 125I brachytherapy than after helium-ion irradiation.

The trial was specifically designed in order to resolve the controversy and to provide some definite answers regarding the value of adjuvant BCG treatment in stage I malignant melanoma. Patients were randomised to either BCG RIV (108 patients) or BCG Pasteur (109 patients) for 3 years or to follow-up only (110 patients). The two vaccines used had greatly divergent properties regarding their mode of preparation, their composition and their immunomodulating activities. Of the 353 randomised patients, 23 were ineligible, 3 refused participation after randomisation and 327 were evaluable for final analysis. Median follow-up time was 6 years (range 0-10 years). The log-rank test comparison showed no statistical difference between the three arms regarding time to progression (P = 0.55) and duration of survival (P = 0.82). Treatment was generally well tolerated, with no major adverse events in either treatment arm. These findings confirm data with different BCG preparations and with stage II melanoma which also demonstrated no benefit regarding patient survival and time to relapse</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="835"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy adjuvant to surgery in metastatic melanoma has been evaluated in only a few prospective randomized trials. In the treatment of metastatic melanoma, dacarbazine has response rates of 15%-25% and in several studies, when combined with other alkylating agents, has yielded even higher response rates. Among the highest response rates are those achieved by using high-dose chemotherapy regimens combined with autologous bone marrow support (transplantation). PURPOSE: We conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of high-dose alkylating agents in combination with autologous bone marrow support given as adjuvant therapy for high-risk stage II (World Health Organization) melanoma. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with metastases involving five or more lymph nodes were randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms within 8 weeks of lymphadenectomy: immediate treatment or observation only. The immediate-treatment arm consisted of 19 patients who, immediately after random assignment, received high-dose chemotherapy with alkylating agents, followed 3 days later by reinfusion of autologous bone marrow. The observation arm consisted of 20 patients who were observed until relapse (confirmed by biopsy) and were then treated with the identical high-dose alkylating agent chemotherapy followed by reinfusion of autologous bone marrow. Bone marrow was harvested from the patients under general anesthesia 1-2 weeks prior to chemotherapy and was cryopreserved. Chemotherapy consisted of intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide (1875 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion daily for 3 days), cisplatin (55 mg/m2 per day by continuous infusion over the same 72-hour period), and carmustine (BCNU) (600 mg/m2) given immediately after cisplatin on the 4th day as a 2-hour infusion. The total doses of the three drugs were 5625, 165, and 600 mg/m2, respectively. All patients received medical evaluations every 6-12 weeks over the study period. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to determine the time to disease progression on the basis of intent to treat. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival or in time to disease progression between the two treatment arms. However, the median time to progression was 16 weeks in the observation arm and 35 weeks in the immediate-treatment arm. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate adjuvant high-dose chemotherapy with alkylating agents followed by autologous bone marrow support more than doubled the time to disease progression compared with observation alone, though the difference was not statistically significant. No differences in overall survival were noted</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="836"><COL><DATA> Following extensive phase II trials of the combination of dacarbazine and interferon-alpha 2a we performed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of this combination versus dacarbazine alone as systemic therapy for symptomatic, measurable metastatic malignant melanoma. The two treatment arms were well matched for age, sex, performance, status, relapse-free survival, prior therapy and sites of disease. Therapy consisted of dacarbazine given in combination in escalating doses of 200 mg/m2, 400 mg/m2 and 800 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks, or alone at 800 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks. Interferon was administered subcutaneously starting at 3 mU daily on days 1-3, 9 mU daily on days 4-70, then 9 mU three times per week. Therapy was continued for at least 6 months unless overt progressive disease was observed. Eighty seven patients were randomized to the combination and 83 patients to dacarbazine alone. Response rates were respectively, complete 7% and 2%, and partial 14% and 15%, for a total response rate of 21% (95% confidence limits 13-31%) and 17% (95% confidence limits 10-27%). Median duration of response was 258 and 286 days, and survival of the whole groups 229 and 269 days respectively. Toxicity was worse in the combination arm, with more patients experiencing fatigue, nausea and anorexia, flu-like symptoms and neutropenia. However quality of life was not significantly different in either group, except that fatigue, as measured at week 12 by LASA scales, and activity, as measured by the functional living index, were both improved in the combination.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="837"><COL><DATA> A single dose of dacarbazine (DTIC), followed by a 5-day intravenous infusion of vindesine (VDS) was administered every 3 weeks to 103 patients with metastatic melanoma.

METHODS: Patients with 1- to 4-mm-thick melanomas on the trunk or proximal extremities were randomly assigned to receive either a 2- or 4-cm surgical margin. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 6 years. The local recurrence rate was 0.8% for 2-cm margins and 1.7% for 4-cm margins (p value not significant [NS]). The rates of in-transit metastases were 2.1% and 2.5%, respectively (p = NS). Of the six patients with local recurrences, five have died. Recurrence rates did not correlate with surgical margins, even among stratified thickness groups. The overall 5-year survival rate was 79.5% for the 2-cm margin patients and 83.7% for the 4-cm margin patients (p = NS). The need for skin grafting was reduced from 46% with 4-cm surgical margins to 11% with 2-cm surgical margins (p &lt; 0.001). The hospital stay was shortened from 7.0 days for patients receiving 4-cm surgical margins to 5.2 days for those receiving 2-cm margins (p = 0.0001). This reduction was largely due to reduced need for skin grafting, since the hospital stay for those who had a skin graft was 2.5 days longer than that for those who had a primary wound closure (p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: Margins of excision can be safely reduced to 2 cm for patients with intermediate-thickness melanomas. The narrower margins significantly reduced the need for skin grafting and shortened the hospital stay</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="946"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of fast neutron radiotherapy versus conventional photon and/or electron radiotherapy for unresectable, malignant salivary gland tumors a randomized clinical trial comparing was sponsored by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group in the United States and the Medical Research Council in Great Britain. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligibility criteria included either inoperable primary or recurrent major or minor salivary gland tumors. Patients were stratified by surgical status (primary vs. recurrent), tumor size (less than or greater than 5 cm), and histology (squamous or malignant mixed versus other). After a total of 32 patients were entered onto this study, it appeared that the group receiving fast neutron radiotherapy had a significantly improved local/regional control rate and also a borderline improvement in survival and the study was stopped earlier than planned for ethical reasons. Twenty-five patients were study-eligible and analyzable. RESULTS: Ten-year follow-up data for this study is presented. On an actuarial basis, there continues to be a statistically-significant p = 0.009) but there is no improvement in overall survival (15% vs. 25%, p = n.s.). Patterns of failure are analyzed and it is shown that distant metastases account for the majority of failures on the neutron arm and local/regional failures account for the majority of failures on the photon arm. Long-term, treatment-related morbidity is analyzed and while the incidence of morbidity graded &quot;severe&quot; was greater on the neutron arm, there was no significant difference in &quot;life-threatening&quot; complications. This work is placed in the context of other series of malignant salivary gland tumors treated with definitive radiotherapy.

In an attempt to decrease the toxic effects of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (FAMTX) by reducing the dose of methotrexate from 1500 mg/m2, according to the original regimen, to 1000 mg/m2, the authors designed the modified FAMTX treatment that was evaluated in a prospective Phase II-III randomized trial. METHODS. Patients with advanced gastric cancer were randomized to receive modified FAMTX treatment or supportive measures only (control group). In the middle of the study, the randomization was interrupted because of strong evidence of benefit in terms of tumor reduction and projected survival in the treatment arm receiving chemotherapy. By the end of the study, 30 assessable patients had received chemotherapy and 10 had received supportive treatment. RESULTS. The overall response rate was 50% (15 patients); 12 patients (40%) had partial responses and 3 (10%) had complete responses (CR). One patient with extensive peritoneal carcinomatosis attained a CR pathologically documented by laparoscopic examination and peritoneal biopsy. The median overall survival time of the treated group was 9 months, whereas that of the control group was only 3 months (P = 0.001). The median overall survival time of the responders was 16 months, and their median remission duration was 8 months. The regimen was well tolerated, with a very acceptable toxicity profile. There was one toxic death resulting from neutropenia and sepsis in a patient who did not receive adequate leucovorin rescue. CONCLUSIONS. This regimen appears to prolong survival in patients with advanced gastric cancer, and the reduction of the methotrexate dose does not seem to compromise its efficacy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="976"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND. With the introduction of cisplatin-containing regimens in the treatment of advanced gastric cancer, promising clinical results have been reported. A 61.5% response rate was observed with a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusion and bolus cisplatin; however, the superiority of cisplatin-containing regimens to other regimens has not been clearly verified in any randomized controlled studies. A prospective, randomized study of 5-FU and cisplatin (FP) versus 5-FU, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C (FAM) versus 5-FU alone (FU) in previously untreated patients with advanced gastric cancer is reported. METHODS. A total of 324 patients were entered into the trial and 295 patients (103 for FP, 98 for FAM, 94 for FU) were evaluable. The patients were randomized to receive FP, FAM, or FU after stratifying by the following factors: performance status, presence of measurable disease, and resection of the primary tumor. RESULTS. The overall response rate for patients with measurable disease in the FP arm was significantly higher than in the FAM and FU arms (51% for FP; 25% for FAM; 26% for FU). The durations of response for each arm, however, were not significantly different. Even though the median time to progression for the FP arm (21.8 weeks) was longer than that for the FAM arm (12 weeks; P &lt; 0.05) and for the FU arm (9.1 weeks; P &lt; 0.005), there was no statistical difference in overall survival among the three arms. Toxicity for all three regimens was moderate and consisted primarily of myelosuppression, nausea, vomiting, and alopecia. CONCLUSIONS. Although the FP regimen showed a significantly higher response rate and a longer time to progression than the FAM or FU regimens, a survival benefit was not observed</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1025"><COL><DATA> In a prospectively randomized trial evaluating pancreatic resection with adjuvant radiotherapy (intraoperative radiotherapy [IORT] vs. external beam radiotherapy [EBRT]), lymph nodal involvement was examined and correlated with outcome.

Regional nodal metastases were present in 15 of 26 (57%) patients. Seven patients suffered treatment-related mortality. Survival, mortality, and morbidity were unaffected by the type of radiotherapy. The survival of patients with negative nodes (median survival 24 months, range 10 to &gt; 109) appeared superior to the survival of patients with nodal involvement (median survival 11.5 months; range 4-39). Even in patients with locally advanced disease extending into extrapancreatic tissues, two node-negative patients appeared to survive longer (12 and 53 months) than 10 node-positive patients with similarly extensive local disease (median survival 11.5 months; range 4-39).

METHODS: Standardized assessment of pain, mood, and disability due to pain was completed preoperatively and at 2-month intervals until death. Chemical splanchnicectomy with alcohol was performed in 65 patients, whereas 72 patients received the placebo. The two groups were similar with respect to age, sex, location, and stage of tumor, operation performed, the use of postoperative chemo- and radiation therapy, and initial assessment scores for pain, mood, and disability. RESULTS: No differences in hospital mortality or complications, return to oral intake, or length of hospital stay were observed. Mean pain scores were significantly lower in the alcohol group at 2-, 4-, and 6-month follow-up and at the final assessment (p &lt; 0.05). To further determine the effect of chemical splanchnicectomy, patients were stratified into those with and without preoperative pain. In patients without preoperative pain, alcohol significantly reduced pain scores and delayed or prevented the subsequent onset of pain (p &lt; 0.05). In patients with significant preoperative pain, alcohol significantly reduced existing pain (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, patients with preexisting pain who received alcohol showed a significant improvement in survival when compared with controls (p &lt; 0.0001).

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: A prospective multicenter study between 1984-1987 including only histologically or cytologically verified adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (N = 442) or the papilla of Vater (N = 30); 84 patients (19%) with pancreatic carcinoma and 24 patients (80%) with papilla carcinoma underwent radical operations. A palliative procedure was performed in 252 patients (53%). METHODS: Clinical data, surgical procedures and the following morbidity and mortality were recorded on standardized forms. The risk factors were analyzed by a logistic multiple regression model. RESULTS: The morbidity, reoperation, and mortality rates were 43, 18, and 11% after radical surgery and 23, 4, and 14% after palliative surgery. Karnofsky&apos;s index was the sole independent risk factor for death after radical surgery. Splenectomy, age, and TNM stage influenced morbidity. Diabetes, Karnofsky&apos;s index, and liver metastases were risk factors in palliative surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The morbidity and mortality risks were comparable between total pancreatectomy and a Whipple&apos;s procedure and between biliary and a double bypass. Preoperative biliary drainage had no impact on the risks and may be abandoned. High age is a relative and a low Karnofsky&apos;s index an absolute contraindication for radical surgery. Nonsurgical palliation of jaundice should be considered according to the presence of independent risk factors</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1030"><COL><DATA> Between 1984 and 1987, 61 radically resected patients with carcinoma of the pancreas (n = 47) or the papilla of Vater (n = 14) were randomised either into postoperative adjuvant combination chemotherapy (AMF); 5-fluorouracil 500 mg/m2, doxorubicin 40 mg/m2, mitomycin C 6 mg/m2 (n = 30) once every 3 weeks for six cycles, or into a control group (no adjuvant chemotherapy) (n = 31). The median survival in the treatment group was 23 months compared with 11 months (P = 0.02, median test) in the control group, dependent on a survival benefit in the treatment group during the initial 2 years (P = 0.04 generalised Wilcoxon).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data are presented from 1,081 patients with Dukes&apos; stage B and C carcinoma of the colon entered into National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) protocol C-03 between August 1987 and April 1989. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either lomustine (MeCCNU), vincristine, and 5-FU (MOF), or leucovorin-modulated 5-FU (LV + 5-FU). The mean time on study was 47.6 months. RESULTS: Comparison between the two groups indicates a disease-free survival advantage for patients treated with LV + 5-FU (P = .0004). The 3-year disease-free survival rate for patients in this group was 73% (95% confidence interval, 69% to 77%), compared with 64% (95% confidence interval, 60% to 68%) for patients receiving MOF. The corresponding percentage of patients surviving was 84% for those randomized to receive LV + 5-FU and 77% for the MOF-treated cohort (P = .003). At 3 years of follow-up, patients treated with postoperative LV + 5-FU had a 30% reduction in the risk of developing a treatment failure and a 32% reduction in mortality risk compared with similar patients treated with MOF. CONCLUSION: Treatment with LV + 5-FU significantly prolongs disease-free survival and results in a significant benefit relative to overall survival. These findings, when considered together with results from a recent meta-analysis demonstrating a benefit from LV + 5-FU in advanced disease, provide evidence to support the concept of metabolic modulation of 5-FU</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1097"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Treatment using interleukin-2 (IL-2) alone or in conjunction with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells has been shown to mediate disease regression in selected patients with advanced cancer. PURPOSE: This prospective randomized trial was designed to determine whether the administration of LAK cells in conjunction with high-dose IL-2 alters response and survival rates, compared with those for IL-2 alone, in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: The 181 patients who had metastatic cancer that had failed to respond to standard therapy or who had disease for which no effective therapy existed received treatment with high-dose IL-2 alone or with LAK cells plus IL-2. Both treatment groups were to receive the same dose of IL-2 administered according to the same schedule. IL-2 doses were omitted depending on the tolerance of the patient. Of the 181 patients, 97 had renal cell cancer and 54 had melanoma. RESULTS: Median potential follow- up was 63.2 months. There were 10 complete responses among the 85 assessable patients who received IL-2 plus LAK cells, compared with four among the 79 who received IL-2 alone. There were 14 and 12 partial responses, respectively. Complete response continues in seven patients at 50-66 months. The 36-month actuarial survival with IL-2 plus LAK cells was 31%, compared with 17% with IL-2 alone (two-sided P value [P2] = .089). A trend toward improved survival was seen for patients with melanoma who received IL-2 plus LAK cells, compared with those who received IL-2 alone (24-month survival: 32% versus 15%; 48-month survival: 18% versus 4%; P2 = .064 [corrected]). None of 26 patients with melanoma who received IL-2 alone are alive; five of 28 who received IL-2 plus LAK cells are alive, and three continue in complete response. No difference in survival was seen in patients with renal cell cancer in the two treatment groups. There were six treatment- related deaths (3.3%); three were due to myocardial infarction. Other toxic effects resolved by discontinuation of IL-2. Many toxic effects were related to increased vascular permeability induced by IL-2. CONCLUSIONS: Some patients with metastatic cancer have prolonged remission when they are treated with high-dose IL-2 alone or in conjunction with LAK cells. Our results suggest a trend toward increased survival when IL-2 is given with LAK cells in patients with melanoma, but no trend was observed for patients with renal cell cancer.

All the patients were classified according to the FIGO staging system and in order to determine the tumor size objectively, an ultrasound scanning was done.

In the neoadjuvant group the same procedures were carried out but three courses of chemotherapy with the &quot;quick&quot; VBP scheme were given before the treatment. The new therapeutic strategy proved to be very useful in bulky tumors in which the clinical examination showed a cervix increased in size and the ultrasound scanning a volume larger than 60 c.c.

These were due to the fact that operability has been improved and the parametrial extension has been decreased as well as other risk factors such as vascular embolism, lymph node involvement, tumor-cervix quotient, and tumor volume.

Prognostic pathologic and clinical features for 10-year survival were determined from 22 pathologic and 5 clinical variables encountered in 1090 node-negative and 651 node-positive patients enrolled in NSABP protocol B-06. METHODS. All factors were first screened univariately. Those exhibiting P values &lt; 0.01 were entered into multivariate Cox regression models. The model with the best fit consisted of 951 negative-node and 496 node-positive patients. RESULTS. Better survival in node-negative patients was noted for whites rather than blacks, for patients with favorable tumor types (tubular, mucinous, papillary) rather than intermediate (lobular invasive, classical medullary, and not otherwise specified [NOS] combinations) or unfavorable forms (NOS pure and atypical medullary), and for tumors with good rather than poor nuclear grade. Number of nodal metastases, degree of tumor elastosis, and patient age younger than 40 years of age and 65 years of age and older in addition to nuclear grade and race were found significant for node-positive patients. Relative risks for combinations of these prognostic factors were multiplicative. CONCLUSIONS. The prognostic factors for node-negative patients were similar to those observed for this cohort at 8 years. Some differences noted between patients of both nodal groups in NSABP B-04 and B-06 may be related to selection requirements in the latter and hence different patient characteristics or more speculatively a change in tumor biology</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="38"><COL><DATA> A prospective assessment of late changes in breast appearance in 559 patients after tumour excision and radiotherapy for early breast cancer noted a strong association with breast size.

The median disease-free survival (DFS) duration was 26 months for observation and 82 months for TAM patients (P = .007). This was mainly due to the reduction of further local recurrences, whereas the occurrence of early distant metastases was delayed. A multivariate analysis identified DFI and treatment with TAM as significant prognostic factors for DFS. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 76% and 74%, respectively (P = .77). DFI was also a prognostic factor for OS. CONCLUSION: Systemic therapy with TAM after isolated locoregional recurrence of breast cancer significantly increased 5-year DFS rates from 36% to 59% compared with observation alone and prolonged median DFS by more than 4.5 years in patients with ER+ tumors or in the case of unknown ER status with a DFI of greater than 12 months and minimal tumor burden. Treatment with TAM currently has no significant impact on OS, but the median survival duration of the study population has not yet been reached</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="41"><COL><DATA> Paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ), the first taxane to enter routine clinical practice, has aroused considerable interest due to its novel mechanism of action and its significant activity in metastatic breast cancer. Given this activity, it seemed logical to attempt to combine paclitaxel with doxorubicin, the other most active single agent in metastatic breast cancer. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performed two trials investigating paclitaxel/doxorubicin combinations in patients with advanced breast cancer in an attempt to identify a tolerable dose and schedule of the combination. In the first trial, paclitaxel and doxorubicin were alternated every 3 weeks in doses of 200 mg/m2 and 75 mg/m2, respectively, for patients who had received no more than one prior chemotherapeutic regimen. Therapy was well tolerated in this setting. At these doses, paclitaxel induced more granulocytopenia and less thrombocytopenia than did doxorubicin. Objective responses (complete and partial responses) were seen in seven of 12 patients; two other patients had improved disease (relief of pain in bony metastases). A second limited-institution Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial evaluated paclitaxel and doxorubicin given in combination. In this phase I trial, doxorubicin was given as an intravenous push and paclitaxel as a 24-hour continuous infusion. The sequence of drug administration (D--&gt;P or P--&gt;D) was alternated both between and within patients, so that we might evaluate the effect of administration schedule on toxicity. Therapy was begun at an initial paclitaxel dose of 150 mg/m2 and an initial doxorubicin dose of 50 mg/m2 in six patients, with a subsequent six patients receiving 175 and 60 mg/m2, respectively, of paclitaxel and doxorubicin. In addition, patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 5 micrograms/kg/d. While therapy at the initial dose level was well tolerated, dose-limiting mucositis was seen at the second dose level, although only when paclitaxel preceded doxorubicin. This suggests that sequence of drug administration in paclitaxel-based regimens may play an important role as a determinant of toxicity and (perhaps) efficacy, a finding similar to that seen when paclitaxel and cisplatin were combined in patients with ovarian cancer. Based on this study, we identified the sequence of doxorubicin (50 mg/m2) followed by paclitaxel (150 mg/m2) to be the maximum tolerated dose. This combination is currently being compared with paclitaxel alone and doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced breast cancer in an intergroup trial led by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="42"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Oophorectomy is one of the treatments of choice for premenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. However, in recent years LH-RH analogs have replaced surgical castration (or ovarian irradiation) on the basis of the comparable therapeutic activity shown by these drugs in phase II studies. Moreover, the combination of tamoxifen and LH-RH analogs has gained popularity among clinicians attempting to obtain a &apos;total estrogen blockade&apos; according to the same rationale previously proposed for advanced prostatic cancer. However, it has thus far not been proven that medical castration is as effective as oophorectomy or ovarian irradiation, nor is there enough evidence that tamoxifen could improve the efficacy of ovarian ablation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-five perimenopausal patients with estrogen receptor or unknown positive metastatic breast cancer were randomly allocated to receive one of the following treatments: surgical castration (or ovarian irradiation); goserelin; surgical castration (or ovarian irradiation) plus tamoxifen; goserelin plus tamoxifen. The study was performed according to a 2 x 2 factorial randomised design. RESULTS: While overall there was no significant difference in the response rates observed after two by two grouping, a trend did favour oophorectomy (or ovarian ablation) with respect to treatment activity. In fact, the best response rate was observed in patients allocated to this treatment (46.6% OR -95% CL: 21.2-72.9) while the lowest rate was observed in patients treated with oophorectomy plus tamoxifen (11.1% OR: CL: -3.4-25.6). Response to goserelin and goserelin plus tamoxifen was 27.2% (+/- 18.6) and 45% (+/- 21.8), respectively. Logistical regression analysis suggested that there might be a different interaction between tamoxifen and goserelin or oophorectomy (ovarian irradiation), respectively. Nevertheless, patient survivals were comparable, irrespective of allocated treatment. This indicates that two by two grouping has some value with respect to treatment efficacy and shows that oophorectomy (or ovarian irradiation) and goserelin have comparable efficacies. Tamoxifen did not improve the efficacy of gonadal ablation, although it did enhance the activity of goserelin treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study confirm prospectively that the efficacy of chemical castration is comparable to that of oophorectomy (or ovarian irradiation). The concurrent use of tamoxifen can probably enhance the activity of goserelin, but it also induces more side effects. However, it doesn&apos;t appear that &apos;total estrogen blockade&apos; is more effective than gonadal ablation alone. Indeed, the question of whether chemical and surgical castration have the same effect in breast cancer is still open as is the one concerning the interaction between tamoxifen and gonadal ablation. Both questions should be addressed by prospective studies</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="43"><COL><DATA> Eighty-five postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive aminoglutethimide (AG), medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), or AG+MPA. Patients with aggressive visceral disease were excluded. Response was observed in 36% of the patients in the AG treatment group, 31% in the MPA treatment group, and 47% in the combination treatment group. Statistical analysis showed that the percentage of responders was not different among the three treatment groups. Similarly, the duration of response did not differ. Toxicity of all three regimens was moderate, not necessitating discontinuation of treatment. In conclusion, AG, MPA and the combination of AG+MPA were found to be equally effective therapies for metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with nonaggressive visceral disease. The lack of statistically significant superiority of the combination of AG+MPA suggests that sequential endocrine monotherapies may be more beneficial than combined hormonotherapies for this patient population</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="44"><COL><DATA> A randomized double-blind trial has shown that, in 160 women with breast cancer undergoing lumpectomy or mastectomy with axillary clearance, perioperative and postoperative administration of tranexamic acid 1 g three times daily resulted in a significant reduction in the mean postoperative drainage volume compared with patients given placebo (283 versus 432 ml, P &lt; 0.001). The frequency of postoperative seroma formation was also decreased by tranexamic acid administration (27 versus 37 per cent, P = 0.2). Haematoma formation was infrequent in both groups and was not altered by administration of tranexamic acid. No infectious complications occurred.

Paclitaxel currently is administered by prolonged intravenous infusion because of the occurrence of severe hypersensitivity reactions in patients in early clinical trials. However, intensive premedication probably is more important in eliminating allergic reactions than is the length of infusion. The authors evaluated the feasibility of two paclitaxel schedules using a 1-hour, outpatient infusion. METHODS. Fifty-six patients with advanced, refractory malignancies were randomized to receive one of two paclitaxel schedules: 135 mg/m2 administered as a single dose over 1 hour, or 135 mg/m2 administered in divided daily doses for 3 days, each over 1 hour. All patients were premedicated with dexamethasone, diphenhydramine, and cimetidine. RESULTS. No serious hypersensitivity reactions occurred with either schedule of paclitaxel. In addition, other adverse effects were usually mild and easily tolerated. Other than alopecia, which occurred in all patients, myelosuppression was the most common severe toxicity. However, grade 3 leukopenia occurred in only 19% of treatment courses, and grade 4 leukopenia (nadir &lt; 1000/microL) occurred in only 2%. Nine patients required hospitalization for treatment of infection associated with neutropenia. No significant differences in toxicity were observed when the two paclitaxel regimens were compared. Although it is too early to assess the results adequately, preliminary findings showed that thus far 11 of 56 patients (20%) had a partial or complete response to therapy. Responses were observed in patients with breast, ovarian, and lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS. Paclitaxel can be safely administered in a 1-hour infusion in an outpatient setting, either as a single dose or in divided doses for three days. Severe hypersensitivity reactions did not occur in 162 treatment courses, and neutropenia was mild in most patients. Incorporation of this dose and these schedules of paclitaxel into combination chemotherapy regimens should be feasible. An investigation of higher paclitaxel doses given in a 1-hour infusion is currently in progress</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="46"><COL><DATA> One hundred patients with advanced carcinoma undergoing highly cytotoxic chemotherapy were enrolled in a prospective randomized trial comparing subcutaneous G-CSF, thymopentin, a combination of the two, and placebo as preventive treatment of febrile leukopenia.

Adjuvant chemotherapy is widely used for breast cancer and is known to extend survival. Some clinicians seek a greater survival benefit by increasing the intensity of the dose, whereas others lower it to diminish toxicity. METHODS. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) conducted a randomized trial of different levels of doses and dose intensity (dose per unit of time) of adjuvant chemotherapy in 1572 women with node-positive, stage II breast cancer who were assigned to three treatment groups. One group received 400 mg of cyclophosphamide per square meter of body-surface area and 40 mg of doxorubicin per square meter once every 28 days and 400 mg of fluorouracil per square meter twice every 28 days, for six cycles. Another group received 50 percent higher doses of the three drugs (600 mg, 60 mg, and 600 mg, respectively) but for only four cycles, so that the total dose was identical in these two groups but the dose intensity was higher in the first. The third group of women received half the total dose used in the other two groups and at half the dose intensity used in the second group. RESULTS. After a median of 3.4 years of follow-up, the women treated with a high or moderate dose intensity had significantly longer disease-free survival (P &lt; 0.001) and overall survival (P = 0.004) than those treated with a low dose intensity, in three-way log-rank comparisons. However, the difference in survival between the two groups treated with a moderate or high dose intensity was not significant. These results are consistent with either a dose-response effect or a threshold level of the dose or dose intensity. CONCLUSIONS. The doses of chemotherapy used to treat breast cancer, especially early breast cancer, should not be reduced if the maximal benefit is to be achieved</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="50"><COL><DATA> A prospective randomised multicentre clinical study was undertaken for 2 years and 3 months from November 1982, with the aim of examining the significance of using a combination of ftorafur (FT) and tamoxifen (TAM) for post-operative adjuvant therapy of breast cancer. Patients had either stage II or stage IIIa disease, were age 75 or below and had undergone radical mastectomy. Patients were divided into two groups and received one of the following treatment protocols: treatment A, intravenous administration of doxorubicin (DOX), 20 mg on the day of surgery and 10 mg the next day, followed by oral FT 50 mg day-1 for 2 years from the 14th day; treatment B, the same pattern of DOX administration for the first 2 days, followed by a combined therapy of FT and TAM 20 mg day-1 for 2 years. The number of patients was 546 (treatment A 274 and treatment B 272), of whom 34 (6%) were ineligible. The remaining 512 patients (treatment A 254 and treatment B 258) were followed up for 5 years for analysis. Significantly higher 5 year disease-free rate and 5 year survival rates were observed with treatment B compared with treatment A. When seen in terms of background factors, node-positive patients appeared to derive more benefit from tamoxifen than node-negative patients, but the oestrogen receptor-negative and premenopausal subgroups appeared to derive about the same benefit as those who were oestrogen receptor positive and post-menopausal. Indeed, survival in the premenopausal group was significantly better with tamoxifen (P = 0.04). No increase in side-effects was seen by combining TAM with FT.

Menopausal women with a history of breast cancer are advised against estrogen therapy because of concerns that ERT may adversely affect the course of the disease. There have been no prospective studies that address the issue of risk versus benefit for ERT in women with a history of breast cancer. We have initiated a randomized, prospective clinical study to define the influence, if any, of ERT on the clinical course of breast cancer (measure of potential risk) and the efficacy of ERT in the treatment of metabolic bone derangements (measure of benefit). Changes in serum lipids, cardiovascular events, and indices of psychological well-being are compared but do not constitute statistical end points. Eligible women must have had stage I or stage II breast cancer and must have had no evidence of disease for at least 2 years since therapy if estrogen-receptor-negative disease or for at least 10 years if the estrogen-receptor status is unknown. They were randomized to receive ERT (Premarin at 0.625 mg, days 1-25) versus no intervention (study control). Parameters of benefit and risk will be measured to detect a 10% change in disease-free rate for up to 5 years, with interim analyses at 20, 30, and 36 months of patient accrual.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients initially received either tamoxifen 20 mg/d orally or MPA 1 g/d orally. At the time of disease progression, patients were crossed over to the other regimen. Eligibility required patients to be age &gt; or = 18 years, performance status 0 to 3, and estrogen receptor (ER)- or progesterone receptor (PR)-positive or unknown. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-two eligible patients were entered and 166 were assessable for response. Complete plus partial response rates for tamoxifen and MPA were 17% and 34%, respectively (P = .01). Patients with bone metastases had a significantly higher partial response rate with MPA compared with tamoxifen (33% v 13%). Median time to treatment failure was 5.5 months for tamoxifen and 6.3 months for MPA (P = .48). The median survival duration was 24 months for tamoxifen and 33 months for MPA (P = .09). Multivariate analysis showed that treatment significantly influenced response rate, but not time to treatment failure or survival. After treatment failure following MPA, six of 42 patients (14%) treated with tamoxifen responded, compared with six of 49 (12%) treated with MPA following tamoxifen. Both agents were associated with minimal toxicity, but 35% of patients on MPA gained more than 20 lb as opposed to only 2% on tamoxifen. CONCLUSION: In this trial, initial treatment with MPA of endocrine-naive metastatic breast cancer patients was associated with a significantly higher response rate but not with improvement in time to treatment failure or survival, when compared with initial treatment with tamoxifen.

The cumulative curves indicated no difference between the two groups in either disease-free survival or overall survival.

At a median follow-up of 6 years (range 3-11 years) and at the censoring date there were 61 first events in the tamoxifen group. Fifty three patients developed local relapse or progression of the cancer; three patients had simultaneous local progression or relapse and distant metastases.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine if treatment of stage I breast cancer by strictly standardized surgical technique with meticulous confirmation of a complete excision can reduce the local recurrence rate to an acceptable level without routine adjuvant radiotherapy. METHODS: In this trial conducted in Sweden, 381 women with stage I breast cancer were surgically treated by sector resection plus axillary dissection; then 184 women were randomly selected to receive postoperative radiotherapy to the breast (XRT group), and 197 women received no further treatment (non-XRT group). Patient accrual started in October 1981 and ended in September 1988. Criteria for eligibility were a unifocal cancer 20 mm or less in diameter (visible on mammogram) and radical excision and no histopathologic signs of axillary metastases. RESULTS: After median follow-up times of 65 and 63 months, the 5-year local recurrence rate was 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1%-4.3%) in the XRT group and 18.4% (95% CI = 12.5%-24.2%) in the non-XRT group, respectively. The life-table curves were significantly different (P = .0001). The two treatment groups did not differ in overall survival: For the XRT group, the value was 91.0% (95% CI = 86.4%-95.4%); for the non-XRT group, it was 90.3% (95% CI = 85.8%-94.8%). The same was true for survival free from regional and distant recurrence: XRT group, 90.0% (95% CI = 85.3%-94.5%); non-XRT group, 87.1% (95% CI = 82.3%-92.0%). The rate of local recurrences was significantly higher in patients treated more recently (P. = 003). CONCLUSIONS: Sector resection plus radiotherapy to the breast very effectively achieves local tumor control. Surgery alone results in similar survival prospects, but the probability of local recurrence approaches 20% at 5 years. IMPLICATIONS: The increase in recurrence rate observed over time suggests that surgical technique and patient selection should be improved. The benefits of reduced cost and patient inconvenience that would result from the elimination of postoperative radiotherapy must be carefully weighed against the disadvantages of local recurrence. Longer term follow-up must be done to estimate the risk of cancer recurrence in these women 10 and 15 years later, and methods must be developed to identify those women who have a higher risk of recurrence. Finally, economic analyses of this and similar trials are needed to give empirical underpinnings for optimal use of radiotherapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="174"><COL><DATA> From 1990 to 1991, 40 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic oesophagus were admitted to our institutions and chemotherapy (oil Bleomycin p.o. and CDDP d.i.v.) either combined with or without hyperthermia was performed, in a prospective randomized trial carried out to investigate the effects of hyperthermia.

Twenty-four patients were randomized to receive 2 cycles of chemotherapy, cis-platinum 100 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, bleomycin 10 mg/m2 loading dose on day 3, followed by 10 mg/m2/day continuous intravenous infusion on days 4 through 7, and vinblastine 3 mg/m2 given intravenously on days 1, 8, 15, 22.

These findings demonstrate that although this chemotherapy regimen had some effect on squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus, it did not improve survival.

Patients were included on the basis of the following criteria: squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, younger than 70 years of age, World Health Organization status below 2, estimated survival time greater than 3 months, and no previous treatment for the cancer. Patients were not included if they had experienced a loss in body weight greater than 15% or had tracheoesophageal fistula, metastases, or uncontrollable infection. RESULTS. Eighty-six patients thus fulfilled the criteria for inclusion (41 CRT, 45 non-CRT). The groups were well-matched for age, sex, tumor location, size, and grade. Operative mortality was 8.5% and 7%, respectively, for each group with a 27-day hospital stay for both groups. Long-term survival was not significantly different, with 47% of both groups alive at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS. The authors concluded that this neoadjuvant treatment did not change operative mortality or survival time for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="228"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND. Because of experimental and preliminary clinical evidence that additional modulation of the biochemical pharmacology and cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) may be possible by combination of these agents with cisplatin (CDDP), the authors undertook a prospective randomized trial in patients with colorectal cancer. METHODS. Between 1989 and 1992, 138 patients with advanced measurable colorectal cancer previously unexposed to chemotherapy were randomly assigned to treatment with either 5-FU (425 mg/m2) and LV (20 mg/m2) for 5 days, or the combination of 5-FU and LV in the same daily dose plus cisplatin (20 mg/m2), each drug given for 4 consecutive days. In both treatment arms, courses were administered every 28 days, if toxicity allowed, for a total of 6 months or until evidence of tumor progression. RESULTS. The overall responses (complete and partial response) were 19% and 28% for the 5-FU/LV and the 5-FU/LV/CDDP treatment arms, respectively. Although the three-drug combination appeared superior to 5-FU/LV for time to progression or death (8.5 versus 5.2 months; P = 0.042), there was no evidence that the adoption of cisplatin will translate into a definite survival advantage. A comparative analysis of the toxicities experienced by the patients in the two treatment groups showed a comparable rate, although severe side effects (P &lt; 0.05), specifically stomatitis (P = 0.013), were noticed more frequently in patients treated with 5-FU/LV for 5 days. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that the therapeutic index of 5-FU/LV in metastatic colorectal cancer may be improved with the addition of cisplatin. However, the somewhat better therapeutic activity and lower incidence of severe gastrointestinal side effects have to be weighed against additional pharmaceutical charges and the need for a more intense antiemetic regimen</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="259"><COL><DATA> Beginning in 1975, 78 patients with resected stage B and C colorectal carcinoma were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either levamisole 2.5 mg kg-1 day-1 given for 2 days every week for 18 months or placebo therapy in the same schedule. Pretreatment characteristics (age, gender, disease site, CEA and stage) and the pattern of follow-up were similar in both groups. For the first 5 years following randomisation, relapse-free survival and overall survival were similar in the two treatment groups. Subsequently, excess late mortality was associated with levamisole group assignment. Consequently, overall survival was somewhat greater in the placebo group than in the levamisole group, 68% vs 38% (P &lt; 0.08). For patients surviving 5 years from randomisation, subsequent survival favoured placebo over levamisole (100% vs 57%; P &lt; 0.03). The absolute numbers of deaths were 27 in the levamisole group (19 definitely cancer related) and seven in the group placebo (five definitely cancer related). This long-term result seen with a more intensive adjuvant levamisole dose and schedule suggests: (1) other levamisole adjuvant trials in patients with colorectal cancer should be examined for long-term outcome; (2) future trials utilising the even higher levamisole dosage required for clinical immunomodulation should proceed cautiously</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="261"><COL><DATA> Patients given preoperative radiotherapy (31.5 Gy in 18 fractions) in a prospective, randomized trial of presumably operable rectal adenocarcinoma, were examined for a possible relation between bowel toxicity manifested as diarrhoea, and tumour size in the operative specimen, in addition to recurrence rate.

Patients without significant radiation-induced diarrhoea had also more recurrences (37.5% against 14.3%, p = 0.01). The disease-specific survival rate was also significantly better (p = 0.02) at 1.5 and 10 years in patients with diarrhoea WHO grade 3 and 4; 89.5%, 75.9% and 65.1% compared to 83.5%, 49.3% and 44.4% in patients with no or minimal radiation-induced loose bowels.

Of 468 patients (mean age 67 years, range 31-94, 273 males) who met the entry criteria, 228 were randomised to radiotherapy (3 x 5 Gy over 5 days within 2 days of operation) followed by surgery, and 239 to surgery alone. Randomisation was unknown in 1 patient. Follow-up to death or 5 years was achieved in 454 (97%) patients. 31 (7%) of the 468 patients died within 30 days of operation (radiotherapy and surgery 21 [9%], surgery alone 10 [4%]; P &lt; 0.05). Cardiovascular and thromboembolic complications were more common after radiotherapy and surgery (30, 13%) than after surgery alone (8, 3%; P &lt; 0.005). Of the 280 patients who had curative surgery, 52% of those who had radiotherapy and surgery and 56% of those who had surgery alone survived 5 years (P = 0.88). 395 patients attended outpatients clinics at least once.

After a minimum follow-up of 4 years, 156 patients who developed local recurrence were studied retrospectively. There were no differences concerning symptoms and the site of local recurrence between irradiated and non-irradiated patients. Curative treatment was rarely possible and median survival was only about 1 year, irrespective of adjuvant treatment. Local recurrence was the only manifestation of disease in 30-50 per cent of patients.

METHODS: A total of 284 patients were entered into the trial between 1982 and 1986; 141 were allocated to receive surgical treatment alone, and 143 were allocated to receive preoperative radiotherapy. A 10 x 10 x 10 cm volume in the posterior pelvis, centered on the tumor, was irradiated at a dose of 20 Gy, divided into four daily fractions of 5 Gy each. RESULTS: No differences were observed in any of the clinicopathologic variables in the two arms of the trial; there were no striking down-staging effects in the irradiated tumors. After a minimum follow-up period of 96 months, the overall and cancer-related mortality rates were similar in both arms of the study (P = 0.21 and P = 0.09, respectively). There was a highly significant reduction in local recurrences in the irradiated group (12.8 percent x-ray therapy vs. 36.5 percent surgery; P = 0.0001). The majority of local recurrences after preoperative radiotherapy occurred inside the radiotherapy field (10 cases; 7 percent), with only six cases (5 percent) outside the field. No significant difference was observed in the rates of distant metastasis between the two treatment groups (P = 0.73). CONCLUSIONS: Although there is no statistically significant survival benefit in the whole series, there is a survival benefit for the subset of patients considered by the surgeon to have undergone a curative operation. We recommend that this form of adjuvant therapy should be offered to all patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who are to undergo radical surgery</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="385"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: This study was developed to compare median and actuarial survival after left hemicolectomy vs. left segmental colectomy. METHODS: Between January 1980 and January 1985, 270 consecutive patients (133 males and 137 females; mean age, 64 +/- 12 (range, 18-91) years with left colonic carcinoma located between the left third of the transverse colon and (but not, including) the colorectal juncture were randomly allotted to undergo either left hemicolectomy or left segmental colectomy. Left hemicolectomy removed the entire left colon along with the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery and the dependent lymphatic territory. Left segmental colectomy removed a more restricted segment of the colon and left the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery unmolested. RESULTS: After elimination of 10 patients for protocol violation, 131 patients with left hemicolectomy and 129 with left segmental colectomy were analyzed. Both groups were similar with regard to preoperative risk factors (age, sex, obesity, weight loss, anemia, diabetes, cirrhosis, kidney failure, steroid therapy or radiation therapy performed for any cause other than cancer), pathology findings (size, degree of differentiation, Dukes stage, invasion of lymph nodes at the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery), and associated lesions. Only the length of tumor-free margins of colon removed was significantly longer in left hemicolectomy. The number of early postoperative abdominal and extra-abdominal complications was similar in both groups. Overall, early postoperative mortality was 4 percent higher, but not significantly in left hemicolectomy (eight deaths, 6 percent) than in left segmental colectomy (three deaths, 2 percent). Median survival was 10 years and nearly equivalent in both groups. The two actuarial survival curves were similar. Bowel movement frequency was significantly increased after left hemicolectomy during the first postoperative year. Our results suggest that survival after left segmental colectomy is equivalent to that of left hemicolectomy. Notwithstanding the observation of other carcinologic rules, left segmental colectomy rather than left hemicolectomy may theoretically be performed under laparoscopy without compromising the carcinologic outcome</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="440"><COL><DATA> Fifty patients were randomized to receive adjuvant intraperitoneal 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 500 mg/m2/day) and intravenous leucovorin (60 mg/m2/day) and 51 to receive placebo after curative surgery for colorectal cancer. Treatment started on the day after surgery and continued for 6 days. One case of stomatitis, one of leucopenia and one case of abnormal liver function tests were the only chemotherapy-related toxic effects. From the second day of treatment, pain during intraperitoneal infusions occurred more frequently in the 5-FU group, although statistical significance was only attained on day 2 (P &lt; 0.05). The groups did not differ substantially regarding any other adverse effects, the incidence of surgical complications, second laparotomies, time from surgery to discharge, or premature treatment terminations. The postoperative course after intraperitoneal 5-FU and intravenous leucovorin was thus not more complicated than that in patients treated with placebo. The tolerance was acceptable and chemotherapy-related toxicity was rare. Thus important prerequisites exist for more widespread use of the present regimen in order to evaluate its impact on survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="462"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to quantify the correlation between irradiated small bowel volume and late occurring small bowel complications. METHODS: Small bowel volumes in the high-dose region were measured using orthogonal barium films for 203 patients treated for rectal carcinoma with pelvic postoperative radiotherapy to 50 Gy in an EORTC multicentric study. RESULTS: The 5-year estimate of late pelvic small bowel obstruction requiring surgery was 11%. No correlation between the irradiated small bowel volume and obstruction was detected. The actuarial 5-year estimate of chronic diarrhea varied from 31% in patients with irradiated small bowel volumes below 77 cm3 to 42% in patients with volumes over 328 cm3. This correlation was significant in the univariate and multivariate analysis (p = 0.025). The type of rectal surgery significantly influenced the incidence of chronic diarrhea and malabsorption, the actuarial 5-year estimate being 49% and 26% after low anterior resection and abdominoperineal resection, respectively (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that there is a volume-effect in radiation-induced diarrhea at a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. No volume-effect for small bowel obstruction was detected at this dose-level in pelvic postoperative radiotherapy. A review of the literature data on small bowel obstruction indicates that the volume effect at this dose level can only be demonstrated in patients who were treated with extended field radiotherapy (estimated small bowel volume 800 cm3) after intra-abdominal surgery.

The anastomosis time averaged 24 minutes in the suture group and 16 minutes in the stapling group. Five post-operative complications occurred in each group.

In the treatment 10 mg of Propioni bacteria were administered intravenously between the seventh and third day prior to surgical treatment. At the time of operation 21 tumours were classified as stage I (treatment n = 12, control n = 9), 22 as stage II (treatment n = 10, control n = 2). Postoperatively wound infections requiring treatment were more prevalent in the control group (n = 4) than in the treated group (n = 0). All patients were subsequently followed up for 76 months. For stage I carcinoma the survival rates, excluding perioperative deaths, were 91% in the treated and 63% in the control group respectively. One case of tumour metastasis was seen in the control group. For stage II carcinoma the survival rate was 90% for the treated group with distant spread in 1 case and 45% in the control group where the rate of recurrence was 55%.

We have investigated whether a treatment to slow the growth of liver metastases, hepatic-artery infusion of floxuridine, improves palliation in this setting. In a randomised study of 100 patients, we compared quality of life and survival in patients who received hepatic-artery infusion of floxuridine and in those who received conventional symptom palliation. 95% of control patient survival time was spent with normal quality-of-life scores, which suggests that the aim of treatment should be to prolong normal-quality survival rather than merely to sustain quality of life. There was a significant prolongation (p = 0.03) in overall survival in floxuridine-treated patients compared with controls (median 405 vs 226 days). There were similar significant prolongations in normal-quality (ie, normal symptom scores) survival for physical symptoms (p = 0.04), anxiety (p = 0.04), and depression (p = 0.04). This survival benefit was associated with significant reductions in metastasis size on computed tomography (p = 0.001) and in serum carcinoembryonic antigen concentration (p = 0.006) in floxuridine-treated patients. There was no evidence of treatment-related hepatotoxicity as assessed by serum aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin measurements. This is the first demonstration that survival can be prolonged with normal quality of life in patients with colorectal liver metastases.

Regional therapy for colorectal liver metastases aimed at prolonging survival has not been tested fully in a randomized trial with untreated control subjects. This study explored the efficacy of temporary hepatic artery occlusion followed by intraportal infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oral allopurinol as biochemical modulators in prolonging the survival of patients with nonresectable liver metastases and no extrahepatic cancer. METHODS. Eighty-four patients were considered for randomization, of whom 24 were excluded at laparotomy because of extrahepatic cancer (n = 17) or resectable lesions (n = 5). In two patients, no cancer was identified in the liver. Thirty-two patients were allocated to receive treatment, and 28 were allocated to receive no regional or systemic treatment. Six patients were excluded after randomization because of major protocol violations. RESULTS. The median survival time for patients was 17 months (range, 0-66), and for control subjects, the median was 8 months (range, 0-31). Log rank analysis demonstrated a significant survival benefit for treatment versus no treatment (P = 0.0039). (In two patients, early death was due to toxicity from the wrong dose of 5-FU and the wrong route of administration, respectively; the mean and median survival were reduced by 1 month). CONCLUSION. This study identified a treatment modality that prolongs survival in patients with nonresectable liver metastases and no extrahepatic metastases from colorectal cancer, suggesting that control subjects receiving no therapy may not be necessary in future randomized trials</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="514"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND. Second-line therapy of patients with colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver is unsatisfactory. One alternative to systemic treatment is therapy directed locoregionally. METHODS. Twenty-four patients with unresectable colorectal cancer with bulky liver metastases who had failed prior systemic therapy were randomized to treatment with either embolization or chemoembolization. For the embolization group, particulate transcatheter polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (150-250-microns particles) mixed with full-strength iodinated radiographic contrast was administered under direct fluoroscopic control. In patients randomized to chemoembolization, 5-fluorouracil (750 mg/m2) and recombinant alpha-2a-interferon (Roche Laboratories, Nutley, NJ) (9-MU) were thoroughly mixed into the PVA contrast suspension. Study end points were response to therapy and survival. RESULTS: Of 24 patients, 13 were randomized to chemoembolization and 11 to embolization therapy. All were assessable for toxicity, response, and complications. Among the first 13 patients treated initially, a suppurative abscess developed in one patient, who died. Eleven subsequent patients were pretreated with oral and intravenous antibiotics without further infectious complications. Five patients had hemorrhagic complications, two of which were serious. The treatment was otherwise well tolerated, with most patients experiencing transient pain, fevers, and elevations in leukocyte counts and liver enzymes, which resolved spontaneously. Computed tomography scans of the liver were used to assess patient response to therapy. There were 6 responders (25%) among the 24 patients treated. No differences in response to treatment or survival between the embolization and chemoembolization groups were noted. With a median follow-up of more than 12 months, the median survival was 9.3 months from the time of embolization therapy. CONCLUSIONS. Embolization and chemoembolization therapy appear to have antitumor activity as second-line therapy in patients with colorectal carcinoma with bulky liver metastases. Although generally well tolerated, complications of this therapy may be severe. The addition of further patients to this trial will allow a rigorous comparison of embolization alone versus embolization with chemotherapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="515"><COL><DATA> A multicenter, randomized Phase 2 study that compared patients, affected by colorectal liver metastases, who received intrahepatic arterial infusion with two different schedules of cisplatin, bolus vs. continuous infusion, and systemic 5-fluorouracil. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to validate results of a previous Phase 2 trial on bolus cisplatin intrahepatic arterial infusion, which reported a 47 percent response rate and a 32 percent 4-year survival rate for Gennari&apos;s Stage 2 patients, with a high rate of neurologic, gastrointestinal, and hematologic toxicity. METHODS: One hundred nine patients were randomized in a Phase 2 study to receive cisplatin intrahepatic arterial infusion (24 mg/m2/day, 1--&gt;5, bolus vs. continuous infusion) and systemic intravenous 5-fluorouracil (250, 375, or 500 mg/m2/day, 1--&gt;5; escalating doses, respectively, at cycles I, II, III, and VI). To avoid neurotoxicity a maximum of six cycles was administered. RESULTS: Preliminary results for the 78 evaluable patients are similar to those of the previous study: response rate 46 percent and at a median follow-up of 16.5 months, the overall survival was 16.5 months, with 45 percent of the patients who received more than 3 cycles alive at 3 years. Toxicity, evaluable in 99 patients, showed a decreased incidence of neurotoxicity and a tolerable gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity, lower in the cisplatin continuous infusion arm.

RESULTS: With a median follow-up duration of 80 months (range, 39 to 165), actuarial percentage survival figures at 7 years were compared. Relapse- free survival rates were higher for CYVADIC, 56% versus 43% (P = .007), and local recurrence was significantly reduced in the CYVADIC arm at 17% versus 31% (P = .004). In contrast, distant metastases occurred with similar frequency in both arms, 32% for CYVADIC versus 36% for control patients (P = .42), and overall survival rates were not significantly different at 63% versus 56% (P = .64).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-five patients with histologic low-grade, completely resected soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity or superficial trunk were entered onto this trial. Following resection of all gross disease, patients were randomized to the BRT arm (n = 22) or to the no-BRT arm (n = 23). On the fifth or sixth postoperative day, catheters were loaded with iridium 192 to deliver a dose of 45 Gy to the tumor bed over 4 to 6 days. RESULTS: The two groups were evenly distributed with respect to the distribution of presentation status (primary v recurrent), tumor site (trunk v extremity, proximal v distal extremity), tumor size (&lt; 5 cm v &gt; or = 5 cm), tumor depth (superficial v deep), and microscopic tumor margins (positive v negative). The predominant histopathologic diagnosis in each group was liposarcoma (BRT, 13 of 22 [59%]; no BRT, 14 of 23 [61%]) with other histopathologic subtypes evenly distributed between the two groups. The median follow-up duration among the ongoing survivors is 67 months. One patient in the BRT group developed systemic disease and died of progressive disease. Local recurrence occurred in five of 23 patients (22%) in the no-BRT group and six of 22 patients (27%) in the BRT group (P = .60). CONCLUSION: Adjuvant radiation in the form of BRT does not appear to decrease local recurrence rates following complete resection of low-grade extremity and superficial trunk soft tissue sarcomas.

The aim of this prospective randomized controlled trial was to compare the efficacy of treatment with radiolabeled oil (treated group) versus medical support (control group) in patients with stage I or II HCC (classification of Okuda) with portal vein thrombosis. METHODS: Twenty-seven HCC patients (26 males, 1 female), aged 53-79 yr, with portal vein thrombosis were randomly assigned to Lipiocis group (n = 14) or Control group (n = 13).

Resection of hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Since intensive nutritional support can reduce the catabolic response and improve protein synthesis and liver regeneration, we performed a prospective study to investigate whether perioperative nutritional support could improve outcome in patients undergoing hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS. We studied 124 patients undergoing resection of hepatocellular carcinoma. Sixty-four patients (39 with cirrhosis, 18 with chronic active hepatitis, and 7 with no associated liver disease) were randomly assigned to receive perioperative intravenous nutritional support in addition to their oral diet, and 60 patients (33 with cirrhosis, 12 with chronic active hepatitis, and 15 with no associated liver disease) were randomly assigned to a control group. The perioperative nutritional therapy consisted of a solution enriched with 35 percent branched-chain amino acids, dextrose, and lipid emulsion (50 percent medium-chain triglycerides) given intravenously for 14 days perioperatively. RESULTS. There was a reduction in the overall postoperative morbidity rate in the perioperative-nutrition group as compared with the control group (34 percent vs. 55 percent; relative risk, 0.66; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.45 to 0.96), predominantly because of fewer septic complications (17 percent vs. 37 percent; relative risk, 0.57; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.96). There were also a reduction in the requirement for diuretic agents to control ascites (25 percent vs. 50 percent; relative risk, 0.57; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.37 to 0.87), less weight loss after hepatectomy (median loss, 0 kg vs. 1.4 kg, P = 0.01), and less deterioration of liver function as measured by the change in the rate of clearance of indocyanine green (-2.8 percent vs. -4.8 percent at 20 minutes, P = 0.05). These benefits were seen predominantly in the patients with underlying cirrhosis who underwent major hepatectomy.

This randomized controlled study was objectively designed to evaluate the utility cisplatin (50 mg) in transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS. From May 1991 to July 1993, 46 patients were included in the study. All had a pathologic verification of HCC. Clinically, all of the patients were considered inoperable. However, these patients satisfied eligibility criteria for TAE. The patients were divided into two groups by random sampling. In group I, 22 patients received TAE with the regimen of cisplatin (50 mg) mixed with Lipiodol 5-15 ml followed by gelfoam pieces. In group II, 24 patients, as a controlled group, used the regimen of Lipiodol and gelfoam (Spongostan Film, Ferrosan, Denmark) pieces only, without adding any anticancer drug. The two groups were evaluated by a series of imaging studies and various clinical examinations before and after TAE. Subsequently, TAE was performed every 2 or 3 months for all patients until there was no visible tumor, or the patient could not sustain further TAE, or the patient died. RESULTS. In group I, TAE was administered 61 times (average 28 times for each patient), and in group II, 73 times (average 3 times for each patient). The 1-year and 2-year survival rates of group I were 52.5% and 26.2%, and group II were 72.5% and 39.5%. Statistically, there was no significant difference in survival curves and survival rates between these two groups. Tumor response rate of group I was 68% (15/22) and group II was 67% (16/24). There was no significant difference in tumor response between these two groups. The liver and renal function studies after TAE also showed no significant difference between these two groups.

The two groups were homogeneous according to clinical and analytical data. Survival curves in the tamoxifen-treated patients improved significantly when compared with the non-treated group (p = 0.01). Cumulative survival at the end of the first year was 48.5% in the treated patients and 9.1% in controls. Median survival was 261 days in the treated group vs. 172 in the non-treated group (p &lt; 0.05). Complications of cirrhosis and worsening of the performance status test occurred less in the treated patients than in the controls, but not significantly so.

Group A (n = 24) received lipiodolization with gelatin sponge and group B (n = 28) lipiodolization alone. Angiography after hepatic arterial chemoembolization revealed a satisfactory accumulation of lipiodol and obliteration of the microvasculature in the tumors in both groups. However, prolonged obliteration of proximal hepatic arteries was noted in 70%-80% of patients in group A, in contrast to the patency of the arteries in group B. Collateral circulation was found more frequently in group A than in group B, in which recanalization of tumor vessels and phenomenon of iodized oil &quot;wash-out&quot; were seen. There were no significant differences in therapeutic effects in patients with low risk. In those with high risk, the response rates were 28.6% and 64.2%. The half-year survival rates were 28.5% and 62.8%, 1-year survival rates 7.1% and 27.5%, and 2-year survival rates 0% and 13.7% in group A and B respectively. The differences were significant (P &lt; 0.05). Serious complications occurred more frequently in group A than in group B. The therapeutic effects of lipiodolization without gelatin sponge for patients with high risk were significantly superior to those of lipiodolization with gelatin sponge.

Median survival was 74 weeks in the tamoxifen group (range 27 to 144 weeks) and 52 weeks in the placebo group (range 4 to 112 weeks). The survival of patients treated with tamoxifen improved significantly compared to the controls (Logrank-test, p = 0.04).

Thirteen patients were given antithrombin III concentrates (1,500 IU) immediately before operation, during hepatectomy and immediately after operation. Coagulant and fibrinolytic profiles were determined by molecular markers such as thrombin-antithrombin III complex and plasmin-alpha 2plasmin inhibitor complex. During hepatic resection, both hypercoagulability and mainly primary hyperfibrinolysis occurred. Regarding the effectiveness of antithrombin III concentrates, in the antithrombin III treatment group, only a significant lower incidence of positive soluble fibrin monomer complex at postoperative days 1 and 5 was found among all the parameters studied.

In all, 192 hospitals participated, and 415 patients were enrolled in the study during the period from October 1989 through December 1990, and their data were collected. The patients were randomly allocated to group A (FARM) or group B (ADR) by a central telephone registration. Several clinical characteristics were slightly worse in group A than in group B, but there was no statistically significant difference. The actual doses of FARM and ADR were 72 mg/body and 48 mg/body, respectively. Additional treatments, including repeated TAE or surgery, were given to 248 patients. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 69% and 44% for group A and 74% and 57% for group B, respectively. The difference was marginally significant (P value in the log-rank test, 0.038). When each group of patients was classified into two subgroups, i.e., high-risk and low-risk categories, based on the severity index calculated by the Cox regression model from significant prognostic factors, the ADR subgroup was significantly superior to the FARM subgroup in the low-risk category, but there was no significant difference between the subgroups in the high-risk category. The change in the serum alpha-fetoprotein level, the extent of Lipiodol accumulation in the tumor, and the extent of tumor reduction did not show any significant difference between the groups.

A total of 58 cases of HCC were classified into 4 groups as follows: group I, PSK with 5-FU (n = 15); group II, lentinan with 5-FU (n = 15); group III, OK-432 with 5-FU (n = 12); and group IV, 5-FU alone as the control (n = 16). The mean survival time, mortality rate, time to progression, and T4/T8 ratio of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood were compared among the four groups. There was no significant difference in the background factors among the groups. In group I, the T4/T8 ratio of lymphocytes was reduced after the therapy. No significant difference was found among the groups in terms of the mean survival time, mortality rate, or time to progression. PEI for initial therapy was superior to the other therapies in terms of the mean survival time and mortality rate.

For the FARM group, the 1-year survival rate was 69.9% and the 2-year survival rate was 44.5%. For the ADR group, the corresponding survival rates were 74.7% and 44.0%. The differences among the above figures were not statistically significant. As side effects, fever, nausea, and generalized fatigue occurred at almost the same frequencies in the two groups.

Modulation of serum levels of circulating cytokines and inflammatory responses with a serine protease inhibitor was studied in 34 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE). METHODS. The 34 patients were randomly divided into two groups: 17 patients received 500 mg gabexate mesilate, a serine protease inhibitor, intravenously twice a day for 5 days after TAE, and the remaining 17 patients did not receive the drug. RESULTS. In the patients not given the drug, circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) markedly increased 1 day after TAE, reached a peak (approximately 8 times the pretreatment value) after 4 days, and remained elevated 7 days after TAE. In comparison, in the patients given the drug, circulating IL-6 was at a significantly lower level at 4 and 7 days after TAE (P &lt; 0.05, respectively). Both groups did not show significant change in circulating interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) during the week after TAE. The drug also showed a tendency to keep patient temperature below 38 degrees C, and the elevation of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration to less than 1 mg/dl after TAE (P &lt; 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS. The serum level of circulating IL-6 can be modulated by serine protease inhibitor, and this may contribute to suppressing inflammatory responses, such as fever and acute-phase protein synthesis, in the liver after TAE</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="754"><COL><DATA> The role of preoperative endoscopic drainage for patients with malignant obstructive jaundice was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. A total of 87 patients were assigned to either early elective surgery (44 patients) or endoscopic biliary drainage followed by exploration (43). Thirty-seven patients underwent successful stent insertion and 25 had effective biliary drainage. Complications related to endoscopy occurred in 12 patients. After endoscopic drainage significant reductions of hyperbilirubinaemia, indocyanine green retention and serum albumin concentration were observed. Patients with hilar lesions had a significantly higher incidence of cholangitis and failed endoscopic drainage after stent placement. The overall morbidity rate (18 patients versus 16) and mortality rate (six patients in each group) were similar in the two treatment arms irrespective of the level of biliary obstruction.

We did a randomised prospective controlled trial comparing endoscopic stent insertion and surgical biliary bypass in patients with malignant low bileduct obstruction. 204 patients were randomised (surgery 103, stent 101); 3 subsequently proved to have benign disease and were excluded, leaving 101 surgical and 100 stented patients for assessment. Technical success was achieved in 94 surgical and 95 stented patients, with functional biliary decompression obtained in 92 patients in both groups. In stented patients, there was a lower procedure-related mortality (3% vs 14%, p = 0.01), major complication rate (11% vs 29%, p = 0.02), and median total hospital stay (20 vs 26 days, p = 0.001). Recurrent jaundice occurred in 36 stented patients and 2 surgical patients. Late gastric outlet obstruction occurred in 17% of stented patients and 7% of the surgical group. Despite the early benefits of stenting there was no significant difference in overall survival between the two groups (median survival: surgical 26 weeks; stented 21 weeks; p = 0.065).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) with or without cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks for eight drug courses. All patients had received prior therapy with progestins with subsequent progression of disease. No patients had received prior therapy with cytotoxic drugs. Of 356 patients, 300 had measurable disease. RESULTS: Among 132 patients treated with doxorubicin alone, there were seven complete responses (5%), 22 partial responses (17%), 73 with stable disease (55%), and 30 with increasing disease within 2 months of study entry (23%). For the 144 patients who received the combination, there were 18 complete responses (13%), 25 partial responses (17%), 75 with stable disease (52%), and 26 with increasing disease (18%). The median progression-free interval for those patients who received doxorubicin alone was 3.2 months, while it was 3.9 months for those who received the combination. The median survival duration for doxorubicin patients was 6.7 months, while it was 7.3 months for the combination patients. None of the unadjusted estimates of treatment differences are statistically significant. Prognostic features that had an impact on outcome included one factor associated with an increased likelihood of response (presence of measurable lung metastases) and four features associated with a poorer survival (poor performance status [PS] of 2 or 3, high pathologic grade, and presence of liver metastases or other intraabdominal disease). If these features are taken into account in multivariate analyses, there is no statistically significant evidence for differences in response rates (relative odds of response, 1.58; P = .06, one-tailed test), and survival duration is slightly longer in the combination regimen (17% reduction in death rate; P = .048). CONCLUSION: The combination of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide thus appears to offer a small advantage over doxorubicin alone in the management of endometrial carcinoma at the expense of more frequent and severe myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="826"><COL><DATA> 60 patients were entered into a randomised study comparing vindesine (3 mg/m2/week) plus interferon-alpha 2b (6 U/m2 3 times per week) to vindesine alone or to interferon alone for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma.

In addition, patients receiving the combined treatment schedule had a significantly prolonged survival (median 19 months) when compared to a median of 10 months for interferon alone and 5 months for vindesine alone.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred forty-eight patients with completely resected melanoma of Breslow&apos;s thickness greater than 0.75 mm and clinically negative lymph nodes were randomized to oral vitamin A (100,000 IU/d) for 18 months or to observation. Patients were stratified by Breslow&apos;s thickness of primary lesion (0.76 to 1.50 mm, 1.51 to 3.00 mm, or &gt; 3.00 mm), sex, and type of therapy (excision, excision plus node dissection, excision plus perfusion, or excision plus both). The median duration of follow-up observation of living patients is greater than 8 years. The relative risk (RR) in disease-free survival and overall survival in the treatment compared with the observation group was calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Overall, there was no difference in disease-free survival or overall survival between the two groups. Examination of treatment by stratification interactions and subset analysis did not show any treatment-effect differences based on sex or type of therapy. There was also no difference between groups in disease-free survival based on Breslow&apos;s thickness of the primary lesion. Overall, 12% of patients who received vitamin A experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicities.

In an attempt to confirm this hypothesis, a randomized study was performed with the further intent of observing whether low doses of recombinant interferon alfa-2a (rIFN alpha 2a) could be as effective as intermediate doses. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred sixty-six patients were randomized onto three different treatment arms: DTIC 800 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) days 1 and 21; DTIC plus rIFN alpha 2a 9 mIU intramuscularly (IM) daily; and DTIC plus rIFN alpha 2a 3 mIU IM three times per week. Major prognostic factors were well balanced among the three arms. Chemotherapy was administered for a maximum of eight cycles. After 6 months of therapy, rIFN alpha 2a was continued until disease progression at 3 mIU three times per week in responding patients who had received the combined treatment. RESULTS: The percentage of objective responses did not differ among the three groups (20%, 28%, and 23%, respectively), although a significant prolongation of response duration was observed when rIFN alpha 2a was added to DTIC (2.6 v 8.4 v 5.5 months, respectively). However, this improvement in response duration did not translate into an amelioration of overall survival. The addition of rIFN alpha 2a led to the onset of flu-like syndrome, but in no case was it necessary to withdraw the treatment program and no toxic deaths or life-threatening toxicities were reported. CONCLUSION: In this study, rIFN alpha 2a significantly prolonged response duration, whereas no effects on response rate and survival were observed; rIFN alpha 2a 3 mIU appeared to be equally effective and better tolerated than 9 mIU</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="829"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To perform a double-blind randomized trial with American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) stage III melanoma patients for the following reasons: (1) to confirm our previous finding that patients with antibodies against the melanoma differentiation antigen GM2 have an improved prognosis, and (2) to demonstrate clinical benefit from GM2 antibody induction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-two patients with AJCC stage III melanoma who were free of disease after surgery were randomized: 58 to receive treatment with the GM2/BCG vaccine, and 64 to receive treatment with bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) alone. All patients were pretreated with low-dose cyclophosphamide (Cy). RESULTS: GM2 antibody was detected in 50 of 58 patients treated with GM2/BCG and seven of 64 patients treated with BCG alone. With a minimum follow-up period of 51 months, there was a highly significant increase in the disease-free interval (P = .004) and a 17% increase in overall survival (P = .02) in these 57 antibody-positive patients, confirming our earlier experience. Exclusion of all patients with preexisting GM2 antibodies (one in the GM2/BCG group and five in the BCG group) from statistical analysis resulted in a 23% increase in disease-free interval (P = .02) and a 14% increase in overall survival (P = .15) at 51 months for patients treated with the GM2/BCG vaccine. However, when all patients in the two treatment groups were compared as randomized, these increases were 18% for disease-free interval and 11% for survival in the GM2/BCG treatment group, with neither result showing statistical significance. CONCLUSION: (1) Vaccination with GM2/BCG induced immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in most patients. (2) GM2 antibody production was associated with a prolonged disease-free interval and survival. (3) Comparison of the two arms of this trial as randomized fails to show a statistically significant improvement in disease-free interval or survival for patients treated with GM2/BCG vaccines</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="830"><COL><DATA> Both coumarin (1,2-benzopyrone) and warfarin (4-hydroxycoumarin) have been shown to prevent the recurrence of malignant melanoma.

In 30 perfusions blood samples were obtained at defined times: plasma hemoglobin (Hb), serum lactate dehydrogenase (s-LDH), number of erythrocytes, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), hemoglobin and bilirubin were determined for hemolysis, leukocyte count (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes) and platelets as a check for cellular damage, and PO2, PCO2, O2 saturation and pH to define blood oxygenation and CO2 elimination. Maximal increase in temperature after 30 min and perfusion time until maximum tissue temperature were also recorded. The membrane oxygenator yielded better results from the aspect of hemolysis: s-LDH and plasma Hb were significantly different (p &lt; 0.001). Cellular damage was less with the membrane oxygenator: platelet differences were significant (p &lt; 0.01). Oxygenation and hyperthermia were obtained more quickly and were better controllable in membrane oxygenator. Further advantages for the patient were the smaller volume of blood needed for priming in a membrane oxygenator (750 vs. 1,200 ml) and improved safety resulting from a &apos;closed&apos; perfusion system.

We report the results of a prospective randomized comparison of the two combinations in previously untreated patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty assessable patients were entered onto the trial; 52 received FAM and 85 PELF. A 1:2 unbalanced randomization in favor of the experimental treatment was chosen. Approximately 90% of patients had measurable tumor masses. RESULTS: The overall response rates (complete responses [CRs] and partial responses [PRs]) were 15% and 43% for the FAM and the PELF regimens, respectively, with a statistically significant advantage for the experimental treatment (P = .001). Time to progression (median, 2.6 and 4.7 months), duration of response (median, 10.7 and 10.2 months), and survival durations (median, 5.6 and 8.1 months) were not significantly different between the FAM and PELF regimens, respectively. The PELF combination was more toxic compared with FAM, but generally tolerable. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the PELF combination is about three times more effective than the FAM combination in inducing objective responses. Due to tolerability, it is not recommended for routine clinical use.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The overall survival in patients with gastric cancer is disappointing. Improved survival has been reported by Japanese authors. Whether this is because of a higher number of early gastric cancers in the Japanese series, different biologic behavior in Asians, or the adoption of radical surgery with lymphadenectomy remains unclear. METHODS: R1 subtotal gastrectomy with omentectomy and R3 total gastrectomy (omentectomy, splenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, lymphatic clearance of the celiac axis, and skeletonization of vessels in the porta hepatis) were evaluated in a prospective, randomized comparison. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were randomized--25 to the R1 group and 30 to the R3 group. The two groups were comparable for age, sex, tumor size, TNM stage, and length of follow-up. The R3 group had a longer operating time (140 vs. 260 min; p &lt; 0.05), a greater transfusion requirement (0 vs. 2 units, p &lt; 0.05) and a longer hospital stay (8 vs. 16 days; p &lt; 0.05) (medians; Mann-Whitney U test). The only postoperative death was in the R3 group and was caused by intra-abdominal sepsis. Fourteen patients in the R3 group developed left subphrenic abscesses. There were no major complications in the R1 group. Overall survival was significantly better in the R1 group (median survival estimated by Kaplan-Meier method, 1511 vs. 922 days, p &lt; 0.05, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: R3 total gastrectomy can be performed with a low mortality, but it has a high morbidity because of intra-abdominal sepsis.

In order to estimate the effectiveness of preoperative intensive radiation and radiation with local microwave hyperthermia in radical gastric cancer treatment, 293 patients were randomized into three respective treatment groups: surgery alone, surgery preceded by preoperative radiation; and surgery followed by preoperative radiation and hyperthermia. Preoperative radiation therapy to a total dose of 20 Gy in four 5 Gy fractions did not improve 3- or 5-year survival in gastric cancer patients in comparison with surgery alone. Local hyperthermia in combination with radiation therapy followed by surgery produced a significant improvement in 3-year survival of 22.1% (from 35.5 +/- 4.9% to 57.6 +/- 6.3%, P &lt; 0.05) and 5-year survival of 21.3% (from 30.1 +/- 4.7 to 51.4 +/- 6.6%, P &lt; 0.05). In unresectable gastric cancer patients, radiation therapy and radiation therapy with hyperthermia both increase mean survival. In conclusion; intensive preoperative radiation therapy in total dose 20 Gy plus local microwave hyperthermia significantly improved 3- and 5-year survival in comparison with surgery alone.

Continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion (CHPP) with a solution that contained 10 micrograms/ml mitomycin C was devised initially as a method for intraperitoneal thermochemotherapy. The authors conducted a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of CHPP as a prophylactic treatment for prevention of peritoneal recurrence of gastric cancer with serosal invasion. METHODS. Between January 1983 and October 1986, 82 patients with gross serosal invasion but no gross peritoneal metastasis were divided by random sampling into two groups before undergoing potentially curative surgery for gastric cancer: 42 patients were scheduled to receive CHPP, whereas 40 were not scheduled to receive this treatment. CHPP was administered immediately after closing the abdomen after gastric resections while the patients were still on the operating table under general anesthesia. RESULTS. The 5-year survival rate (64.2%) of patients in the CHPP group was higher than that (52.5%) of patients in the control group although the difference was not significant. Of several patterns of cancer recurrence, peritoneal recurrence was more frequent in the control group than in the CHPP group. The mortality rate from peritoneal recurrence in the case of patients in the CHPP group was much lower than that of patients in the control group (P = 0.0854). CHPP did not induce anastomotic breakdown or chemical peritonitis after surgery. CONCLUSIONS. The results indicate that CHPP is effective in preventing peritoneal recurrence of gastric cancer with serosal invasion, which is highly likely to reappear in the peritoneum</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="974"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: The long-term survival probability of patients who undergo surgery for stage 3 and 4 gastric cancer is poor, predominantly due to metastatic spread of the tumor. Depending on the type of tumor histology, the pathway of metastases is mainly peritoneal or hepatic dissemination. Interruption of this mechanism may be possible by intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective randomized trial of 67 patients undergoing surgery for stage 3 and 4 gastric cancer, 33 patients underwent adjuvant postoperative IPT with cisplatin, while 34 control subjects remained untreated. RESULTS: Patients in the treatment group received a median of four IPT perfusions. Apart from frequent nausea, no adverse reactions or complications were noted. The median disease-free survival durations were 12.7 months and 9.7 months in treated patients and controls, respectively (P = .8). After a median follow-up duration of 72 months, 54 patients (80%) had died of primary disease or related complications. The median survival duration for IPT patients was 17.3 months as compared with 16.0 months for controls (P = .6). Autopsies were performed on 12 (18%) of 54 patients who died, and showed tumor spread to the peritoneal cavity and/or to the liver, irrespective of the application of IPT. CONCLUSION: IPT with cisplatin monotherapy does not improve survival probability after surgery for stage 3 and 4 gastric cancer. The reasons for ineffectiveness of IPT may be the choice of an unsuitable chemotherapeutic agent, an inefficient modus of application, or a lack of sufficient drug penetration into the serosa or peritoneal metastasis</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1033"><COL><DATA> An Italian prospective multicentre study evaluated the efficacy of octreotide, a synthetic somatostatin analogue, in preventing the complications of elective pancreatic surgery. 303 patients with tumours of the pancreas or the ampullary region, in whom ultrasonography and computed tomography scan had shown a resectable lesion, or with chronic pancreatitis, were randomized in a double-blind fashion to treatment with octreotide 100 micrograms t.i.d. s.c. starting at least 1 h before surgery and continued till the 7th postsurgical day, or with matching placebo. Unresectable lesions were found at laparatomy in 31 patients (15% of those with tumours). In 14 others, procedures not anticipated in the study protocol had to be performed, and in 6 additional cases there were other protocol violations so that these 20 patients were excluded from the study analysis. Considering the 252 evaluable patients, the complication rate was significantly higher in the 130 placebo-treated patients than in the 122 who received octreotide (29.2 vs. 15.6%; p = 0.01).

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies have suggested a benefit to perioperative nutritional support for patients undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery. METHODS: A prospective, randomized study was conducted using patients who had undergone a major pancreatic resection with randomization on postoperative day one to either receive or not receive adjuvant total parenteral nutrition. RESULTS: No benefit could be demonstrated by the use of adjuvant parenteral nutrition in this setting. Complications were significantly greater in the group receiving total parenteral nutrition. These complications tended to be those associated with infection. CONCLUSIONS: Routine applications of postoperative parenteral nutrition to patients undergoing major pancreatic resection for malignancy cannot be recommended. Further studies are required to determine the reason that infectious complications in these patients are increased</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1094"><COL><DATA> </DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1095"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Isolated regional perfusion (IRP) of an extremity is a major operation. The therapeutic value for stage I melanoma is still controversial and is presently being investigated in a prospective, randomized study by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer. So far there are no reliable data available concerning the morbidity of IRP. Therefore, we performed a prospective, randomized study on this topic. METHODS: In a prospective study, a group of 97 patients with a stage I melanoma localized on an arm or leg were randomized for IRP with melphalan followed by wide excision (WE) and fasciotomy or for WE only. Morbidity was evaluated on the basis of the following parameters: duration of hospitalization, postoperative pain, postoperative performance, and grade of perfusion toxicity. At 12- month follow-up, a physical diagnostic examination was performed to measure the mobility of the joints, and the circumference and volume of the treated and untreated extremities. RESULTS: All the parameters, including the physical diagnostic examination, could be evaluated in 83 of the 97 patients (8 patients died of metastatic disease and 1 patient died of another disease before they could be investigated; 2 patients were in too poor physical condition due to metastases to be examined, and 3 patients were unable to participate for nonmedical reasons). Age and sex distribution were comparable in the various patient groups. Treatment mortality was 0%. There were no complications except for urine retention (one patient) and wound dehiscence (one patient). After IRP + WE of the lower limb, the period of hospitalization was an average of 1.9 days longer (p = 0.01) than for WE on the limb only. This difference was absent for the arm. Naturally after perfusion, there was a significant difference in toxic reactions (edema and pain) between the IRP + WE patients and the WE-only patients. However, at 12- month follow-up, the difference in morbidity between IRP + WE and WE- only patients was no longer present: Morbidity of joints and circumference of the limb were the same. A number of subjective complaints were encountered fairly often after IRP + WE (e.g., pricking sensations or pain during changes in the weather), which can possibly be explained by fibrosis caused by perfusion. These complaints were not quantified further because they did not hinder the patients&apos; functioning. CONCLUSIONS: In a long term, IRP with fasciotomy does not cause any additional morbidity. Immediately after the operation, there was more morbidity as a result of the perfusion, which caused a 2-day- longer period of hospitalization in the patients with lower-limb perfusion compared with those who underwent WE only. These findings are in contrast to those in the literature, in which 25% limitation of motion in the ankle joint after perfusion is mentioned. One explanation may be that we always performed fasciotomy after perfusion to prevent (sub)clinical compression syndrome and avoid late fibrosis</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1125"><COL><DATA> Between August 1990 and January 1992, 184 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, FIGO stage IIB-IVA, were randomized to receive either two cycles of bleomycin, ifosfamide-mesna, and cis-platinum (BIP) chemotherapy (CT) followed by radiotherapy (RT) (&quot;CT-RT group,&quot; n = 94) or RT alone (RT group, n = 90). In the CT-RT group, of 89 evaluable patients, 64 responded: complete response (CR) 4 (4.5%) and partial response 60 (67.5%). Of the remaining 25 patients, 23 had stable disease and 2 progressed. Eighty of 89 patients completed RT as planned. Following RT 56 (70%) achieved CR, 19 (23.7%) had residual disease, and 5 (6.3%) had progressed. CT responders had a better response to RT: 83% (49/59) vs 33.3% (7/21), P &lt; 0.01). The stage of disease, histologic grade, duration of symptoms, and history of smoking had no influence on the response to CT. Patients aged &gt; 45 years and those with Hb &gt; 10 g/dl had significantly better response. Nausea/vomiting, alopecia, grade I-II myelosuppression, diarrhea, and mucositis were the major side effects of CT. Two patients died of CT toxicity. In the RT group, 88 patients were evaluable: 61 (69.3%) patients achieved CR, 25 had residual disease, and 2 progressed. The side effects of RT were cystitis, proctitis, and local skin reaction. These were equally distributed between the two groups. There was no significant difference in overall and disease-free survival in the two groups.

RT consisted of external RT (40 Gy fractionated over 4 weeks)+brachy-therapy (40 Gy to point A)+an additional boost to the parameters (15-20 Gy) in arm RT; CT consisted of cisplatin 60 mg/m2 i.v. day 1 q 15 days administered for 2 cycles before the start of RT and for 4 cycles after the end of radiation treatment in CT+RT arm. Among the 58 evaluable patients objective response rate was as follows: in RT arm, CR in 40.7% of patients, PR in 40.7%, and SD in 18.6%; in CT+RT arm, CR in 42% of patients, PR in 35.5%, and SD in 22.5%. The median duration of response was 12 months (range: 3-38 + months). At a median follow-up of 36 months survival (S) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 83% and 72.4% in RT arm, 72% and 59.3% in CT+RT arm, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the 2 treatment arms, neither in terms of objective response nor in terms of S and PFS. Both treatments were generally well tolerated. In our experience the addition of chemotherapy to standard radiotherapy does not enhance morbidity and does not interfere with the correct delivery of the planned treatment. However, results of this combined modality regimen remain unsatisfactory, since no improvement in pelvic control and survival of patients with advanced cervical carcinoma was observed</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1127"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: This study is a prospective randomized clinical trial undertaken at our center to compare low dose rate versus high dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy for the treatment of carcinoma uterine cervix. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From June 1986 to June 1989, 482 patients with previously untreated invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix were entered into the study. After an initial clinical examination and investigative work-up the patients were staged according to FIGO staging system. Depending upon the stage of the disease, the size of the local growth and the local cervical anatomy, the patients were divided into two main groups. In group I patients, the predominant treatment was by intracavitary therapy and in group II patients, the predominant therapy was by external beam radiation. In both the groups at the time of intracavity brachytherapy the patients were alternately randomized to receive either low dose rate or high dose rate brachytherapy. There were thus two hundred forty-six patients in the low dose rate group and two hundred thirty-six patients in the high dose rate group. The patients were analyzed for local control, 5 years survival and late radiation morbidity. RESULTS: Stage for stage the local control rates in the low dose rate group and high dose rate group were similar. The overall local control achieved in the low dose rate group was 79.7% as compared to 75.8% in the high dose rate group. The 5 years survival figures in the low dose rate and high dose rate group were also comparable. In Stage I, it was 73% for low dose rate patients and 78% for high dose rate patients, for Stage II it was 62% and 64% respectively and for Stage III patients it was 50% and 43%. The only statistically significant difference was found in the incidence of overall rectal complications which was 19.9% for the low dose rate group as compared to only 6.4% for the high dose rate group. However, the more severe grade 3-4 complications were not significantly different between the two groups (2.4% vs. 0.4%, respectively). The bladder morbidity in both the groups was similar. CONCLUSION: Thus high dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy is an equally good alternative to conventional low dose rate brachytherapy in the treatment of carcinoma of the uterine cervix</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1196"><COL><DATA> Major pancreatic resection still carries a considerable risk for morbidity and even mortality. Complications occurring after pancreatic surgery are chiefly linked with exocrine pancreatic secretion. Therefore to inhibit exocrine pancreatic secretion perioperatively seems to be a promising concept in the prevention of complications following pancreatic resection. The hormone somatostatin and its synthetic analogue octreotide have been demonstrated to inhibit exocrine pancreatic secretion profoundly, particularly the secretion of proteases is decreased. In a randomized placebo-controlled multicentric and double-blind trial we analyzed the role of octreotide in the prevention of post-operative complications after major pancreatic surgery. A significant reduction of complications (fistula, abscess, fluid collection, sepsis, pulmonary insufficiency, postoperative acute pancreatitis) could be demonstrated in patients receiving octreotide (3 x 100 micrograms/day s.c.). The effect of octreotide was particularly true in patients undergoing a Whipple resection for cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="5"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Mid-gut carcinoid tumours often present with liver metastases, and survival has then been less than 2 years in earlier reports. We have evaluated the effects of interferon therapy on clinical response and survival, with or without hepatic artery embolization in these patients. METHODS: In a prospective study 30 female and 12 male patients, aged 23 to 75 years, with mid-gut carcinoid tumours and liver metastases underwent surgery with removal of as much as possible of their primary tumour. If technically feasible, embolization of hepatic arteries was performed in the absence of contraindications. Seventeen patients were embolized, and all patients received interferon-alpha 2b treatment for 1 year. Response factors were computer tomography (CT) measurement of the largest liver metastasis and the 24-h urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). After 12 months patients with objective response or stable disease either continued or withdrew from interferon therapy. Survival was estimated when all patients had been observed for at least 36 months. RESULTS: Nine patients reduced the dose, and five withdrew from interferon treatment owing to side-effects the 1st year. Three patients died. Fifteen patients (39%) showed objective response 12 months after inclusion. Cumulative 5-year survival estimated from inclusion was 37.5% in all 42 patients but 71.4% in those who continued interferon therapy. The difference in survival between the interferon-treated and those who withdrew from interferon therapy at 12 months was significant when embolization was corrected for in a Cox model (p &lt; 0.0125). The seemingly increased survival in embolized versus non-embolized patients did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Interferon induced an objective response in mid-gut carcinoid patients as judged by the 24-h urinary 5-HIAA excretion. Patients receiving continuous interferon therapy showed improved response and survival compared with patients who stopped the treatment. Regardless of medical therapy, more survivors and more responders, as evaluated from CT measurements, were found among the embolized patients than among the non-embolized. Embolization could, however, not be shown to have a significant effect on survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="32"><COL><DATA> A prospective randomized study was conducted to try to answer two questions: is a loading dose of medroxyprogesterone acetate (1000 mg p.o. q.d.s. for 48 h) superior to conventional dosing; and does an oral maintenance dose of 1000 mg daily offer any advantage over 500 mg daily in women with advanced breast cancer who have failed to respond to, or have relapsed after, tamoxifen? Of 211 patients randomized, 207 were evaluable. There was no improvement in response rates, time to response, response duration or overall survival as a result of the loading dose. When comparing high and low maintenance doses, there was a significant difference in response rates (48% versus 32%; chi 2 = 10.09, df = 2, P = 0.006) and survival (66% versus 41% alive at 12 months; chi 2 = 9.06, df = 1, P = 0.003) in favour of the higher dose regimen, although there was no significant difference in the duration of response. There was no additional toxicity attributable to the loading dose regimen, but side effects were more frequent with the high dose maintenance schedule (141 of 201 adverse effects occurring in these two groups) although the incidence of severe toxicity was similar with both high dose and low dose treatments</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="33"><COL><DATA> This randomized study was designed to compare the efficacy and toxicity of MMV chemotherapy (mitomycin C(MMC), methotrexate (MTX) and vincristine(VCR)), MMVM (MMV+medroxyprogesterone acetate(MPA)) and MMVP (MMV+prednisolone(P)), and to evaluate potential additional effects of MPA or P to the chemotherapy in doxorubicin (ADR)-refractory cancer patients. A total of 108 advanced breast cancer patients who had been resistant to ADR or who had relapsed after response were randomized to the three treatment arms: MMC 4mg/m2, MTX 35mg/m2 and VCR 0.7mg/m2, i.v., on days 1 and 8; repeated every 3 weeks. MPA 1,200 mg/day or P 10mg/day was given orally in the MMVM and MMVP arms, respectively. An interim analysis showed that the response to MMV was marginally significantly lower than the other groups; entry to the arm was thus interrupted. 102 patients were evaluable. Totally, response rates of 9.5%(2/21) in MMV, 37.5%(15/40) in MMVM and 29.2%(12/41) in MMVP were obtained. There was a significant difference in the response between the MMVM and MMV arms (p = 0.0206), and a marginal difference between MMVP and MMV (p = 0.0784). Although overall survivals in the 3 groups were equivalent, the time to progression of patients treated with MMVM and MMVP was shown to be significantly longer than MMV patients. Hematological adverse effects, especially thrombocytopenia, were significantly diminished by the addition of hormones, particularly MPA, to the chemotherapy, thus increasing total doses of chemotherapeutic agents. It was shown that in ADR-resistant cancers MMVM had an effect equivalent to that in ADR-sensitive breast cancers. The authors conclude that MMVM may be a candidate for a noncross resistant regimen for ADR-resistant cancers, as well as an effective 2nd line chemoendocrine treatment of advanced breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="34"><COL><DATA> A prospective randomized study was made of 270 patients with unilateral stage I or II invasive breast cancer treated by segmental resection, axillary dissection and radiation at the University Hospital of Tampere, Finland, between 1989 and 1991.

The medial and lateral two-field technique was used and the target volumes were determined randomly either to include the internal mammary chain (IMC-RT) or not (no-IMC-RT). The prevalence of radiation pneumonitis was 16% and there was no significant difference between the IMC- and no-IMC-groups (18 vs. 14%). Skin reactions were equal in both groups. Lung fibrosis was more common in the IMC-RT group. In conclusion: radiation of internal mammary chain after conservative surgery does not lead to an increase in clinically important skin or pulmonary complications.

DESIGN--A prospective randomized study was carried out to compare the effectiveness of four courses of doxorubicin hydrochloride followed by eight courses of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) (sequential regimen) vs two courses of CMF alternated with one course of doxorubicin for a total of 12 courses (alternating regimen). All drug courses were recycled every 3 weeks. The median duration of follow-up at the time of current analysis was 9 years. SETTING--The study was conducted on patients operated on for primary unilateral breast cancer at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan, Italy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was delivered in the outpatient clinic of the Division of Medical Oncology. PATIENTS--A total of 405 women were entered into the study, 403 of whom met the protocol criteria. Patient characteristics were fairly well balanced between the two treatment groups, with the exception of extent of nodal involvement: 38% with more than 10 positive nodes were randomized to the alternating regimen compared with 29% in the sequential regimen (P = .08). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Relapse-free and total survival at 10 years after surgery estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. RESULTS--Treatment outcome was significantly superior for patients who received the sequential regimen compared with those given the alternating chemotherapy. The relapse-free survival was 42% vs 28% (P = .002) and total survival was 58% vs 44% (P = .002), respectively. The benefit of the sequential regimen was evident in all patient subsets. Treatment was fairly well tolerated, but we documented four cases of congestive heart failure, which was fatal in two patients.

The six-cycle ACMF group (93 patients) received, intravenously (i.v.), 130 mg/m2 CPA, 26 mg/m2 MTX, and 600 mg/m2 5FU on days 1 and 8, and 26 mg/m2 ADM on day 1 of each cycle.

These treatments were repeated every 4 weeks, and all the patients took tamoxifen (30 mg/day) for 2 years. The background factors of the two groups were comparable. There were non-significant trends toward better disease-free and overall survival rates in the high-dose, six-cycle ACMF group. Both treatments were well tolerated, but more patients in the low-dose, 12 cycle group refused to continue to receive chemotherapy.

Efficacy end points included time to disease progression (TDP), time to treatment failure (TTF), survival, tumor response rates, and quality of life (QL) and relief of cancer-related symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between August 24, 1990, and December 1, 1992, 183 patients were randomized (2:1) to treatment with NVB (30 mg/m2 weekly) or ALK (25 mg/m2 every 4 weeks) i.v. Patients were stratified by measurable or nonmeasurable-assessable disease and by treatment center. RESULTS: Time to disease progression was significantly longer with NVB than with ALK, with a median 12 weeks versus 8 weeks, respectively (P &lt; .001). NVB patients also had significantly longer time to treatment failure than ALK patients, with a median 12 weeks versus 8 weeks, respectively (P &lt; .001). The effect of NVB on survival was also statistically significant (P = .034): 1-year survival rates were 35.7% with NVB and 21.7% with ALK and the median survival rate was 35 weeks and 31 weeks, respectively. In total, 46.5% of NVB patients and 28.2% of ALK patients achieved an objective response or stabilization of disease (P = .06). No intergroup differences were noted in patient-assessed QL and cancer-related symptoms. The most common toxicities were hematologic, including granulocytopenia with NVB and thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia with ALK. Both drugs were generally well tolerated, and no septic deaths were reported. CONCLUSION: This randomized trial demonstrates a survival benefit in anthracycline-refractory ABC. NVB was well tolerated and demonstrated activity superior to ALK in anthracycline-refractory ABC, without compromising QL. Based on activity of single-agent NVB in this difficult-to-treat patient population, investigations of NVB in combination with other anticancer drugs are warranted</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="111"><COL><DATA> This prospective randomized trial compared an iridium-192 implant boost with a cobalt-60 external irradiation boost to the primary tumor site, in 255 patients with breast cancers 3-7 cm in diameter.

Patients with clinically positive axillary nodes also received a cobalt-60 10-15 Gy boost to the inferior axilla. All patients had core biopsy only.

All drugs were administered iv. on day 1 and recycled on day 21. In 141 evaluable patients the response rate (CR+PR) was better in the FEC (43.6%) than in the FNC regimen (30.3%) (95% C.I. of 32% to 55% versus 14% to 34%), without any statistically significant difference. Differences in response rate were significantly in favour of FEC group in previously untreated patients (57.6% versus 25%, p = .02), and in postmenopausal women (46.1% versus 23.6%, p = .01). No significant differences between the two treatment arms were observed in terms of either time to progression or duration of response and survival. The most important dose-limiting toxicity was hematological (leuko-and thrombocytopenia were significantly higher in FNC-treated patients). This difference in hematological toxicity sustained a significantly different incidence of delays in administering chemotherapy courses, which precluded the administration of comparable doses of all drugs in both groups. The incidence of complete alopecia was significantly higher in FEC-treated patients, while no clinical or instrumental evidence of CHF was observed with either regimen.

Patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, which could not have included anthracyclines, had to have relapsed at least 12 months after the completion of therapy. There were no statistically significant differences in pretreatment characteristics or metastatic disease location between the two groups. Ninety-four patients were assessable for response. No differences were observed in response rate or in survival between the groups. The response rate (complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)) was 68% (13% CR and 55% PR for CAF; 0% CR and 68% PR for CNF). Median survival for all patients was 19 months (18 months with CAF and 19 months with CNF). All patients were assessable for toxicity. There were no differences in gastrointestinal and cardiac toxicity. More grade I-II hematologic toxicity episodes (p &lt; 0.001) and treatment delays (p = 0.05) due to leucopenia were observed with the CNF group, and more grade III alopecia (p &lt; 0.001) was observed with the CAF group. Patients received further therapeutic manoeuvres after finishing the study with a sequential treatment consisting of hormonal therapy and chemotherapy with mitomycin (M) -vinblastine (Vbl) (M 10 mg/m2 day 1, Vbl 5 mg/m2 days 1, 15 and 29; maximum 5 cycles). This chemotherapy treatment was received by 32 patients, with a response rate of 34% and grade III-IV hematologic toxicity of 37%. Treatment with CNF can be considered a good alternative to CAF for first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer. M-Vbl treatment is useful as second-line treatment in patients with prior adriamycin exposure</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="114"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To evaluate in a randomized clinical trial systemic chemoendocrine therapy used as primary (neo-adjuvant) treatment before surgery in women with primary operable breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients aged less than 70 years with clinically palpable, primary operable breast cancer diagnostically confirmed by fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and suitable for treatment with surgery, radiotherapy, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and tamoxifen were considered eligible. Patients randomized to neoadjuvant treatment received four cycles of chemo-therapy for 3 months before surgery followed by another four cycles after surgery, and were compared with patients randomized to adjuvant therapy who received eight cycles of chemotherapy over 6 months after surgery. RESULTS: Of 212 patients who were randomized to receive either adjuvant (n = 107) or neoadjuvant (n = 105) chemoendocrine therapy, 200 are now assessable for response. The two groups are comparable for age, menopausal status, disease stage, and surgical requirements. The overall clinical response rate was 85%, with a complete histologic response rate of 10%. There was a significant reduction in the requirement for mastectomy in patients who received neoadjuvant treatment (13%) as compared with those who received adjuvant therapy (28%) (P &lt; .005). Symptomatic and hematologic acute toxicity was low and similar for adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy. The median follow-up period for patients in this trial is 28 months, during which time four patients have relapsed locally and 20, including one of the local relapses, have developed metastatic disease, 19 of whom have died. The follow-up period is too brief to evaluate relapse rate or survival duration. CONCLUSION: This trial confirms previous reports of a high rate of response to neoadjuvant therapy, but is the first to include small primary cancers and to show, in the context of a randomized trial, a reduction in the requirement for mastectomy. Until disease-free and overall survival data are available from the larger National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP)-18 trial, such neoadjuvant treatment cannot be recommended outside of a clinical trial</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="115"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To investigate whether treatment with prolonged low-dose adjuvant chemotherapy could improve survival of patients with axillary node-positive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred fifty-two patients with axillary node-positive breast cancer who received postoperative irradiation were prospectively randomized in a trial (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC] 09771) that compared surgery followed by prolonged low-dose chemotherapy versus surgery alone. Chemotherapy was given for a period of 2 years and consisted of monthly courses of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/m2 orally on days 1 to 14, methotrexate 15 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8, and fluorouracil 350 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8 (CMF). RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 10 years, the overall survival duration was significantly prolonged in the chemotherapy arm (hazards ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 0.99; P = .04). Ten-year overall survival rates (+/- SE) were 59% (+/- 3.6%) for the chemotherapy arm and 50% (+/- 3.7%) for the control arm. Time to local relapse was significantly prolonged in the chemotherapy arm (hazards ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.42 to 0.94; P = .02). Patients with one to three positive axillary nodes and patients with estrogen receptor-negative tumors especially benefited from chemotherapy. Toxicity was observed in 93% of patients. CONCLUSION: We conclude that prolonged low-dose adjuvant CMF can significantly prolong overall survival in patients with node-positive breast cancer. However, considering the fact that toxicity was still considerable despite reducing the dose of chemotherapy by 50%, we believe that conventionally dosed short-term regimens are preferable in the treatment of node-positive breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="171"><COL><DATA> From January 1988 to June 1992, 66 patients with resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus underwent preoperative adjuvant therapy. These patients were prospectively divided into two treatment groups; 32 were treated with radiofrequency wave local hyperthermia combined with chemoradiotherapy (hyperthermochemoradiotherapy; HCR), while the remaining 34 patients were treated with chemoradiotherapy alone (CR). There were no procedural complications in either group and the postoperative mortality was zero. In the HCR group, no viable cancer cells were found within the entire 5 mm-width slices of the resected specimen in eight patients (25%), while only two (5.9%) in the CR group (P &lt; 0.05) demonstrate no viable cancer cells. The cumulative 3-year survival rate was 50.4% in the HCR group and 24.2% in the CR group.

A group of 33 patients received postoperative radiation therapy and were compared to a control group of 35 patients treated by surgery alone. No statistically significant differences were noted between the two treatment groups concerning overall and disease-free survival rates. Postoperative irradiation significantly increased the incidence of fibrotic strictures of the esophagogastric or esophagocolonic anastomoses and caused a delayed recovery of patients quality of life. Based on these results, we believe that postoperative radiation therapy alone cannot be advocated as a adjuvant therapy following curative resection of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="173"><COL><DATA> We investigated the effect of multimodal therapy in 187 patients with esophageal cancer. All patients were followed up over a period of 5 years. Among the 187 patients, 174 (93.1%) eligible patients with biopsy-proved esophageal squamous cell carcinoma underwent esophagectomy and were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy (RT) with or without protein-bound polysaccharide (PSK), or RT plus chemotherapy (CT) with or without PSK. The 5-year survival rates of patients with RT, RT+PSK, RT+CT and RT+CT+PSK were 40.0%, 42.3%, 29.1% and 37.2%, respectively. There was a tendency for longer survival on PSK, but statistical significance was not reached (RT+CT group versus RT+CT+PSK group: log-rank and generalized Wilcoxon tests, P = .1930, P = .1034). However, Cox multivariate regression analysis indicated that postoperative therapy with or without PSK was the most significant prognostic factor for patients receiving RT+CT and for the eligible patients. These results indicate that PSK may have a beneficial effect on esophageal carcinoma when given in combination with CT+RT</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="226"><COL><DATA> Patients who underwent potential curative surgery for colonic adenocarcinoma were enrolled in a prospectively randomised, controlled clinical trial of combined intraperitoneal (i.p.) plus systemic intravenous (i.v.) chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV). We investigated whether this adjuvant treatment approach, specifically addressing the risk of peritoneal and hepatic recurrence, could improve disease-free and overall survival. Between May 1988 and December 1990, 121 patients with resected stage III or high-risk stage II (T4N0M0) colon cancer were randomly assigned for observation (which was considered standard care until the NIH consensus conference) or adjuvant chemotherapy with LV (200 mg/m2) plus 5-FU (350 mg/m2), both given i.v. (days 1-4) and i.p. (days 1 and 3) every 4 weeks for a total of six courses. After a median follow-up time of 4.6 years, a comparative analysis between the two groups of patients suggested both an improvement in disease-free survival (75% versus 58%; P = 0.06) and a survival advantage (78% versus 63%; P = 0.05) in favour of adjuvant chemotherapy. The sites of recurrence were also different, i.e. local regional and intrahepatic tumour recurrences were observed in only 6/58 (10%) and 5/58 (9%) adjuvant treated patients as compared to 11/60 (18%) and 10/60 (17%) observed patients. The overall benefit of adjuvant therapy appeared to be greatest in patients with stage III colon cancer. Treatment-associated toxicity was infrequent and generally mild with only 5% experiencing severe (WHO grade 3) adverse reactions. Interim results of this adjuvant trial suggest that combined i.p. plus systemic i.v. chemotherapy with 5-FU and LV represents a potentially effective adjuvant regimen in stage II/III colon cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="244"><COL><DATA> The efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for colorectal cancer remains unproven. We have investigated the efficacy of a perioperative intraportal cytotoxic regimen in a randomised trial of 533 patients with operable colorectal carcinoma. Patients were randomly assigned either a single course of portal infusion with mitomycin (10 mg/m2, one dose) plus fluorouracil (500 mg/m2 per 24 h for 7 days) starting immediately after surgery, or no adjuvant treatment. 505 (94%) were evaluable. At median follow-up of 8 years, adjuvant therapy reduced the risk of recurrence by 21% (hazard ratio 0.79 [95% CI 0.62-1.00], p = 0.051) and the risk of death by 26% (0.74 [0.57-0.97], p = 0.026). The lower risk of relapse was observed in all subgroups based on node status or localisation of the tumour; the risk reduction was greatest in patients with tumour-involved lymph nodes (Dukes&apos; C; 0.67 [0.45-0.99], p = 0.045) and for those with colon cancer (0.78 [0.56-1.09], p = 0.151). Most of the difference in overall and disease-free survival could be attributed to a consistent reduction of all kinds of tumour recurrences (local relapses, liver metastases, and other distant metastases) in the treated group, rather than to a reduction of liver relapses only. We conclude that part of the benefit obtained with a single course of adjuvant chemotherapy via the portal vein for patients with operable colorectal carcinoma might be due to the systemic effects of the portal chemotherapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="257"><COL><DATA> Adjuvant/Adult/Aged/Antineoplastic Agents/Chemotherapy/Combined/Combined/tu [Therapeutic Use]/Female/FlagRectal/Fluorouracil/ad [Administration &amp; Dosage]/Human/Levamisole/ad [Administration &amp; Dosage]/Male/Middle Age/Neoplasm Staging/Radiotherapy/Rectal/Rectal Neoplasms/dt [Drug Therapy]/Rectal Neoplasms/pa [Pathology]/Rectal Neoplasms/rt [Radiotherapy]/Rectal Neoplasms/su [Surgery]/Treatment Outcome</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="258"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND. From 1980 to 1987, 849 patients with clinically resectable rectal adenocarcinoma were randomized into a controlled clinical trial to evaluate the role of preoperative radiotherapy. METHODS. Patients were given either 25 Gy during 5 to 7 days before surgery or underwent surgery alone. RESULTS. At a median follow-up time of 107 months (range, 62-144 months) the incidence of pelvic recurrence among 684 &quot;curatively&quot; operated patients was significantly lower among those who also received radiotherapy (P &lt; 0.001) in all Dukes&apos; stages. No significant difference was observed between the treatment groups with regard to frequency of distant metastases or overall survival. The time to local recurrence or distant metastasis and survival was significantly prolonged in the irradiated group. However, the postoperative mortality was 8% in the radiotherapy group compared with 2% in the surgery only group (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. Preoperative short term radiotherapy reduced the incidence of pelvic recurrences and prolonged survival related to rectal cancer compared with surgery alone.

METHODS: Of 234 consecutive patients undergoing abdominoperineal rectal excision for carcinoma between January 1983 and August 1990, unsatisfactory hemostasis or gross intraoperative septic contamination were recorded in 48 patients who were not included in the trial. After rectal excision and closure of the perineum, the remaining 186 patients were randomized to receive passive drainage (PD; n = 96) or closed suction drainage (SD; n = 90). Eighteen patients were withdrawn because of protocol violation, and three were lost to follow-up, leaving 165 (89 PD and 76 SD) patients for analysis. Preoperative factors (sex, age, degree of obesity, weight loss, anemia, or presence of ascites), intraoperative and pathologic findings (Dukes stage), and postoperative courses (recurrence, late mortality) were similar in both groups. All patients were followed up for 12 months or until death. RESULTS: The rate of perineums healed at one month was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) in PD (55/89 = 61 percent) compared with SD (54/72 = 75 percent) patients. At three months, the rate of healed perineums no longer differed between the two groups (70/87 = 81 percent vs. 60/72 = 84 percent). The number of vaginal fistulas, secondary reopenings, and perineums not healed at 12 months was similar in both groups. Median duration to complete healing was similar in both groups (23 vs. 21 days, respectively). On the other hand, three retained drains were seen in PD patients only. The median duration of hospital stay was identical in both groups (22 days). Seven patients died in the early postoperative period, including one in the PD group and six in the SD group. There was no significant difference in the number of late deaths (3 vs. 7) in PD and SD patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that closed suction drainage should be used after abdominoperineal rectal excision with satisfactory hemostasis or absence of gross introperative septic contamination</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="281"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Phase II studies have shown that the combination of interferon alfa-2b (IFN) and fluorouracil (5-FU) is active in patients with metastatic colon cancer. This study was designed to investigate whether treatment with the combination of IFN and 5-FU could improve the response rate, duration of response, or survival compared with treatment with 5-FU alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed advanced colorectal cancer were randomized to receive 5-FU 750 mg/m2/d by continuous infusion for 5 consecutive days followed by weekly bolus 5-FU 750 mg/m2 either with or without IFN 10 MU subcutaneously three times weekly. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to 12 months. RESULTS: Radiologic response was observed in 26 of 106 assessable patients (25%): 10 of 52 (19%) in the group that received 5-FU plus IFN (all partial responses [PRs]) and 16 of 54 (30%) in the 5-FU-alone group (three complete responses [CRs] and 13 PRs) (P = .21). There was similarly no significant difference between the two groups in progression-free survival (median, 3 months), 1-year survival, or overall survival (median, 8 months). However, patients who received IFN did experience significantly more toxicity in the form of leukopenia (P = .013), lymphopenia (P = .01), depression (P = .014), and alopecia (P = .002), and were significantly more likely to be withdrawn due to adverse events (P = .003). There were four toxic deaths, all of which occurred in patients who had received IFN.

The study was based on 1292 patients included in two consecutive controlled randomized trials of preoperative radiotherapy in operable rectal carcinoma. The outcome was not related to surgical method. Radiotherapy increased postoperative mortality and complications and reduced local and distant recurrence, but had no effect on overall survival. Effects of radiotherapy were similar irrespective of the type of surgery, except that the increase in postoperative mortality in irradiated patients was greater in those treated with abdominoperineal resection. Sphincter-saving procedures appear to have no adverse effects on outcome of rectal cancer, but the optimum use of radiotherapy is still to be defined</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="300"><COL><DATA> Local recurrence rates of rectal carcinoma have been analysed among 284 patients in a prospective randomized multicentre trial of adjuvant preoperative radiotherapy for locally advanced rectal carcinoma. Wide variations in local recurrence rates are demonstrated depending on the definition of local recurrence employed and the subgroup studied. Thus after surgical operation alone, rates as high as 43.3 per cent or as low as 12.7 per cent can be calculated. After both adjuvant preoperative radiotherapy and operation the overall local recurrence rate is 12.8 per cent, although the local recurrence rate inside the radiotherapy field (true recurrence) may be as low as 2.3 per cent. It is recommended that local recurrence after operation for rectal carcinoma be defined as any detectable local disease at follow-up, occurring either alone or in conjunction with generalized recurrence, in patients who have undergone resection. A rate should be given both for all patients and for those operated on for cure, but not for the latter group alone as this could introduce bias</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="310"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Different studies have shown that low colorectal and coloanal anastomosis often yield poor functional results. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a colonic reservoir is able to improve functional results. METHODS: Thirty-eight consecutive patients subjected to low anterior resection were randomized following rectal excision in two groups. One (n = 19) had a stapled straight coloanal anastomosis, and the other (n = 19) had a 10-cm stapled colonic pouch low rectal anastomosis. Median anastomotic distance above the anal verge was 3.38 +/- 0.56 cm and 2.14 +/- 0.36 cm in both groups, respectively. Continence alterations, urgency, tenesmus, defecatory frequency, anal resting and maximum voluntary squeezing pressures, and maximum tolerable volume were evaluated one year later. RESULTS: One patient died of pulmonary embolism, and seven presented with a recurrence and were excluded from the study. Stool frequency was greater than three movements per day in 33.3 percent of cases with a reservoir and in 73.3 percent of those with a straight coloanal anastomosis (P &lt; 0.05). Maximum tolerable volume was significantly greater in patients with a reservoir (335 +/- 195) than in those without (148 +/- 38) (P &lt; 0.05).

The HQL was assessed during the first 120 days of treatment by the patient-generated functional living index-cancer (FLIC) questionnaire. Also assessed were clinician-generated measures to evaluate physical functioning and suffering: Karnofsky performance status (KPS), body weight, disease symptoms, and hospitalization. No significant difference was detected between treatment groups in HQL or in any measurement of efficacy or toxicity. The number of patients hospitalized was similar in both groups, 35 patients receiving 5-FU-LV, 32 receiving 5-FU-placebo, but those receiving 5-FU-LV were hospitalized longer (450 vs 315 total days). The KPS improved or stabilized in 23% and 37% of patients, respectively. Overall, FLIC scores significantly improved in 27% or remained stable in 62% of all patients; disease symptoms improved in 19-49%; a weight increase of 2 kg or more occurred in 27%. A change in FLIC was not associated with tumor response or improvement in pain, but a decline in FLIC was associated with improved survival. An improvement in KPS or weight was associated with tumor response and strongly correlated with survival. Improvement of pain was associated with a stable or increase in weight, and worsening of pain correlated with lack of tumor response</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="322"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of a H2 receptor antagonist (cimetidine) on survival in patients with colorectal carcinoma, a randomized, controlled pilot study was performed in three university hospitals in Copenhagen, Denmark. METHODS: A total of 192 patients, who had undergone a resection or an exploratory operation for adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum between May 1988 and May 1991, were enrolled in the study. After a median observation time of 40 months, outcome was noted for each patient concerning cancer-specific mortality rate. RESULTS: In patients operated with curative intent (n = 148), no difference was found in cancer-specific mortality between the two treatments. However, a tendency toward reduction in mortality rate was found in patients with curatively operated Dukes Stage C carcinoma (P = 0.11, log-rank test; difference, 29 percent; 90 percent confidence interval, 2 to 57 percent) in the cimetidine-treated group. In patients with disseminated disease no total difference was found between the two treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Cimetidine does not seem to reduce mortality in patients with colorectal cancer, but there seems to be a tendency toward a survival benefit in patients undergoing surgery for Dukes Stage C carcinoma.

METHODS: The outcome of patients with sutured and stapled colorectal anastomoses were compared in a prospective, multicenter, randomized study. Factors affecting long-term outcomes were assessed by both univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Seven hundred thirty-two patients were recruited. There was a significant increase in radiologic leakage in the sutured group (14.4% vs. 5.2%, p &lt; 0.05), but there was no difference in clinical anastomotic leak rates, morbidity, or postoperative mortality. Tumor recurrence and cancer-specific mortality were higher in the sutured patients (7.5% and 6.7%, respectively) and in patients with anastomotic leaks.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients who attended our unit with histologically confirmed advanced colorectal cancer were randomized to receive either PVI 5-FU 300 mg/m2/d via Hickman line, and IFN 5 MU subcutaneously three times weekly, or PVI 5-FU alone. Treatment was given for a maximum of two 10-week blocks, with a 2-week gap for reassessment of all parameters. Quality of life (QL) was measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) pretreatment and every 6 weeks thereafter. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients were randomized, with 155 eligible for assessment. Radiologic response was observed in 43 patients (28%): 17 of 77 (22%) in the 5-FU-plus-IFN arm (all partial responses [PRs]) and 26 of 78 (33%) in the 5-FU-alone group (complete responses [CRs] and 22 PRs) (difference not significant). Symptomatic improvement occurred in the majority of patients, and equally in both arms: 61% to 80% depending on the symptom. There was no significant difference between the two groups in failure-free survival (median, 161 v 193 days) or overall survival (median, 328 v 357 days). However, patients who received IFN did experience significantly more toxicity in the form of leukopenia (P = .001), neutropenia (P = .04), mucositis (P = .008), and alopecia (P = .0002). There were no toxic deaths and few notable differences in QL between the two arms.

Thymus weight and thymocyte counts, especially cells presenting the immature or cytotoxic/suppressor phenotype were significantly increased. Due to enhanced emigration, peripheral blood lymphocyte and monocyte counts as well as expression of activation markers were significantly upregulated. The antimetastatic effect of Propionibacterium avidum KP-40 was demonstrated in BALB/c-mice, where RAW 117-H10 lymphosarcoma liver colonization was significantly reduced after immunostimulation. Clinical investigations proved that surgical treatment of colorectal carcinoma induced an evident decrease of peripheral blood lymphocytes as compared with preoperative counts. However, single preoperative Propionibacterium avidum KP-40 administration induced a considerable increase of peripheral white blood cell counts, especially lymphocytes. Clinical effects of preoperative immunostimulation by Propionibacterium granulosum KP-45 were investigated in a prospective randomized trial in colorectal carcinoma patients. Positive effects on survival time, local tumor recurrence and distant metastasis could be demonstrated in stages I and II, whereas no advantage of immunotherapy was found in advanced stages III and IV. A recent prospective randomized clinical trial was initiated on the quality of life of colorectal carcinoma patients.

An objective response rate of 15% (one complete response [CR] and 13 partial responses [PRs]) for 5-FU/FA and 13% (two CRs and nine PRs) for 5-FU/FA/DP was observed. The dose-intensity of 5-FU delivered was significantly higher (1.09- to 1.16-fold) for the DP-containing arm. Pharmacokinetic parameters of 5-FU did not differ significantly, except for a prolonged half-life (t1/2) induced by DP. The median time to progression (P = .8) and the median survival time (11.6 months for 5-FU/FA v 9.3 months for 5-FU/FA/DP; P = .14, log-rank test) were not different between treatment arms. CONCLUSION: Orally administered DP did not improve the antineoplastic activity of 5-FU/FA in patients with advanced colorectal cancer when used at this dose and schedule. The observed increase in 5-FU dose-intensity for FU/FA/DP was not clinically relevant</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="370"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intensified follow-up of patients with colorectal cancer can lead to improved reresectability and a better long-term survival. DESIGN: A prospective randomized trial of 106 patients. SETTING: Oulu University Hospital, a referral center in northern Finland. PATIENTS: A total of 106 consecutive patients who underwent radical resection for colorectal cancer, 54 of whom were randomized into a conventional follow-up group and 52 into an intensified follow-up group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: After a 5-year follow-up, the time of detection of recurrence, the recurrence rates, the first method showing recurrence, the mode of recurrence, reresectability, and survival were compared between the groups. RESULTS: The recurrences were identified earlier in the intensified follow-up group than in the conventional follow-up group (mean +/- SD, 10 +/- 5 months vs 15 +/- 10 months). The overall recurrence rate was 41%, with 39% in the conventional group and 42% in the intensified group. Carcinoembryonic antigen determination was the most common method showing recurrence in both groups. Endoscopy and ultrasound were beneficial in the intensified follow-up group, but computed tomography failed to improve the diagnostics. The mode of recurrence did not differ between the groups. Radical resections were performed on 19% (8/43) of the patients, 14% (3/21) in the conventional group and 22% (5/22) in the intensified group. The cumulative 5-year survival was 54% in the conventional group and 59% in the intensified group. CONCLUSION: Earlier detection of recurrent colorectal cancer by intensified follow-up does not lead to either significantly increased reresectability or improved 5-year survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="382"><COL><DATA> The aim of this study was to determine whether the preoperative administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) could increase the rate of autologous blood donation and reduce the perioperative need for homologous blood in anaemic patients with cancer. Twenty-two anaemic (haematocrit less than 34 per cent), iron-deficient (iron less than 700 micrograms/l) patients, with gastric or colorectal cancer scheduled for elective surgery, were allocated randomly to two groups. The first (n = 11) received iron saccharate 200 mg/day intravenously for 12 consecutive days. The second (n = 11) received rHuEPO subcutaneously (300 units/kg as first administration, and 100 units/kg 4, 8 and 12 days later) with supplemental iron. On days 4, 8 and 12, if the haematocrit was greater than 34 per cent, patients donated one unit (350 ml) of autologous blood. In the iron group the mean haematocrit did not change from admission (31 per cent) to day 12 of treatment (31 per cent), and no patient could donate autologous blood. In the rHuEPO group, eight patients donated two units of autologous blood and three donated one unit. Four patients in the iron group received perioperative transfusion of homologous blood compared with none in the rHuEPO group. Administration of rHuEPO facilitated the donation of autologous blood and reduced perioperative homologous blood transfusion in anaemic patients with cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="383"><COL><DATA> The authors examined the impact of the laparoscopic approach on the early outcome of resected colon carcinomas. The role of laparoscopic techniques in the treatment of colon carcinomas is questionable. Previous studies have suggested technical feasibility of surgical resections of these cancers by laparoscopic means and have implied a benefit to laparoscopic technique for patients undergoing colorectal resections. A prospective, randomized study was conducted comparing laparoscopic assisted colectomy (LAC) open colectomy (OC) for colon cancer. We present the preliminary results in relation to the short-term outcome and judge the feasibility of the laparoscopic procedure to as a way of performing accurate oncologic resection and staging. Benefit has been demonstrated with LAC in this setting. Passing flatus, oral intake, and discharge from hospital occurred earlier in LAC- than OC-treated patients. The mean operative time was significantly longer in the LAC group than in the OC group. The overall morbidity was significantly lower in the LAC group. No significant differences were observed between both groups in the number of lymph nodes removed or the pathological stage following the Astler-Coller modification of the Dukes classification. The laparoscopic approach improves the short-term outcome of segmental colectomies for colon cancer. However, the further follow-up of these patients will allow us to answer in the near future whether or not the LAC may influence the long-term outcome.</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="384"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: The primary goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) to prevent tumor relapse following potentially curative surgery in patients with high-risk colon cancer. A secondary goal was to determine the effect of IFN-gamma on immune function and to correlate alterations in immune parameters with survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three to 4 weeks after undergoing resection of all known malignant disease, 99 patients with stage II, III, or IV colon cancer were randomly assigned to receive IFN-gamma 0.2 mg total dose by subcutaneous injection daily for 6 months or observation. Serial assessment of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression and Fc receptors on peripheral-blood monocytes was conducted in 24 patients who received IFN-gamma and 27 control patients. RESULTS: With a median follow-up duration of 59 months in patients still alive, there was evidence of a detrimental effect on time to relapse (P = .03) among patients who received IFN-gamma. There was no significant difference in patient survival (P = .12). This study has sufficient power to rule out a 25% reduction in death rate for patients who received IFN-gamma (P &lt; .05). Significant enhancement of immune function was observed in patients treated with IFN-gamma as measured by HLA-DR expression (P &lt; .01) and Fc receptors (P &lt; .001) on peripheral-blood monocytes. CONCLUSION: This study effectively rules out any clinically meaningful benefit for IFN-gamma as surgical adjuvant treatment for patients with high-risk colon cancer. Although significant enhancement of nonspecific immune function was seen with this dosage administration schedule of IFN-gamma, this was not associated with any demonstrable antitumor effect</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="511"><COL><DATA> Forty patients with metastatic liver disease from colorectal carcinoma are presented in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: Group A (20 patients) who had liver resection and Group B (20 patients) who had liver resection combined with post-operative locoregional immuno- therapy + chemotherapy. Thus, during the first year following surgery, they have four courses of targeted locoregional transarterial chemotherapy-immunotherapy, two courses during the second year and one course during the third year. Two patients died, one in each group, during the first 30 postoperative days. Survival in Group A (19 surviving patients) ranged from 4 to 25 months, mean 11 months. Eight (8) patients had intrahepatic recurrence of the disease and 11 are still alive and free of disease. Of those with intrahepatic recurrence, three (3) patients died 15, 15 and 17 months following surgery of causes related to the disease. In Group B (19 surviving patients), survival ranged from 3 to 30 months, mean 20 months. At present, all 19 patients are alive and free of disease (p &lt; 0.001). None has had intrahepatic recurrence (p &lt; 0.001). On the basis of present results, liver resection supplemented with postoperative targeted transarterial locoregional immunotherapy-chemotherapy is associated with optimal results.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective randomized phase III trial performed by 35 cancer centers within the Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). Six hundred sixty-three eligible patients were randomly allocated to receive either doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 (arm A), cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine (CYVADIC) (arm B), or ifosfamide 5 g/m2 plus doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 (arm C). RESULTS: The overall response rate was 24% (95% confidence interval, 20.7% to 27.3%) among eligible patients and 26% among assessable patients. No statistically significant difference was detected among the three study arms in terms of response rate (arm A, 23.3%; arm B, 28.4%; and arm C, 28.1%), remission duration (median, 46 weeks on arm A, 48 weeks on arm B, and 44 weeks on arm C), or overall survival (median, 52 weeks on arm A, 51 weeks on arm B, and 55 weeks on arm C). The degree of myelosuppression was significantly greater for the combination of ifosfamide and doxorubicin than for the other two regimens. Cardiotoxicity was also more frequent in this arm, but other toxicities were similar. CONCLUSION: In advanced soft tissue sarcomas of adults, single-agent doxorubicin is still the standard chemotherapy against which more intensive or new drug treatments should be compared. Combination chemotherapy cannot be recommended outside a controlled clinical trial with the exclusion of some subsets of sarcoma patients for whom significant tumor volume reduction may be an important end point of a chemotherapy regimen</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="696"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND. Arterially administered iodized oil (Lipiodol) is selectively retained by hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), and has been used as a vehicle for delivery of therapeutic agents to these tumors. This study compared the efficacy of Lipiodol-targeted epirubicin chemotherapy with Lipiodol-131I radiotherapy. METHODS. Ninety-five patients with unresectable HCC confined to the liver were administered either Lipiodol-epirubicin emulsion (n = 69; 61 cirrhotics; Okuda tumor Stage I, 14; II, 37; III, 18; epirubicin dose, 75 mg/m2) or Lipiodol-131I (131I) (n = 26; 18 cirrhotics; Okuda tumor Stage I, 6; II, 19; III, 1; dose 750-1050 MBq). The last 28 patients (17 epirubicin, 11 131I) were treated within a prospective randomized trial. Bolus drug or isotope was injected into the hepatic artery by transfemoral cannulation. Lipiodol and 131I uptake were gauged by 10th day computed tomography and 48-hour scintiscan. Treatments were repeated two-monthly when indicated. RESULTS. Tumor size at 2 months remained static or diminished partially in 21 of 38 epirubicin recipients (55%) and 15/22 131I recipients (68%). Actuarial survival at 6, 12, and 24 months was 40%, 25%, and 6% with epirubicin, and 58%, 25%, and 0% with 131I; 30-day mortality was 11% and 15%, respectively. Comparison with historic controls indicated survival benefit in Stages I and II. Similar findings were recorded in the 28 patients in the randomized trial. CONCLUSIONS. Patients with unresectable HCC receiving Lipiodol-epirubicin or Lipiodol-131I show good tumor localization, acceptable toxicity, and comparable survival benefit at 6 and 12 months with either modality</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="697"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) versus repeated TACE in the treatment of large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients with cirrhosis and a large HCC (main tumor, 3.1-8.0 cm in diameter with no more than two daughter nodules) were enrolled in a prospective, randomized study. Twenty-six patients underwent a single TACE session followed by PEI (TACE-PEI group), whereas 27 patients underwent two to five TACE sessions (TACE group). Both groups of patients were similar with regard to liver function. Follow-up ranged from 8 to 39 months. RESULTS: Complete therapeutic responses were higher (P &lt; .05) and tumor recurrences during follow-up were lower (P &lt; .05) in the TACE-PEI group than in the TACE group. Patients in the TACE-PEI group survived longer than those in the TACE group, although the difference was not significant (P &gt; .1).

METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive patients with cirrhosis undergoing 75 procedures were randomized into Group I [(n = 37) allocated to receive prophylactic antibiotics (Cefotaxime + Metronidazole)] and Group II [(n = 38) allocated to receive no antibiotic treatment]. RESULTS: Twelve of the 37 patients (32%) in Group I and 13 of the 38 patients (34%) in Group II developed fever &gt; 38 degrees C after treatment. However, none of them developed bacterial infection, and all biological fluid cultures were negative. A logistic regression analysis disclosed that the obtention of an extensive tumor necrosis was the unique parameter independently associated with the development of fever. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic prophylaxis is therefore not necessary in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing transarterial embolization. The appearance of fever after this procedure does not indicate bacterial infection; it rather represents a clinical marker of extensive tumor necrosis and thus of a favorable response to treatment</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="699"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: The progression of hepatocellular carcinoma may be influenced by estrogens. This has offered the rationale for evaluating the therapeutic usefulness of estrogen-receptor blockers; it is being debated whether long-term tamoxifen administration improves survival in patients with this neoplasm. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of tamoxifen administration in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: One hundred twenty patients with this neoplasm who were not suitable for surgery, ethanol injection, or transarterial embolization were included in a placebo-controlled trial and randomized to tamoxifen, 20 mg/day per os, (group A, n = 58) or placebo (group B, n = 62).

Eligibility criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, 2, or 3, as well as adequate kidney and liver function and hematologic reserve. The number of patients with lethal, life-threatening, and severe toxicities on beta-interferon were 1, 3, and 12 and on menogaril 2, 5, and 10, respectively. No objective responses were documented among the 61 patients who had HCC, histologically reviewed and confirmed. The time to treatment failure was 6.7 weeks on beta-interferon and 8.6 weeks on menogaril. The median survival time was 11.1 weeks on beta-interferon and 23.1 weeks on menogaril (South African patients 10.1 weeks). The difference is not significant. Poor prognostic factors were jaundice, age, and associated hepatitis. After controlling for other covariates, beta-interferon appears to increase the relative risk of dying by 2.7.

Liver resection, although the optimal method of management, is associated with a high incidence of intrahepatic tumour recurrence ranging between 50-70%, 12 to 18 months following surgery. This study assesses prospectively the results of liver resection as compared to liver resection combined with pre- and post-operative locoregional chemotherapy-immunotherapy in 40 patients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups. Group A (20 patients) had liver resection only, while Group B (20 patients) had liver resection combined with pre- and past-operative targeting locoregional chemotherapy-immunotherapy. Five (5) patients died in total: two from Group A and two from Group B, during the first 30 days following surgery due to reasons related to the procedure (post-operative liver failure in three, pulmonary embolism in one). The remaining patient from Group A died 10 months following liver resection due to intrahepatic tumour recurrence. From Group A, 17 patients are alive from 3 to 26 months after surgery. Of the 17 alive patients, 10 are free of disease and 7 show intrahepatic recurrence. Thus, tumour intrahepatic recurrence occurred in 8 patients of group A. From Group B, all 18 patients are alive and free of disease from 4 to 27 months after surgery. No patient died because of the disease nor has any patient shown intrahepatic tumour recurrence.

METHODS: This study was a randomized control trial. Patients in two groups (groups A and B: n = 29) were each given an intravenous injection of 10 units of insulin and 1 mg glucagon every 12 hours for 1 week after Lipiodol-targeted chemotherapy. Patients in group B (n = 11) were each given an intravenous injection of 20 micrograms lipo-PGE1 every 12 hours over 1 week. Several items, including conventional liver function tests, were evaluated at the start of the study and on the days 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 after Lipiodol-targeted chemotherapy. RESULTS: Combined lipo-PGE1/glucagon-insulin therapy can prevent the elevation of serum ALT level and total bilirubin level after Lipiodol-targeted chemotherapy. In the group A (glucagon-insulin therapy only), the maximum level in the follow-up interval was statistically higher than that in the pretreatment level (p &lt; 0.05), whereas there was no significant difference in group B (treated with combined glucagon-insulin therapy and lipo-PGE1).

Chemoembolization with lipiodol (iodized oil) is widely used to treat patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Severe side effects have been reported, and improved survival has not been clearly demonstrated. METHODS. Patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who did not have severe liver disease and who met additional entry criteria were randomly assigned to receive either lipiodol chemoembolization (70 mg of cisplatin, 10 ml of lipiodol, and gelatin-sponge [Gelfoam] particles delivered through the hepatic artery) or conservative management involving treatment of complications and pain. Courses of treatment were to be given every two months for a maximum of four courses. The main end point was survival. RESULTS. The study was stopped in December, 1992, after a sequential analysis showed the lack of the expected benefit from chemoembolization. As of October 1, 1994, 39 of the 50 patients assigned to chemoembolization and 40 of the 46 patients assigned to conservative management had died. Twenty-six patients assigned to chemoembolization received all four courses of treatment. There was no significant difference in survival between the two groups, although there was a trend favoring the chemoembolization group (estimated relative risk of death in the control group, 1.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.9 to 2.2; P = 0.13). The comparison of survival between the two groups was not substantially changed by adjustments for differences in base-line and prognostic characteristics (adjusted relative risk, 1.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 2.1; P = 0.31). At one year, the estimated survival rates were 62 percent in the chemoembolization group (95 percent confidence interval, 48.6 to 75.4 percent) and 43.5 percent in the conservative-management group (95 percent confidence interval, 29.2 to 57.8 percent). In the chemoembolization group, tumor growth, as assessed by tumor size and serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration, was reduced and the incidence of portal obstruction was lower than in the conservative-management group. Liver failure occurred after 47 courses of treatment in 30 patients assigned to chemoembolization. CONCLUSIONS.

Fifty-two patients with resectable large HCC (defined as a maximal tumour diameter of 10 cm or more) were prospectively randomized into two groups: group 1 comprised 24 patients who had 1-5 sessions of TACE before operation; group 2 consisted of the other 28 patients, on whom surgery was performed without delay. Tumour volume was reduced to a mean (s.d.) of 42.8 (15.3) per cent in 16 patients in group 1, but remained unchanged in four and increased in size in a further four. Patients in group 1 had a slightly longer operating time (5.5 versus 4.6 h, P = 0.09), a higher rate of concomitant resection of adjacent organs (58 versus 25 per cent, P = 0.03) and a higher rate of histological invasion to these organs (33 versus 4 per cent, P = 0.01). No difference was found between the two groups in operative blood loss, operative morbidity and mortality rates, and pathological staging. The disease-free survival rate in the two groups was similar, but the incidence of extrahepatic cancer recurrence was higher in group 1 (57 versus 23 per cent, P = 0.03). The actuarial survival rate was also significantly worse in group 1 when determined from the time of detection of the tumour (P = 0.03) or from operation (P = 0.01).

Seventy-seven patients were evaluated for tumor response and survival. The patients were randomized to receive two cycles of cisplatin 100 mg/m2 Day 1,5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2 24-h infusion Days 2, 3, and 4 before radical radiotherapy, and four cycles of postradiotherapy chemotherapy (37 patients) or radiotherapy alone (40 patients). All patients received radical radiotherapy to the nasopharynx and neck. The nasopharynx and upper neck were treated to 66 Gy by conventional fractionation and the lower neck to 58 Gy. Booster radiotherapy (7.5 Gy/two fractions/week) was given to any residual nodes after standard radiotherapy. RESULTS: The patient characteristics, including staging, were similar in both arms. The overall response rate to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 81% (19% complete response, 62% partial response). The rates of radiotherapy for boosting parapharyngeal disease or residual lymph nodes were not significantly different in the two arms. The overall complete response rate to chemoradiotherapy was 100%, and to radiotherapy alone, 95%. Toxicities in the chemoradiotherapy arm were mainly myelosuppression, nephrotoxicity, and nausea and vomiting. The degree of mucositis was not significantly different in the two arms. There was no treatment-related death. The median follow up was 28.5 months. The 2-year overall survival was 80% in the chemoradiotherapy arm and 80.5% in the radiotherapy arm.

Conjugation of polyethylene glycol to recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2) results in a compound, polyethylene glycol-modified IL-2 (PEG-IL-2) that retains the in vitro and in vivo activity of IL-2, but exhibits a markedly prolonged circulating half-life. In mice, one dose of PEG-IL-2 results in tumor regression comparable to that achieved with multiple bolus doses of IL-2. Based on these preclinical studies, a Phase I study with PEG-IL-2 was undertaken in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and melanoma. Then, to exploit the higher peak levels attained with IL-2 and the improved trough levels of PEG-IL-2, a combination regimen beginning with bolus IL-2 followed by low dose maintenance PEG-IL-2 was devised and tested for efficacy. METHODS. Patients with measurable metastatic melanoma or RCC were entered in a Phase I dose escalation trial of PEG-IL-2 given once a week by intravenous bolus. This trial then was repeated using a twice-a-week schedule. After determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and a safe outpatient regimen for PEG-IL-2, a hybrid regimen combining an initial high dose IL-2 cycle followed by chronic maintenance with weekly PEG-IL-2 was devised. This regimen was compared with a standard regimen consisting of two cycles of high dose unconjugated IL-2 in a randomized prospective clinical trial. RESULTS. When given by intravenous bolus once a week, the MTD of PEG-IL-2 was 12 million IU/m2, with toxicities similar to those of unconjugated IL-2. A twice-a-week schedule was less well tolerated. Of 28 patients given 32 treatment courses at varied dose levels, there were two partial responses and one minor response. A total of 124 patients with metastatic melanoma or RCC were randomized to either standard unconjugated IL-2 therapy or the hybrid regimen. There was no treatment-related mortality in either arm, and the use of PEG-IL-2 resulted in a significant decrease in the need for intensive-care-unit care. The response rates (partial response and complete response) for patients with RCC and melanoma were 19% and 15%, respectively, for IL-2 alone and 17% and 11%, respectively, for the IL-2 and PEG-IL-2 combination. CONCLUSIONS. The combination of high dose IL-2 followed by PEG-IL-2 is a well tolerated regimen with significant activity against RCC and melanoma, but it shows no significant increase in antitumor activity compared with high dose IL-2 alone</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="821"><COL><DATA> A prospectively randomized trial was undertaken to compare dacarbazine (DTIC) alone with DTIC plus interferon in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma. Of the 73 patients who entered on the study, 36 were randomized to receive DTIC alone and 37 were randomized to receive the combination DTIC plus interferon. The two sections were well balanced. There was more toxicity on the combination section, but no life threatening toxicity. The overall response rate for patients on DTIC was 20% (two complete and five partial responses) (95% CI 7-39%) and for patients on DTIC plus interferon was 50% (13 complete and four partial responses) (95% CI 26-72%) (p = 0.007). The median time to treatment failure, was significantly more in favour of the combination treatment (9 versus 2.5 months; p &lt; 0.01, Mantel-Cox). The median survival of 16.7 versus 8 months was in favor of the combination treatment (p &lt; 0.01). The reasons for the improved results with the combination treatment are discussed.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Interferon alfa-2a (IFN-alpha 2a) 20 x 10(6) U/m2 was administered three times each week for 12 weeks by the intramuscular route. Both the treatment group (n = 131) and the control group (n = 131) were evenly balanced with regard to relevant prognostic discriminants. RESULTS: The median disease-free survival (DFS) time was 2.4 years for the IFN-alpha 2a group and 2.0 years for the observation group (log-rank P = 0.19). The median survival times were 6.6 years for IFN-alpha 2a and 5.0 years for observation (log-rank P = .40). For stage I patients (n = 102), there was no apparent therapeutic advantage from IFN-alpha 2a therapy. The DFS for stage II patients was a median of 10.8 months in the control group versus 17 months in the treatment group. The overall survival time was 4.1 years for the treatment group versus 2.7 years for the control group. The differences in DFS for stage II patient were significant in a Cox model. These results must be interpreted cautiously because of subset analysis. A severe flu-like toxicity occurred in 44% of patients, 13% lost at least 10% of their baseline weight, and 45% experienced a worsening of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score.

Overall, the 2-year actuarial local tumour control was 37 (SE 5)%. Univariate analysis showed a beneficial effect of hyperthermia (radiation alone 28% vs combined treatment 46%, p = 0.008) and radiation dose (24 Gy 25% vs 27 Gy 56%, p = 0.02), but no effect of tumour size (&lt; or = 4 cm 42% vs &gt; 4 cm 29%, p = 0.21). Cox multivariate regression analysis showed the most important prognostic variables to be hyperthermia (odds ratio for 2-year local control 1.73 [95% CI 1.07-2.78], p = 0.023), tumour size (0.91 [0.85-0.99], p = 0.05), and radiation dose (1.17 [1.01-1.36], p = 0.05). Addition of heat did not significantly increase acute or late radiation reactions. Heating was well tolerated, but because of difficulties with equipment only 14% of treatments achieved the protocol objective. The overall 5-year survival rate was 19%, but 38% of the patients for whom all known disease was controlled survived 5 years. Adjuvant hyperthermia significantly improved local tumour control when applied in association with radiation in treatment of malignant melanoma.

In a Phase II trial, surgical adjuvant active specific immunotherapy using a live vaccinia virus-augmented allogeneic polyvalent melanoma cell lysate, vaccinia melanoma oncolysate (VMO), produced a significant disease free interval (DFI) in patients with International Union Against Cancer Stage II melanoma with positive lymph nodes. Therefore, a Phase III randomized prospective, double-blind, multiinstitutional, surgical adjuvant VMO trial was performed to determine the efficacy of VMO to increase the DFI and the overall survival in this group of patients with Stage II disease. METHODS. Two hundred and fifty patients with Stage II melanoma were divided into two postsurgical groups. One group received VMO (total protein equals 2 mg/ml) and the other received the placebo of live vaccinia vaccine virus (V) (10(5.4) TCID50/ml), an adjuvant component of the VMO. Patients initially received these biologics once a week for 13 weeks and then once every 2 weeks for an additional 39 weeks or until recurrence. All surviving patients have been followed for at least 30 months. RESULTS. Statistical analysis of survival data (n = 217) for this first interim analysis shows that there is no statistically significant (P = 0.99) increase in DFI of patients treated with VMO (n = 104) when compared with V (n = 113). The median DFI is 38.0 months for patients treated with VMO and 37.0 months for patients treated with V. At 2- and 4-year intervals, 70 and 38%, respectively, of patients treated with VMO vs. 66 and 36%, respectively, of patients treated with V were free of melanoma. The median overall survival is not available because the patients treated with VMO have not yet reached the 50% mark and the median overall survival is 45.0 months for patients treated with V. At 2- and 4-year intervals, 70 and 38%, respectively, of VMO-treated patients survived when compared with 66 and 36%, respectively, of patients treated with V. Although the overall survival of patients treated with VMO is not statistically significant (P = 0.88) at this point, there is an increasing trend in the overall survival of patients treated with VMO; a 10% increase at the 4-year time point. Moreover, in the subset analysis, VMO-treated male patients (n = 63) showed a 17% improvement in survival at 4-year time point when compared with male patients treated with V (n = 67) (P = 0.19) at the same time point and male patients (n = 20) between the ages of 44 and 57 having 1-5 positive lymph nodes showed a 37% difference in overall survival at the 4-year time point when compared with those patients treated with V (n = 18) (P = 0.13) at the same time point. CONCLUSION. In this first interim analysis, active specific immunotherapy with VMO vs. V showed no difference in the disease free interval or overall survival. Subset analyses likewise showed no significant differences in outcome but the data suggest a potential difference in immunoreactivity between male and female patients with melanoma that awaits further follow up and may merit further investigation</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="969"><COL><DATA> A novel method of prophylaxis and treatment for peritoneal carcinomatosis--mitomycin C bound to activated carbon particles (MMC-CH)--was tested in patients with advanced gastric cancer in a prospective randomized study. Activated carbon particles are taken up selectively by lymphatic tissues, which seem to be a primary site of peritoneal carcinomatosis in the peritoneal cavity, and adsorb a large amount of anticancer agent mitomycin C, which is subsequently released slowly and for a protracted period. A group of 113 patients who underwent radical resection for gastric cancer with definite serosal involvement were entered in this trial. Those in the control group received no intraperitoneal anticancer drugs. Patients in the MMC-CH group were given 50 mg mitomycin C as MMC-CH, which was dispersed throughout the peritoneal cavity just before surgical closure. No other anticancer drugs were given to these patients after surgery. The 2- and 3-year survival rates for the MMC-CH group were 42% and 38%, respectively; and the rates for the control group were 28% and 20%, respectively. The difference in survival between the two groups was significant at 2 and 3 years (p &lt; 0.05). For the survival of patients with macroscopic peritoneal carcinomatosis, there was no difference between these two groups. For the survival of patients who underwent histologically curative resection, 2- and 3-year survivals for the MMC-CH group were 66% and 66%, respectively and for the control group 35% and 20%, respectively.

METHODS: One hundred seven patients were randomized to no follow-up (control group; n = 54) or intense follow-up (follow-up group; n = 53) after surgery and early postoperative colonoscopy. Patients in the follow-up group were followed at frequent intervals with clinical examination, rigid proctosigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, computed tomography of the pelvis (in patients operated with abdominoperineal resection), pulmonary x-ray, liver function tests, and determinations of carcinoembryonic antigen and fecal hemoglobin. Follow- up ranged from 5.5 to 8.8 years after primary surgery. RESULTS: Tumor recurred in 18 patients (33 percent) in the control group and in 17 patients (32 percent) in the follow-up group. Reresection with curative intent was performed in three patients in the control group and in five patients (four of whom were asymptomatic) in the follow-up group. In the follow-up group two asymptomatic patients with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen levels were disease-free three and five and one-half years after reresection and were the only patients apparently cured by reresection. No patient underwent surgery for metastatic disease in the liver or lungs. Symptomatic metachronous carcinoma was detected in one patient (control group) after three years. Five-year survival rate was 67 percent in the control group and 75 percent in the follow-up group (P &gt; 0.05); the corresponding cancer-specific survival rates were 71 percent and 78 percent, respectively.

Reports have described a large variety of techniques for performing this anastomosis and managing the pancreatic stump. In an attempt to obviate the pancreaticojejunostomy, we prospectively studied the technique of ligating the pancreatic duct and using external drains to create a temporary controlled pancreaticocutaneous fistula. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive patients who were to undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary carcinoma were prospectively randomized to one of two groups: pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) (n = 18) or controlled pancreaticocutaneous fistula (CPF) (n = 17). The groups were well matched for age, sex, coexisting medical illnesses, type of tumor, and preoperative condition. Except for the management of the pancreatic remnant, all patients in both groups underwent an identical procedure. Major morbidity, length of hospitalization, duration of the controlled pancreatic fistula, and mortality were analyzed over a mean follow-up interval of 26 months (range 5 months to 7.5 years). RESULTS: The CPF group experienced lower overall operative morbidity rates than the PJ group (24% versus 56%, P &lt; 0.01). Two patients (11%) in the PJ group and none in the CPF group died (P = NS). Half the morbidity in the PJ group and both mortalities were related to anastomotic leak. The CPF and PJ groups left the hospital after mean stays of 26.4 and 42.2 days respectively (&lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to pancreaticojejunal anastomosis, creation of a temporary controlled pancreaticocutaneous fistula in patients who undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary malignancy has no appreciable risk.

A prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in 33 Italian surgical departments with the aim of evaluating the efficacy of octreotide in the prevention of pancreatic fistula after elective pancreatic resections. METHODS. Between July 1990 and May 1992, 278 patients were enrolled in the study. Fifty-four dropped out because of unresectable disease and six were excluded because of protocol violation; the remaining 218 were randomly assigned to the octreotide group (n = 111) or to the placebo group (n = 107). There were 131 men and 87 women with a mean age of 58.2 +/- 11.7 yrs. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was the most common operation performed (n = 143), sixty-four percent of patients had a pancreatic or periampullary cancer; chronic pancreatitis accounted for 8.2% of cases. RESULTS. Mortality rate was 6.9%. A pancreatic fistula occurred in 31 patients (14.2%), 9% in the octreotide group and 19.6% in the placebo group (p &lt; 0.05). Morbidity rate was significantly lower in the octreotide (21.6%) than in the placebo group (36.4%) (p &lt; 0.05).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized controlled clinical trial (INT-0035) was performed by National Cancer Institute- sponsored cancer clinical trials cooperative groups. Patients were assigned to observation only or to fluorouracil (450 mg/m2 intravenously [IV] daily for 5 days and, beginning at 28 days, weekly for 48 weeks) plus levamisole (50 mg orally three times daily for 3 days repeated every 2 weeks for 1 year). Cancer recurrence, survival, and treatment side effects were assessed. RESULTS: Three hundred eighteen eligible patients were analyzed with a median follow-up time of 7 years. Fluorouracil plus levamisole reduced the recurrence rate by 31%, although this trend was not statistically significant (P = .10). A total of 87 patients died: 43 on observation and 44 on fluorouracil plus levamisole. Disparity between effects on recurrence rate and overall survival is partially explained by a higher rate of non-colon cancer-related deaths on fluorouracil plus levamisole (15 v seven) and by the effects of salvage surgery with curative intent. Of seven patients with recurrence who were rendered disease-free by salvage surgery, six were on the observation arm. As was observed in patients treated with fluorouracil plus levamisole for stage III disease, toxicity was acceptable and compliance was excellent. CONCLUSION: Fluorouracil plus levamisole is tolerable and accepted as standard surgical adjuvant therapy for patients with stage III colon cancer, but the data from this study in stage II patients suggest a decreased relapse rate without a significant improvement in survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1088"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of two adjuvant therapy regimens in improving surgical cure rates in stage III (Dukes stage C) colon cancer.

SETTING: Major cancer centers, universities, and community clinics affiliated with the North Cancer Treatment Group, the Southwest Oncology Group, and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. PATIENTS: Those who had had curative-intent resections of stage III colon cancer in the previous 1 to 5 weeks. INTERVENTION: Patients were assigned to observation only, to levamisole alone (50 mg orally three times/d for 3 days, repeated every 2 weeks for 1 year), or to this regimen of levamisole plus fluorouracil (450 mg/m2 body surface area intravenously daily for 5 days and then, beginning at 28 days, weekly for 48 weeks). MEASUREMENTS: Rates of cancer recurrence and death. Early and late treatment side effects.Results: With all 929 eligible patients able to be followed for 5 years or more (median follow up 6.5 years), fluorouracil plus levamisole reduced the death rate by 33# (p=.0007). Levamisole reduced the recurrence rate by 2% and the death rate by only 6%. With few exceptions, toxicity was mile and patient compliance was wecellent. No evidence of late side effects was seen.Conclusion: Fluorouracil plus levamisole is tolerable adjuvant therapy to surgery; it has been confirmed to substantially increase cure rates for patients with high risk (stage III) colon cancer.

DESIGN--Randomized controlled trial from November 1979 to October 1986, with stratification by histology, para-aortic nodal status, and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage. SETTING--Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) multicenter clinical trial. PATIENTS--A total of 367 patients with FIGO stage IB or IIA primary cervical cancers measuring 4 cm or greater in lateral diameter or with FIGO stage IIB cervical cancers were randomized to RTOG protocol 79-20 to receive either standard pelvic only irradiation or pelvic plus para-aortic irradiation. INTERVENTION--Pelvic only irradiation consisted of a midplane pelvic dose of 40 to 50 Gy in 4.5 to 6.5 weeks with daily fractions of 1.6 to 1.8 Gy for 5 d/wk. Pelvic plus para-aortic irradiation delivered 44 to 45 Gy in 4.5 to 6.5 weeks with daily fractions of 1.6 to 1.8 Gy for 5 d/wk. A total dose of 4000 to 5000 mg/h of radium equivalent or 30 to 40 Gy was provided by intracavitary brachytherapy to point A. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Response rate, overall and disease-free survival, patterns of failure, and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS--Ten-year overall survival was 44% for the pelvic only irradiation arm and 55% for the pelvic plus para-aortic irradiation am (P = .02). Cumulative incidence of death due to cervical cancer was estimated as significantly higher in the pelvic only arm at 10 years (P = .01). Disease-free survival was similar in both arms; 40% for the pelvic only arm and 42% for the pelvic plus para-aortic arm. Locoregional failures were similar at 10 years for both arms (pelvic only, 35%; pelvic plus para-aortic, 31%; P = .44). In complete responders, the patterns of locoregional failures were the same for both arms, but there was a lower cumulative incidence for first distant failure in the pelvic plus para-aortic irradiation arm (P = .053). Survival following first failure was significantly higher in the pelvic plus para-aortic arm (P = .007). A higher percentage of local failures were salvaged long-term on the pelvic plus para-aortic arm compared with the pelvic only arm (25% vs 8%). The cumulative incidence of grade 4 and 5 toxicities at 10 years in the pelvic plus para-aortic arm was 8%, compared with 4% in the pelvic only arm (P = .06). The death rate due to radiotherapy complications was higher in the pelvic plus para-aortic arm (four [2%] of 170) compared with the pelvic only arm (one [1%] of 167) (P = .38). The proportion of deaths due to radiotherapy complications in the pelvic plus para-aortic arm was higher than in the pelvic only arm (four [6%] of 67 vs one [1%] of 85; P = .24). If the patient had abdominal surgery prior to para-aortic irradiation, the estimated cumulative incidence of grade 4 and 5 complications was 11%, compared with 2% in the pelvic only arm. CONCLUSIONS--The statistically significant difference in overall survival at 10 years for the pelvic plus para-aortic irradiation arm, without a difference in disease-free survival, can be explained by the following two factors: (1) a lower incidence of distant failure in complete responders and (2) a better salvage in the complete responders who later failed locally</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1124"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Pelvic radiation is standard treatment for women with stage IIb to IVa cervical cancer, but treatment results are disappointing, particularly for women with bulky tumors.

Previous findings from a clinical trial (Protocol B-06) conducted by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) indicated the worth of lumpectomy and breast irradiation for treating breast cancer. After the discovery by NSABP staff members of falsified information on patients enrolled in the study by St. Luc Hospital in Montreal, separate audits were conducted at St. Luc Hospital and other participating institutions. We report the results of both audits and update the study findings through an average of 12 years of follow-up. METHODS. Patients with either negative or positive axillary nodes and tumors 4 cm or less in diameter were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: total mastectomy, lumpectomy followed by breast irradiation, or lumpectomy without irradiation. Three cohorts of patients were analyzed. The first cohort included all 2105 randomized patients, who were analyzed according to the intention- to-treat principle. The second cohort consisted of 1851 eligible patients in the first cohort with known nodal status who agreed to be followed and who accepted their assigned therapy (among those excluded were 6 patients from St. Luc Hospital who were declared ineligible because of falsified biopsy dates). The third cohort consisted of the patients in the second cohort minus the 322 eligible patients from St. Luc Hospital (total, 1529 patients). RESULTS. Regardless of the cohort, no significant differences were found in overall survival, disease-free survival, or survival free of disease at distant sites between the patients who underwent total mastectomy and those treated by lumpectomy alone or by lumpectomy plus breast irradiation. After 12 years of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of a recurrence of tumor in the ipsilateral breast was 35 percent in the group treated with lumpectomy alone and 10 percent in the group treated with lumpectomy and breast irradiation (P &lt; 0.001).

Breast-conservation therapy for early-stage breast cancer is now an accepted treatment, but there is still controversy about its comparability with mastectomy. Between 1979 and 1987, the National Cancer Institute conducted a randomized, single-institution trial comparing lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and radiation with mastectomy and axillary dissection for stage I and II breast cancer. We update the results of that trial after a median potential follow-up of 10.1 years. METHODS. Two hundred forty-seven patients with clinical stage I and II breast cancer were randomly assigned to undergo either modified radical mastectomy or lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and radiation therapy. The 237 patients who actually underwent randomization have been followed for a median of 10.1 years. The primary end points were overall survival and disease-free survival. RESULTS. At 10 years overall survival was 75 percent for the patients assigned to mastectomy and 77 percent for those assigned to lumpectomy plus radiation (P = 0.89). Disease-free survival at 10 years was 69 percent for the patients assigned to mastectomy and 72 percent for those assigned to lumpectomy plus radiation (P = 0.93). The rate of local regional recurrence at 10 years was 10 percent after mastectomy and 5 percent after lumpectomy plus radiation (P = 0.17) after recurrences successfully treated by mastectomy were censored from the analysis. CONCLUSIONS. In the management of stage I and II breast cancer, breast conservation with lumpectomy and radiation offers results at 10 years that are equivalent to those with mastectomy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1197"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: The authors hypothesized that pancreaticogastrostomy is safer than pancreaticojejunostomy after pancreaticoduodenectomy and less likely to be associated with a postoperative pancreatic fistula. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Pancreatic fistula is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality after pancreaticoduodenectomy, occurring in 10% to 20% of patients. Nonrandomized reports have suggested that pancreaticogastrostomy is less likely than pancreaticojejunostomy to be associated with postoperative complications. METHODS: Between May 1993 and January 1995, the findings for 145 patients were analyzed in this prospective trial at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. After giving their appropriate preoperative informed consent, patients were randomly assigned to pancreaticogastrostomy or pancreaticojejunostomy after completion of the pancreaticoduodenal resection. All pancreatic anastomoses were performed in two layers without pancreatic duct stents and with closed suction drainage. Pancreatic fistula was defined as drainage of greater than 50 mL of amylase-rich fluid on or after postoperative day 10. RESULTS: The pancreaticogastrostomy (n = 73) and pancreaticojejunostomy (n = 72) groups were comparable with regard to multiple parameters, including demographics, medical history, preoperative laboratory values, and intraoperative factors, such as operative time, blood transfusions, pancreatic texture, length of pancreatic remnant mobilized, and pancreatic duct diameter. The overall incidence of pancreatic fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy was 11.7% (17/145). The incidence of pancreatic fistula was similar for the pancreaticogastrostomy (12.3%) and pancreaticojejunostomy (11.1%) groups. Pancreatic fistula was associated with a significant prolongation of postoperative hospital stay (36 +/- 5 vs. 15 +/- 1 days) (p &lt; 0.001). Factors significantly increasing the risk of pancreatic fistula by univariate logistic regression analysis included ampullary or duodenal disease, soft pancreatic texture, longer operative time, greater intraoperative red blood cell transfusions, and lower surgical volume (p &lt; 0.05). A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed the factors most highly associated with pancreatic fistula to be lower surgical volume and ampullary or duodenal disease in the resected specimen. CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic fistula is a common complication after pancreaticoduodenectomy, with an incidence most strongly associated with surgical volume and underlying disease. These data do not support the hypothesis that pancreaticogastrostomy is safer than pancreaticojejunostomy or is associated with a lower incidence of pancreatic fistula</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1201"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND. Randomized trials of radiotherapy and surgery for early breast cancer may have been too small to detect differences in long- term survival and recurrence reliably. We therefore performed a systematic overview (meta-analysis) of the results of such trials. METHODS. Information was sought on each subject from investigators who conducted trials that began before 1985 and that compared local therapies for early breast cancer. Data on mortality were available from 36 trials comparing radiotherapy plus surgery with the same type of surgery alone, 10 comparing more extensive surgery with less extensive surgery, and 18 comparing more extensive surgery with less extensive surgery plus radiotherapy. Information on mortality was available for 28,405 women (97.4 percent of the 29,175 women in the trials). RESULTS. The addition of radiotherapy to surgery resulted in a rate of local recurrence that was three times lower than the rate with surgery alone, but there was no significant difference in 10-year survival; among a total of 17,273 women enrolled in such trials, mortality was 40.3 percent with radiotherapy and 41.4 percent without radiotherapy (P = 0.3). Radiotherapy was associated with a reduced risk of death due to breast cancer (odds ratio, 0.94; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.88 to 1.00; P = 0.03), which indicates that, after 10 years, there would be about 0 to 5 fewer deaths due to breast cancer per 100 women. However, there was an increased risk of death from other causes (odds ratio, 1.24; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.42; P = 0.002). This, together with the age-specific death rates, implies, after 10 years, a few extra deaths not due to breast cancer per 100 older women or per 1000 younger women. During the first decade or two after diagnosis, the excess in the rate of such deaths that was associated with radiotherapy was much greater women who were over 60 years of age at randomization (15.3 percent vs. 11.1 percent [339 vs. 249 deaths]) than among those under 50 (2.5 percent vs. 2.0 percent [62 vs. 49 deaths]). Breast-conserving surgery involved some risk of recurrence in the remaining tissue, but no significant differences in overall survival at 10 years were found in the studies of mastectomy versus breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy (4891 women), more extensive surgery versus less extensive surgery (4818 women), or axillary clearance versus radiotherapy as adjuncts to mastectomy (4370 women). CONCLUSIONS. Some of the local therapies for breast cancer had substantially different effects on the rates of local recurrence--such as the reduced recurrence with the addition of radiotherapy to surgery-- but there were no definite differences in overall survival at 10 years</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="2"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Definitive chemoradiation (CR) has replaced radical surgery as the preferred treatment of epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal. To determine the importance of mitomycin (MMC) in the standard CR regimen and to assess the role of salvage CR in patients who have residual tumor following CR, a phase III randomized trial was undertaken by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between August 1988 and December 1991, 310 patients were randomized to receive either radiotherapy (RT) and fluorouracil (5-FU) or radiotherapy, 5-FU, and MMC. Of 291 assessable patients, 145 received 45 to 50.4 Gy of pelvic RT plus 5-FU at 1,000 mg/m2/d for 4 days, and 146 received RT, 5-FU, and MMC (10 mg/m2 per dose for two doses). Patients with residual tumor on posttreatment biopsy were treated with a salvage regimen that consisted of additional pelvic RT (9 Gy), 5-FU, and cisplatin (100 mg/m2). RESULTS: Posttreatment biopsies were positive in 15% of patients in the 5-FU arm versus 7.7% in the MMC arm (P = .135). At 4 years, colostomy rates were lower (9% v 22%; P = .002), colostomy-free survival higher (71% v 59%; P = .014), and disease-free survival higher (73% v 51%; P = .0003) in the MMC arm. A significant difference in overall survival has not been observed at 4 years. Toxicity was greater in the MMC arm (23% v 7% grade 4 and 5 toxicity; P &lt; or = .001). Of 24 assessable patients who underwent salvage CR, 12 (50%) were rendered disease-free. CONCLUSION: Despite greater toxicity, the use of MMC in a definitive CR regimen for anal cancer is justified, particularly in patients with large primary tumors. Salvage CR should be attempted in patients with residual disease following definitive CR before resorting to radical surgery</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="3"><COL><DATA>BACKGROUND: Non-surgical management of anal cancer by radiotherapy alone or combined with chemotherapy has, in uncontrolled studies, yielded similar local tumour control and survival rates to surgery. However, whether the addition of chemotherapy improves outcome without adding to morbidity is not known. Our trial was designed to compare combined modality therapy (CMT) with radiotherapy alone in patients with epidermoid anal cancer. METHODS: From 856 patients considered for entry to our multicentre trial, 585 patients were randomised to receive initially either 45 Gy radiotherapy in twenty or twenty-five fractions over 4-5 weeks (290 patients) or the same regimen of radiotherapy combined with 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 for 4 days or 750 mg/m2 for 5 days) by continuous infusion during the first and the final weeks of radiotherapy and mitomycin (12 mg/m2) on day 1 of the first course (295 patients). We assessed clinical response 6 weeks after initial treatment: good responders were recommended for boost radiotherapy and poor responders for salvage surgery. The main endpoint was local-failure rate (&gt; or = 6 weeks after initial treatment); secondary endpoints were overall and cause-specific survival. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. FINDINGS: In the radiotherapy and CMT arms, respectively, five and three were ineligible, and six and nine died 6 weeks after initial treatment. After a median follow-up of 42 months (interquartile range 28-62), 164 of 279 (59%) radiotherapy patients had a local failure compared with 101 of 283 (36%) CMT patients. This gave a 46% reduction in the risk of local failure in the patients receiving CMT (relative risk 0.54, 95% CI 0.42-0.69, p &lt; 0.0001). The risk of death from anal cancer was also reduced in the CMT arm (0.71, 0.53-0.95, p = 0.02). There was no overall survival advantage (0.86, 0.67-1.11, p = 0.25). Early morbidity was significantly more frequent in the CMT arm (p = 0.03), but late morbidity occurred at similar rates. INTERPRETATION: Our trial shows that the standard treatment for most patients with epidermoid anal cancer should be a combination of radiotherapy and infused 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin, with surgery reserved for those who fall on this regimen</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="21"><COL><DATA> Prognostic factors predicting for breast recurrence following breast conserving surgery and radiotherapy have been identified in a prospective randomised trial comparing two different radiotherapy techniques. The first used megavoltage radiation to encompass the whole breast and regional nodes (WF group). The second used an electron field directed to the tumour bed only (LF group). With a median follow up of 8 years survival in both groups was the same (72%). There was an increased rate of breast recurrence in the LF group: 25%, compared to the WF group: 13% (P = 0.00008), expressed in actuarial terms at 8 years.

A prospectively randomised study was therefore undertaken to compare relative clinical efficacy of fadrozole as first-line treatment to that of tamoxifen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty postmenopausal women who had not received prior treatment for advanced/metastatic breast cancer were randomised to receive either fadrozole, 1 mg twice daily, or tamoxifen, 20 mg daily. RESULTS: Toxicity was not statistically different on the two treatment arms. Only mild to moderate toxicity was documented: hot flashes in 37%, headaches in 6.5%, mild fatigue in 2.6%. There were also no statistically significant differences in objective response rates, survival or time to treatment failure (TTF). Objective response rate on fadrozole was 50% (complete response (CR) 8.3% and partial response (PR) 42%). On tamoxifen objective response was 44.7% (CR 21% and PR 24%). Median TTF was 4.9 months on fadrozole and 5 months on tamoxifen. Median survival was 22.7 months on fadrozole and 27.5 months on tamoxifen.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred twelve eligible patients were randomized to receive tamoxifen 20 mg daily, or fadrozole 1 mg twice daily orally until disease progression or the advent of undue toxicity. The treatments were to be discontinued upon disease progression. RESULTS: Prognostic factors were well balanced between the treatment groups, except for sites of metastatic disease. Fadrozole-treated patients had significantly more visceral, especially liver, involvement and less bone-dominant disease. Response rates for fadrozole and tamoxifen were similar, 20% and 27% (95% Confidence Limits (CL): 13%-29% and 21%-35%), respectively. Time to treatment failure was longer in patients randomized to tamoxifen (8.5 months for tamoxifen vs. 6.1 months for fadrozole), but did not reach statistical significance after adjustment for prognostic factors (P = 0.09). Fadrozole, for which a significantly lower percentage of clinically relevant toxic effects (WHO toxicity grade &gt; or = 2) was recorded (27% vs. 13%, respectively; P = 0.009), was better tolerated than tamoxifen. Severe cardiovascular events including 3 fatalities were seen only in patients treated with tamoxifen. Eighty-two patients crossed over to tamoxifen and 66 patients to fadrozole. Crossover endocrine therapy led to response or stable disease in 64% of the patients. The overall survival times of the two treatment groups were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Fadrozole and tamoxifen showed similar efficacy as first-line treatments in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer. Fadrozole was significantly better tolerated and may therefore be an appropriate alternative to tamoxifen, especially for patients predisposed to thromboembolic events</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="24"><COL><DATA> The activity of paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) in advanced breast cancer patients who have failed doxorubicin treatment is well established, but the optimal sequence between these two important agents remains to be determined.

Two features have limited its clinical utility: tendency to elicit kidney failure and inability to produce complete analgesia. Because most NSAIDs are weak acids (pKa 3-5) and become concentrated in acidic tissues, such as injured and inflamed tissues, we hypothesized that local administration may enhance its analgesic efficacy while lowering the potential for systemic complications. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled study of 60 group I-II (American Society of Anesthesiology criteria) mastectomy patients, 20 in each group. Near the end of surgery and every 6 h postoperatively, 20 ml of the study solution containing normal saline with or without 30 mg of ketorolac were administered simultaneously either via a Jackson-Pratt drain or intravenously in a double-blind fashion. The quality of pain control, the amount and character of the drain fluid, incidence of nausea and vomiting, length of stay in the postoperative care unit, and amount of morphine used for treatment of break-through pain were recorded. RESULTS: Intraoperative administration of ketorolac resulted in better quality of pain control in the immediate postoperative period regardless of route of administration. The incidence of nausea was significantly higher in the placebo group, and drain output in the ketorolac groups did not exceed the output in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Analgesic of the locally administered ketorolac is equally effective to the efficacy of ketorolac administered intravenously</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="26"><COL><DATA> The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the new aromatase inhibitor &apos;ARIMIDEX&apos; (anastrozole) with megestrol acetate in the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Anastrozole is a new potent and highly selective non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor. We conducted a prospective randomised trial comparing two doses of anastrozole (1 and 10 mg orally once daily) with megestrol acetate (40 mg orally four times daily) in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer who progressed after prior tamoxifen therapy. All patients were analysed for efficacy as randomised (intention to treat) and for tolerability as per treatment received. Of the 378 patients who entered the study, 135 were randomised to anastrozole 1 mg, 118 to anastrozole 10 mg, and 125 patients to megestrol acetate. After a median follow-up of 192 days, response rate which included complete response, partial response and patients who had disease stabilisation for 6 months or more was 34% for anastrozole 1 mg, 33.9% for anastrozole 10 mg and 32.8% for megestrol acetate. There were no statistically significant differences between either dose of anastrozole and megestrol acetate in terms of objective response rate, time to objective progression of disease or time to treatment failure. The three treatments were generally well tolerated, but more patients on megestrol acetate reported weight gain, oedema and dyspnoea as adverse events while more patients on anastrozole reported gastro-intestinal disorders, usually in the form of mild transient nausea. Patients on anastrozole did not report higher incidences of oestrogen withdrawal symptoms. Anastrozole is an effective and well tolerated treatment for postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer. The higher 10 mg dose did not result in additional clinical benefit, but was well tolerated reflecting the good therapeutic margin with anastrozole. Based on this data, anastrozole 1 mg should be the recommended therapeutic dose</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="27"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE. Long-term outcome of comparison of mastectomy with axillary clearance to mastectomy without it. DESIGN. Second analysis of a terminated prospective randomised trial. SETTING. The Breast Clinic, Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town. PATIENTS. Ninety-five women aged under 76 years with stages 1 and 2 (T1-2 NO-1 MO) breast cancer. INTERVENTIONS. Radical mastectomy (mastectomy and formal axillary dissection with pectoral muscle excision) or simple mastectomy (mastectomy without axillary dissection if nodes were not clinically palpable, or local excision of the nodes if they were). OUTCOME MEASURES. Loco-regional recurrence and survival. RESULTS. Whereas initial analysis at 40 months had showed more axillary recurrences (P = 0.056) in the simple mastectomy group (leading to the termination of the trial), this difference has disappeared at 10 years (P = 0.113). There was no difference in rate of recurrence at all other sites, time to recurrence, or survival rates at 40 months or at 10 or 25 years. CONCLUSIONS. Full axillary clearance offered no better long-term loco-regional control or survival.

Fadrozole hydrochloride (CGS-16949A) belongs to the class of aromatase inhibitors that lowers circulating estrogen levels by inhibiting the conversion of androgens to estrogens, thereby causing tumor regression in patients with breast carcinoma. METHODS. This was a prospective, randomized, Phase II study of fadrozole hydrochloride in postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast carcinoma. The three treatment groups received, respectively, fadrozole hydrochloride 0.6 mg three times daily, 1 mg twice daily, and 2 mg twice daily orally. RESULTS. Fifty-six patients were entered on protocol and 54 were eligible (2 patients were perimenopausal). Eight patients had received no prior therapy, 15 patients had received prior hormonal therapy, 5 patients had received prior chemotherapy, and 28 patients had received both. After 12 weeks of treatment, 2 complete and 3 partial responses were observed. Forty patients continued treatment beyond 12 weeks, and 3 additional responses were achieved. Thus, 8 of 56 patients responded (14% overall response rate). Responses did not appear to be dose-related. The median duration of response was 36 months (range, 8-45 months). Subjective toxicity was mild to moderate and appeared more frequent on the 2 mg twice daily dosing schedule. No objective toxicity in laboratory parameters was observed. No patient had severe or life-threatening toxicity. Fadrozole hydrochloride plasma concentrations (obtained every 2 weeks for 12 weeks) appeared to be dose-dependent and noncumulative. CONCLUSIONS.

Fifty-three patients were randomized to receive either PIXY321. 375 microg/m2 twice a day subcutaneously, or GM-CSF, 250 microg/m2 daily subcutaneously after FLAC chemotherapy. PIXY321 was less well tolerated than GM-CSF, with more patients developing chills and local skin reactions and more patients stopping PIXY321 due to intolerance. While no difference in the neutrophil nadirs was seen with the two cytokines, the duration of the absolute neutrophil count less than 1,000/muL for all cycles was significantly longer with PIXY321 than with GM-CSF. Fifty percent of patients treated with multiple cycles of FLAC chemotherapy on both study arms developed dose-limiting thrombocytopenia. No differences in platelet nadirs, duration of thrombocytopenia, or need for platelet transfusions were observed with PIXY321 versus GM-CSF. The average delivered doses of FLAC chemotherapy were somewhat higher in the GM-CSF study arm.

The efficacy and safety of an aromatase inhibitor, fadrozole HCL, were compared with megestrol acetate in post menopausal patients who had disease progression after receiving antiestrogen therapy either for metastatic disease or as adjuvant therapy. METHODS: In 2 multiinstitutional prospective trials, 683 postmenopausal patients were randomized to receive either fadrozole HCL, 1 mg twice daily, or megestrol acetate, 40 mg 4 times daily, in a double blind fashion after progression on first-line hormonal therapy. Objective response rates, time to progression, survival and safety of the two regimens were compared. RESULTS: Results of intent-to-treat analyses are presented in this study. No significant differences were detected between the two treatment groups in time to progression, objective response rates, duration of response, and survival in either trial. There were no clinically meaningful differences between the treatment groups in the incidence and severity of adverse experiences, except that weight gain, fluid retention, and dyspnea were observed in more patients in the megestrol acetate group compared with those receiving fadrozole HCL, whereas nausea and vomiting were observed in more patients in the fadrozole HCL group compared with those receiving megestrol acetate. CONCLUSIONS: Fadrozole HCL was as efficacious as megestrol acetate in postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast carcinoma after one hormonal therapy. Adverse experiences were mild with both therapies, but megestrol acetate was associated wiht a higher frequency of weight gain, fluid retention and dyspnea, whereas fadrozole HCL was associated with a higher frequency of nausea and vomiting</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="31"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: The strength of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is that they allow investigators to draw reliable inferences about treatment differences; physicians can then make a choice between different options. Their weakness is that they are conducted on a set of patients who cannot be regarded as a random sample from the population that will be treated outside the trial. Observational data collected in a prospective clinical database may provide more realistic estimates. METHODS: At the Istituto Nazionale de Tumori of Milan an RCT was started in 1973 (MI1) in which Halsted mastectomy was compared with quadrantectomy plus axillary dissection and radiotherapy (QUART), a breast conserving treatment, for &quot;early-stage&quot; primary breast cancer. In addition, a prospective clinical database was established to collect, in standard format, information on all women undergoing breast conservation thereafter and followed up at the Institute. 1760 women were treated with QUART, 350 of them being accrued in the years 1973-80 in the context of the MI1 trial. The remaining 1408 received QUART after the MI1 trial, up to December, 1984. RESULTS: In the years after the trial, the criteria for use of QUART became more liberal. However, after adjustment for baseline characteristics, out-trial patients fared no worse than trial patients in terms of survival or distant metastasis. Out-trial patients did have a slightly higher rate of local recurrence, probably because of subtle and multiple changes in the surgical procedures since the time of the trial.

The 12-cycle CMF group (91 patients) received, 100 mg CPA orally on days 1 to 14 plus 20 mg MTX and 500 mg 5-FU intravenously (iv) on days 1 and 8 of each cycle.

However, approximately 30% of affected patients present new disease manifestations within 10 years after surgery. To test the hypothesis that node-negative and estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer patients can benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, a prospective randomized study was activated at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori of Milan in 1980. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted in 90 patients operated on for unilateral breast cancer who were then assigned to receive either 12 intravenous cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF) every three weeks, or no further treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered in the outpatient clinic of the Division of Medical Oncology. Patient characteristics were fairly well balanced between the two treatment groups except for primary tumor size: 58% of those with a primary tumor measuring &gt; 2 cm in its largest diameter were randomized in the control group compared with 38% in the CMF regimen (P = 0.06). RESULTS: At 12 years after surgery treatment outcome was significantly superior for patients given adjuvant CMF. The relapse-free survival rate was 71% (95% confidence limits (CL): 56-86) versus 43% (95% CL: 28-58), and total survival was 80% (95% CL: 68-92) versus 50% (95% CL: 34-66), respectively. The benefit from the administration of CMF was evident in all patient subsets and was not influenced by menopausal status.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 142 women with stage II and III breast cancer were to receive four 21-day cycles of chemotherapy that consisted of fluorouracil 600 mg/ m2 intravenously (IV), doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 IV, and cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 IV on day 1, followed by placebo or GM-CSF 250 micrograms/m2/d daily subcutaneously (SC) on days 3 through 15. All patients received prophylactic ciprofloxacin by mouth when the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was less than 1,000/microL. RESULTS: Eighty-six percent of GM-CSF patients (n = 62) and 96% of placebo patients (n = 69) completed four assessable cycles of treatment on study. Overall, the median duration of severe neutropenia (ANC &lt; 500/microL) was 2.8 days with GM-CSF and 6.8 days with placebo (P &lt; .001); the duration of ANC less than 1,000/microL was 6.0 versus 9.1 days, respectively (P &lt; .001). Hospitalizations for febrile neutropenia were uncommon in either group: GM-CSF, six; placebo, eight. The only other difference in hematologic toxicity was grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia observed with greater frequency in GM-CSF patients than placebo patients in cycles 3 and 4. GM-CSF increased mean the FAC dose-intensity among patients who completed two or more cycles (P &lt; .001). GM-CSF was generally well tolerated and associated with more injection-site reactions, but less mucositis than placebo. There were no deaths on study. CONCLUSION: GM-CSF significantly enhanced ANC recovery after FAC chemotherapy; it decreased the incidence and duration of associated neutropenia and moderately increased the dose-intensity of adjuvant chemotherapy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From May 1991 to May 1993, 207 patients were enrolled onto this study and randomized to receive intravenous (IV) EPI (60 mg/m2 on days 1 and 2) alone or with LND (600 mg orally daily). EPI administration was repeated every 21 days until tumor progression or for a maximum of eight cycles. LND was administered continuously until chemotherapy withdrawal. RESULTS: Response rate was significantly superior for the EPI plus LND scheme compared with the single-agent EPI either considering assessable patients (60.0% v 39.8%; P &lt; .01) or including all registered patients according to an intention-to-treat analysis (55.3% v 37.5%; P &lt; .02). The distribution of the response rate according to the site of disease did not show any significant difference between the treatment arms, except for the patient subgroup with liver metastases in which the combination EPI plus LND resulted in a significant improvement of responses than EPI alone. Toxicity was moderate, and except for myalgia, no adjunctive side effects were observed in the EPI plus LND arm. Overall survival and time to progression were similar in both groups.

Five patients died in the early post-operative period at a mean of 16 days (in-hospital mortality 5%) allowing detailed follow up on the remaining 95 patients who were followed up to death or for a minimum of 36 months. A stapled anastomosis was quicker to perform (P &lt; 0.001), resulting in a shorter operative time (P &lt; 0.005) and was associated with decreased blood loss (P &lt; 0.05). The number of anastomotic leaks, length of in-patient stay, stricture formation and survival in the two groups was not statistically different. A stapled oesophagogastric anastomosis fulfills all of the requirements for routine use in thoracic surgical practice when performing oesophageal resection for carcinoma of the distal oesophagus or gastric cardia. It is quick to perform allowing a shorter operating time and lower blood loss and does not appear to be associated with a previously noted increased incidence of benign anastomotic stricture formation when compared with handsewn anastomoses</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="168"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Mechanical anastomosis has been claimed to reduce the rate of leakage compared with manual anastomosis. No randomized trials have been performed to date to prove this specifically in esophagogastric anastomosis. METHODS: One hundred fifty-four patients, 139 men and 15 women ranging in age from 36 to 83 years (mean, 50 +/- 10 years) and undergoing elective resection of esophageal or cardial carcinoma, were included in this multiinstitutional (14 centers) randomized study comparing the rate of anastomotic leakage after esophagogastric anastomosis performed manually or mechanically. Eligible for this study were patients with esophageal or cardial carcinoma located between the esophagogastric junction (included) and the upper border of the aortic arch. The choice between resection with or without thoracotomy was left to the discretion of the operating surgeon. Proximal resection of the fundus was mandatory. Intestinal tract continuity was reestablished in a one-stage procedure by an esophagogastric anastomosis without interposition of either the jejunum or the colon. The site of the anastomosis could be either intrathoracic or cervical. The principal end point was anastomotic leakage as judged by (1) egress of intestinal fluids or orally ingested methylene blue through drains, (2) sodium diatrozate swallow prescribed either routinely for all patients between postoperative days 3 and 8 or because of signs of leakage, or (3) reoperation or autopsy. RESULTS: After two patients were withdrawn for protocol violation, 152 patients, 74 in the manual group and 78 in the mechanical group, were studied. The number of anastomotic leakages was identical in both groups (n = 12, 16% and 15%, respectively). Overall 30-day mortality was 11%. Fewer deaths occurred in the manual group (7%), which had three anastomotic leakages, than in the mechanical group (15%), which had five anastomotic leakages, and fewer repeat operations were done in the manual group (n = 9) than in the mechanical group (n = 13), but both of these differences were not statistically significant. The duration of anastomosis and of operation was similar in both groups. In the mechanical group 16 anastomoses (20%) gave rise to technical mishaps (either in the fashioning of the purse-string, dilation of the esophagus, or in stapling). Among the factors recognized as potentially preventing leakage, only testing for airtightness was significantly correlated with less postoperative leakage (p &lt; 0.05). Eight postoperative strictures were recorded at 3 months in 62 (13%) patients in the manual group, whereas seven strictures occurred in 53 (13%) patients in the mechanical group. CONCLUSIONS: When mechanical staples rather than manual sutures are chosen, the disadvantages (technical mishaps and higher costs) are not counterbalanced by a gain of time or a decrease in the rate or severity of anastomotic leakage</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="169"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled studies suggest that a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy improves the survival of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. We conducted a prospective, randomized trial comparing surgery alone with combined chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. METHODS: Patients assigned to multimodal therapy received two courses of chemotherapy in weeks 1 and 6 (fluorouracil, 15 mg per kilogram of body weight daily for five days, and cisplatin, 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area on day 7) and a course of radiotherapy (40 Gy, administered in 15 fractions over a three-week period, beginning concurrently with the first course of chemotherapy), followed by surgery. The patients assigned to surgery had no preoperative therapy. RESULTS: Of the 58 patients assigned to multimodal therapy and the 55 assigned to surgery, 10 and 1, respectively, were withdrawn for protocol violations. At the time of surgery, 23 of 55 patients (42 percent) treated with preoperative multimodal therapy who could be evaluated had positive nodes or metastases, as compared with 45 of the 55 patients (82 percent) who underwent surgery alone (P&lt;0.001). Thirteen of the 52 patients (25 percent) who underwent surgery after multimodal therapy had complete responses as determined pathologically. The median survival of patients assigned to multimodal therapy was 16 months, as compared with 11 months for those assigned to surgery alone (P=0.01). At one, two, and three years, 52, 37, and 32 percent, respectively, of patients assigned to multimodal therapy were alive, as compared with 44, 26, and 6 percent of those assigned to surgery, with the survival advantage favoring multimodal therapy reaching significance at three years (P=0.01).

Reports on the efficacy of preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy are conflicting or have included limited disease or radical surgery alone. OBJECTIVE: The authors&apos; objective was to study the results of chemotherapy on the duration and quality of survival in patients who have undergone palliative surgical resection for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 124 patients with histologically proven esophageal squamous cell carcinoma situated more than 5 cm from the upper end of the esophagus, 4 patients were withdrawn for failure to comply with the protocol. The remaining 120 patients, 116 males and 4 females (mean age, 57 +/- 9 years), were randomly assigned to either a control group who were to receive no chemotherapy (68 patients) or to a group who were to be treated with chemotherapy (52 patients). Patients were subdivided into two strata as follows: (1) stratum I, complete resection of the tumor with lymph node involvement (62 patients) and (2) stratum ii, incomplete resection leaving macroscopic tumor tissue in situ or with metastases. Noninclusion criteria were histologically proven tracheobronchial involvement, esotracheal fistula, major alteration of general health status (Karnofsky score &lt;50), cerebral or extensive (&gt;30% of parenchyma) hepatic metastasis, peritoneal carcinomatosis, associated or previously treated upper airway cancer, or, conversely, complete resection of tumor without lymph node involvement. Chemotherapy was given in 5-day courses, every 28 days, with a maximum of 8 courses. Cisplatin was administered either as a single dose of 100 mg/m2 at the beginning of the course or as 20 mg/m2/day for 5 days given over 3 hours. 5- Fluorouracil (5-FU) (100 mg/m2/day) was infused over 24 hours for 5 days. The duration of treatment ranged from 6 to 8 months. The main aim was to establish median survival and actuarial survival curves. The subsidiary aim was to evaluate quality of survival as judged by complications due to treatment and the duration of autonomous oral feeding, that is, without palliative endoscopic treatment. No difference in survival was noted between the two groups, overall (median, 14 months), or between the strata. Conversely, significantly more patients in the treated group had hematologic, neurologic, and renal complications compared with the control group. Four patients died of complications of chemotherapy. The duration of autonomous oral alimentation was exactly the same in both groups (median, 12 + months). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that 5-FU and cisplatin are not useful for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who have not undergone curative resection</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="225"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To investigate if double modulation of fluorouracil (5-FU) with leucovorin (folinic acid [FA]) and interferon alfa-2b (IFN 2b) improves responses and survival in comparison to single modulation of 5-FU with FA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred six patients with histologically confirmed advanced colorectal cancer, measurable disease, and without previous chemotherapy were prospectively randomized into two groups. Patients in group A received 5-FU 450 mg/m2 as an intravenous bolus in the midinfusion of FA weekly. FA was given at a dose of 200 mg/m2 in 500 mL 0.9% normal saline solution in 2-hour infusion. Patients in group B received exactly the same regimen plus IFN 2b 5 million units subcutaneously three times weekly. RESULTS: All patients were well balanced in both groups regarding age, sex, performance status, number, and site of metastasis. One hundred two patients were assessable. All patients have died. There was no difference in response between the two groups (7.8% v 9.8%). Median survival was 10.1 months in group A, and 7.2 months in group B (P = .00189). Median time to progression was 8.4 and 5.2 months, respectively (P = .00196). Overall, better performance status and older age had a positive impact on survival. Toxicity was the most important and catastrophic aspect of this study. Patients who received IFN 2b had significantly worse anemia, neutropenia, diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss, flu-like syndrome, and psychological reactions. CONCLUSION: Based on this final analysis, the addition of IFN 2b to the combination of 5-FU and FA enhances toxicity and contributes to decreased survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="243"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To find out whether short-term high-dose preoperative radiotherapy can reduce local recurrence rate without increasing postoperative mortality in patients with resectable rectal cancer. DESIGN: Randomised trial. SETTING: Nationwide Swedish multicentre trial. SUBJECTS: From March 1987 to February 1990, 1168 patients were randomised. In each group, 454 patients had curative surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were allocated to preoperative irradiation (25 Gy in five fractions in one week) followed by operation within a week, or to surgery alone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative morbidity and mortality, and local recurrence rate. RESULTS: After a minimum follow-up of two years, 9% (51/553) of the patients in the irradiated group who had had the tumour resected had developed a local recurrence, compared with 24% (131/557) in the surgery alone group (p &lt; 0.001). In patients who underwent curative operations, the local recurrence rates were 7% (33/454) and 20% (93/454), respectively (p &lt; 0.001). The corresponding figures for all patients with Dukes&apos; stage tumours were: A 3% (6/181) and 9% (14/154) (p = 0.04); Dukes&apos; stage B 7% (14/195) and 18% (31/173), (p &lt; 0.01) and Dukes&apos; stage C 18% (31/177) and 37% (86/ 230), (p &lt; 0.001), respectively.

The aim of this study was to find out whether local recurrence rate could be reduced and survival increased by a moderately high dose of preoperative radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced, but otherwise operable, carcinoma of the rectum. METHODS: We carried out a prospective randomised trial of surgery alone (n = 140) versus surgery preceded by 40 Gy radiotherapy (n = 139) given in 20 fractions of 2 Gy over 4 weeks. The patients, from 20 regional centres throughout the UK, were enrolled between 1981 and 1989, and followed up for a minimum of 5 years or to death. FINDINGS: 217 patients died, 114 of 140 allocated surgery alone and 103 of 139 allocated preoperative radiotherapy: median survival times were 24 months and 31 months, respectively. The hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.79 (95% CI 0.60-1.04, p = 0.10). At 5 years&apos; follow-up 65 patients allocated surgery alone and 50 who received preoperative radiotherapy had local recurrence (hazard ratio 0.68 [0.47-0.98], p = 0.04); the corresponding numbers of patients with distant recurrence were 67 and 49 (hazard ratio 0.66 [0.46-0.95], p = 0.02). There was a significant benefit of radiotherapy on disease-free survival (hazard ratio 0.76 [0.58-1.0], p = 0.05). There was no increase in postoperative or late complications in the radiotherapy group. INTERPRETATION: Our results provide further evidence that preoperative radiotherapy can reduce the rate of local recurrence of rectal cancer in patients with locally advanced disease. However, survival results are still equivocal, and so we must await the results of a meta-analysis of all radiotherapy trials from which precise and definitive results, particularly for survival, may be obtained</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="247"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Although surgery is the treatment of choice for rectal cancer, local recurrence is common even after apparently curative resection. We aimed to assess the role of postoperative radiotherapy in reducing rates of local recurrence, and improving disease-free and overall survival in patients with mobile Dukes&apos; stage B and C rectal cancers. METHODS: We carried out a prospective, randomised trial of surgery alone (n = 235) versus surgery followed 4-6 weeks later by radiotherapy (n = 234), of 40 Gy in 20 fractions of 2 Gy over 4 weeks. The 469 patients, from 46 hospitals in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, were randomised between 1984 and 1989, and followed up for a minimum of 5 years or to death. FINDINGS: 284 patients died, 145 of 235 allocated surgery alone and 139 of 234 allocated postoperative radiotherapy. The hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.84 (95% CI 0.65-1.07, p = 0.17). At 5 years&apos; follow-up 79 patients who received surgery alone and 48 who received postoperative radiotherapy had had local recurrence (hazard ratio 0.54 [0.38-0.77], p = 0.001). The corresponding numbers with distant recurrence were 83 and 75 (hazard ratio 0.85 [0.63-1.114], p = 0.18). The hazard ratio for disease-free survival was 0.85 (0.65-1.08; p = 0.18). Radiotherapy was generally well tolerated; assessment of late events showed serious late bowel complications to be rare and not significantly increased after radiotherapy, even when this followed anterior resection. INTERPRETATION: Our results have provided further evidence of the ability of postoperative radiotherapy to delay and prevent local recurrence of rectal cancer. Although the local recurrence rate in the control group is in keeping with other multi-centre trials of the mid to late 1980s, it is undoubtedly higher than would be regarded as acceptable now.

Five hundred fifty-seven patients from 12 institutions were included with histologically proven, clinically resectable rectal adenocarcinoma. Patients planned for local excision or previously irradiated to the pelvis were excluded. METHODS: A total of 272 patients were allocated to preoperative irradiation with 25 Gy in five cycles during 5-7 days to the rectum and the pararectal tissues (RT+ group) and 285 patients were allocated to surgery only (RT- group). The median follow-up time was 50 months. No patient was lost to follow-up. Surgery was considered curative in 479 patients (86%). RESULTS: Locoregional recurrence occurred in 10% of the patients in the RT+ group versus 21% in the RT- group (p &lt; 0.01). Among the curatively operated patients, distant metastases occurred in 19% in the RT+ group versus 26% in the RT- group (p = 0.02). The overall survival was improved in the irradiated patients (p = 0.02). Postoperative complications were more common after irradiation but were usually mild. The postoperative mortality was low in both groups.

However, the combined therapy is associated with more toxic effects, raising the question of whether the benefits of the treatment justify its quality-of-life costs for the individual patient. PURPOSE: To assess the trade-offs between improved survival and increased treatment toxicity, we reanalyzed data from a randomized clinical trial that compared the efficacy of combined adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy with adjuvant radiation therapy alone in the treatment of patients with poor-prognosis resectable rectal cancer. METHODS: The data were from a North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial in which 204 patients with poor-prognosis rectal cancer were randomly assigned to receive either postoperative radiation therapy alone or radiation therapy plus fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. A quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (Q-TWiST) analysis was used to account for freedom from symptomatic disease and from early and late side effects of treatment. All reported P values are two-sided. RESULTS: As reported previously, the combined therapy reduced the risk of relapse by 34% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 12%-50%; P = .0016) and reduced the overall death rate by 29% (95% CI = 7%-45%; P = .025) in comparison with adjuvant radiation therapy alone. In the 5 years following assignment to treatment, patients who received the combined therapy had more time with toxicity (3.1 months; 95% CI = 2.0-4.1 months), shorter survival after relapse (3.6 months less; 95% CI = 0.9-6.3 months less), and more TWiST (6.1 months; 95% CI = 0.2-12.0 months) than patients who received adjuvant radiation therapy alone. Despite an increase in the amount of time that individuals spent with early and late toxic effects, the Q-TWiST analysis indicated that the combined therapy conferred significantly greater benefit for a wide range of patient preferences about living with the toxicity of treatment or the symptoms of overt disease. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Use of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy as an adjuvant to surgery for patients with poor-prognosis resectable rectal cancer is justified, since the improved outcome in terms of delayed recurrence and increased survival balances the time spent with early and late toxic effects. The Q-TWiST method is an excellent way to compare treatment outcomes that include quality-of-life considerations</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="277"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE. The authors compared clinical bowel function and complications of a low anterior resection with either a straight or colonic J pouch anastomosis. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA. Urgency and frequent bowel movements after rectal resection with a low anastomosis have been related to the loss of rectal reservoir function. Reconstruction with a colonic J pouch possibly can obviate some of this dysfunction. Earlier reports have been favorable, but they must be verified in randomized trials. METHOD. One hundred patients with rectal cancer in whom a sphincter-saving procedure was appropriate were randomized to reconstruction with either a straight or a colonic J pouch anastomosis. RESULTS. The incidence of symptomatic anastomotic leakage was lower in the pouch group (2% vs. 15%, p = 0.03). Eighty-nine patients could be evaluated after 1 year. The pouch patients had significantly fewer bowel movements per 24 hours, and less nocturnal evacuations, urgency, and incontinence. Overall well-being owing to the bowel function was rated significantly higher by the pouch patients. CONCLUSION. Reconstruction with a colonic J pouch was associated with a lower incidence of anastomotic leakage and better clinical bowel function when compared with the traditional straight anastomosis. Functional superiority was especially evident during the first 2 months</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="279"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Functional outcome after low anterior resection with ultralow coloanal anastomosis for rectal cancer is improved by construction of a colonic J-pouch vs. straight anastomosis. Optimum size of this pouch has yet to be determined. Therefore, we initiated a prospective, randomized trial using 5-cm and 10-cm pouches to determine this size. METHODS: Patients with tumors 5 to 10 cm from the anal verge were included in the study. Before a low anterior resection anastomosis was performed, patients were randomized to either a 5-cm J-pouch group (5-J group) or a 10-cm J-pouch group (10-J group). Functional assessments were performed one year postoperatively. Clinical functions were evaluated using a functional scoring system. Physiologic functions, such as sphincter and reservoir function, were evaluated by anorectal manometry and evacuation function by the balloon expulsion and saline evacuation tests. RESULTS: Forty patients among 43 randomized patients were assessed for functional outcome one year postoperatively (5-J group, n = 20; 10-J group, n = 20). The functional score was similar for the two groups, although reservoir function in the 5-J group was significantly less than in the 10-J group. Sphincter function was similar between the two groups. Evacuation function in the 5-J group was significantly superior to that in the 10-J group.

At 1 year after low anterior resection, a bowel function questionnaire was administered and anorectal physiology tests were performed. Patients with a straight anastomosis had significantly more frequent stools (median 6 (range 3-7) daily) compared with those who had a pouch (median 3 (range 2-7) daily; P = 0.02). A frequent sensation of incomplete defaecation was found in three patients with a straight anastomosis compared with ten who had a pouch anastomosis (P = 0.02). The mean resting anal pressures were lower after colonic pouch anastomosis (P = 0.049) but there were no differences in anal squeeze pressure, rectal sensation, volume of first sensation and compliance between the two groups. The decreased stool frequency with an 8-cm colonic pouch was not associated with measured improvements in rectal reservoir function.

In addition, the possible late adverse effects of this treatment are largely unknown. METHODS: The present study was based on 1027 curatively operated patients included in 2 prospective randomized trials of preoperative radiotherapy for rectal carcinoma patients (Stockholm I and Stockholm II Trials). The goal was to assess whether long term intercurrent morbidity and mortality were increased in patients allocated to the preoperative treatment. A computerized linkage of the randomized patients to a population-based registry of the Stockholm County Council was used to study hospital admissions for six groups of a priori defined diseases, putatively related to late adverse effects of the radiation. RESULTS: Preoperative radiotherapy significantly increased the incidence of venous thromboembolism (P = 0.01), femoral neck and pelvic fractures (P = 0.03), intestinal obstruction (P = 0.02), and postoperative fistulas (P = 0.01). For arterial disease and genitourinary tract diseases, no difference in risk was found between irradiated and non irradiated patients. Radiotherapy significantly reduced rectal carcinoma deaths in both trials and also improved overall survival in the Stockholm II trial. The late intercurrent mortality was similar in irradiated and nonirradiated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although high dose, short term, preoperative radiotherapy can improve outcome after surgery for rectal carcinoma, there also may be an increased risk for long term morbidity. Refinement of the radiotherapy technique and a more accurate selection of patients suitable for the treatment will probably further improve the results, at least in regard to treatment-related complications</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="303"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND/AIMS: This report provides our experience in 103 patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum along with a general overview of the use of circular stapler in rectal surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients were randomized to a rectal anastomosis using either the single (SST) or double stapling technique (DST). RESULTS: From February 1991 to the present, 61 consecutive patients were treated to a rectal anastomosis using the DST. Perioperative mortality was 4.7 percent unrelated to the use of staplers. Statistically significant differences were noted: the mean distal resection margin measured 25.3 mm for SST and 35.0 mm for DST (p = 0.0274), without doughnut rings. Anastomotic stricture occurred in 3 patients (25%) using the 28-mm cartridge and in 1 (1.4%) using the 31-mm cartridge, respectively (p = 0.0082). To evaluate the different stapling techniques with bacterial contamination, the drain fluid was examined for lysozyme activity. When the SST was used, statistically significant enzyme activity increased as compared with the DST. Clinical leaks were noted in 9.5 percent (2/21) of the SST and in 2.4 percent (2/82) of the DST. The median follow-up of patients in the randomized study was 45 months (range, 32-62 months). Of the patients who underwent a potentially curative resection, seven (17.9 percent) developed a local recurrence, with no statistically significant differences in the stapling techniques of local recurrence and overall survival.

It is a component of local defense and is formed in macrophages. Determination of lysozyme content in the wound seems to be the most reliable method for early recognition of wound infection. METHODS: In a prospective randomized study on the efficacy of single vs. double staple technique in anterior rectum resection, the effluent from the pelvic drain was examined with regard to its lysozyme activity. RESULTS: Lysozyme activity in drained secretion remained stable for more than 24 hours at room temperature. When the single staple technique was used, enzyme activity was sharply increased (mean, 9.6 mg/dl on the first postoperative day) compared with the double staple technique (mean, 5.5 mg/dl on the first postoperative day). The difference was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0001). Mean lysozyme activity was increased in those patients with clinically (18 mg/dl on the first postoperative day) and radiologically (15.3 mg/dl on the first postoperative day) detected dehiscence (P &lt; 0.0001).

Independent assessors documented quality of life scores, performance status, toxicities, local response to treatment, and systemic disease progression before treatment and after treatment and every 8 weeks thereafter. Of 75 patients randomized, 73 were eligible for inclusion in the study. Forty-three of these patients had local pelvic tumour recurrence only and 21 also had distant metastases. In addition, nine patients had primary inoperable carcinomas, two of whom also had metastases. Thirty-seven patients were randomized to RT and 36 to VHF + RT. The median dose of radiation in the VHF+RT arm was 4275 cGy with a median fraction size of 150 cGy and median duration of therapy of 48.5 days versus 4500 cGy in the RT-only arm with a median fraction size of 180 cGy and median duration of therapy of 38 days. These doses are unlikely to be significantly different in biological effect. No significant difference between the two groups was observed in extent and duration of local control, measures of toxicity or quality of life scores. Additionally, survival and cumulative incidence of pelvic site of first progression did not differ significantly between the groups.

METHODS: Data from 50 of 52 patients with proven adenocarcinoma (GI/II) and intraluminal ultrasound with Stage uT1 N negative (uTNM) were evaluated in a prospective randomized study with two therapeutic arms: transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM; n = 24) or anterior resection (AR; n = 26), performed under general anesthesia. RESULTS: Patients&apos; ages and rectal tumor locations showed insignificant differences of distribution in comparison of TEM with AR (Welsh&apos;s alternate t-test; t-test). Local recurrence (4.2 percent) and five-year survival rates (96 percent) differed insignificantly (log-rank test). Early postoperative mortality was zero. Significant differences were found comparing time of hospitalization, loss of blood, operation time, and opiate analgesia (Welsh&apos;s alternate t-test; Wilcoxon&apos;s test; each P &lt; 0.05). Early and late morbidity differed considerably. CONCLUSIONS: Lower morbidity, similar local recurrence, and survival rates favor the TEM technique. Comparable results in survival rate to the gold standard (AR) are objective arguments for choosing the adequate surgical procedure.

Among the 172 patients who had the envelope opened, 149 evaluable cases were analyzed for evaluation of the drug. The cumulative 10-year survival rates of Group MMC+HCFU had a statistically significant increase in survival rate compared with Group MMC. In particular, the rate was statistically significant in patients with colorectal cancer who had lymph node invasion. There were no severe side effects due to the adjuvant chemotherapy with MMC+HCFU. Thus the adjuvant chemotherapy with MMC+HCFU is suggested to be a useful and safe postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="378"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND. Colorectal cancer is one of the major malignant diseases and, recently, its incidence appears to be increasing. Surgical resectability is an important prognostic determinant; however, recurrent tumors are commonly noted, even after apparently curative surgery. Because such metastatic disease cannot be cured, better adjuvant therapies are urgently called for. METHODS. We studied the effect of postoperative chemotherapy using 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusions and 1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil (HCFU) oral administration for curatively resected Stage II to IV colorectal cancer. This study was prospectively randomized and controlled and 251 (93.3%) of 269 patients were determined to be candidates for statistical assessment. The inductive regimen for Group A included a total of 6 5-FU intravenous injections, 10 mg/kg, on postoperative days 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, and 9. For maintenance therapy, Group A also received oral HCFU, 300 mg daily for 52 weeks beginning 2 weeks after surgery. The regimen for Group B included only 5-FU injections of Group A. RESULTS. There were no differences in the prognostic factors or doses of 5-FU between Groups A and B. In addition, no difference was observed in the toxicity rate between the two groups. Group A, with 5-FU infusions plus oral HCFU administration, produced a reduction in the recurrence rate and a prolongation of the survival time for patients with rectal cancer. In a retrospective analysis, this protocol was also effective for patients with Stage III to IV, wall invasion-positive, and lymph node metastasis-positive colorectal cancers. CONCLUSIONS. This study suggests that the combination of 5-FU infusions and the continuous oral administration of HCFU is a reasonable therapeutic approach for patients with surgically resected colorectal cancer and a high risk of recurrence</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="433"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Definitive chemoradiation (CR) has replaced radical surgery as the preferred treatment of epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal. To determine the importance of mitomycin (MMC) in the standard CR regimen and to assess the role of salvage CR in patients who have residual tumor following CR, a phase III randomized trial was undertaken by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between August 1988 and December 1991, 310 patients were randomized to receive either radiotherapy (RT) and fluorouracil (5-FU) or radiotherapy, 5-FU, and MMC. Of 291 assessable patients, 145 received 45 to 50.4 Gy of pelvic RT plus 5-FU at 1,000 mg/m2/d for 4 days, and 146 received RT, 5-FU, and MMC (10 mg/m2 per dose for two doses). Patients with residual tumor on posttreatment biopsy were treated with a salvage regimen that consisted of additional pelvic RT (9 Gy), 5-FU, and cisplatin (100 mg/m2). RESULTS: Posttreatment biopsies were positive in 15% of patients in the 5-FU arm versus 7.7% in the MMC arm (P = .135). At 4 years, colostomy rates were lower (9% v 22%; P = .002), colostomy-free survival higher (71% v 59%; P = .014), and disease-free survival higher (73% v 51%; P = .0003) in the MMC arm. A significant difference in overall survival has not been observed at 4 years. Toxicity was greater in the MMC arm (23% v 7% grade 4 and 5 toxicity; P &lt; or = .001). Of 24 assessable patients who underwent salvage CR, 12 (50%) were rendered disease-free. CONCLUSION: Despite greater toxicity, the use of MMC in a definitive CR regimen for anal cancer is justified, particularly in patients with large primary tumors. Salvage CR should be attempted in patients with residual disease following definitive CR before resorting to radical surgery</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="488"><COL><DATA> One thousand two hundred fifty-four cases (610 colonic and 644 rectal cancers resected during 2 years from 1984 and followed up for more than 5 years) were entered from 140 institutions in Japan and analyzed by means of Cox&apos;s proportional hazards model. The analyzed pathologic variables were the size and depth of invasion, Dukes&apos; stage, venous invasion, lymphatic permeation, and other clinical features, such as the sex and age of the patient and location of the tumor. The extent of dissection, serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, and the presence or absence of adjuvant chemotherapy were also analyzed. Adjuvant chemotherapy consisted of three arms for both colonic and rectal cancers. For colonic cancer, arm I was a combination of i.p. (intraportal) and i.v. mitomycin C (MMC) + p.o. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); arm II was i.v. MMC + p.o. 5-FU; and arm III was surgery only. For rectal cancer, arm IV was a combination of i.a. (inferior mesenteric artery) and i.v. MMC + p.o. 5-FU; arm V was i.v. MMC + p.o. 5-FU; and arm VI was surgery only. As for the factors affecting the disease-free survival of the patient, multivariate analysis disclosed nodal involvement, venous invasion, an elevated CEA level, and the lower part of the rectum. The effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on the patient&apos;s survival was proven for rectal cancer but not for colonic cancer. We conclude that these factors should be considered in setting the stage of tumor pre- and postoperatively</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="509"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND/AIMS: This reports presents the results of a prospective randomized controlled study of combined locoregional targeted immuno-chemotherapy for treatment of patients with liver metastasis from primary colorectal malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty eight patients were randomly assigned into one of two groups. Group A (n = 15) included patients who had post-operatively locoregional chemotherapy and Group B (n = 33) included patients who had combined locoregional immuno-chemotherapy. RESULTS: Statistical analysis shows a clear superiority in the survival and responses of patients treated with immuno-chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. Forty five percent of patients in Group B are alive with a mean survival of 20.3 months, ranging from 13 to 29 months, as opposed to no survivors from Group A and a mean survival of only 9.9 months, ranging from 3.6 to 22.5 months. Additionally, 64% of the immuno-chemotherapy group had a positive response while only 13% of the chemotherapy had such a response.

Sequential use of MTX given 24 h prior to 5-FU has resulted in enhanced cell kill in vitro and in vivo. In addition, administration of FA prior to 5-FU has led to potentiation of 5-FU action by stabilization of the ternary complex of thymidine synthase. In the present randomized study, two groups of patients with advanced colorectal cancer were treated as follows: 43 patients (pts) in group A received 5-FU + FA, whereas 45 pts in group B received 5-FU + FA + MTX. The dosage was as follows: group A received FA i.v. at 300 mg/m2 per day, prior to i.v. 5-FU at 500 mg/m2 per day on days 1-4; group B was given MTX i.v. at 130 mg/m2 per day on day 0, followed 24 h later by FA at 15 mg q6h x 6, and 5-FU + FA was started on day 1 and given at the same doses and schedule described for group A. Objective responses were achieved by 8/43 pts in group A (1 complete response and 7 partial responses) and by 18/45 pts in group B (3 complete and 15 partial responses), all occurring in the liver. There was no significant difference in the median time to progression (group A 6.1 months, group B 6.8 months) or the median survival (group A 9.2 months, group B 10.3 months). Toxicity was significantly greater in group B [grade 2-3 mucositis 20% versus only 2% in group A (P &lt; 0.0001); grade 3 diarrhea in group B 15% versus 3% in group A (P &lt; 0.001)]. According to our results, double biological modulation of 5-FU with MTX + FA led to an enhanced response rate with increased toxicity as compared with the 5-FU + FA regimen given at less than its maximally tolerated dose</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="549"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: This trial was performed to evaluate the impact of adjuvant brachytherapy on local and systemic recurrence rates in patients with soft tissue sarcoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a single-institution prospective randomized trial, 164 patients were randomized intraoperatively to receive either adjuvant brachytherapy (BRT) or no further therapy (no BRT) after complete resection of soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity or superficial trunk. The adjuvant radiation was administered by iridium-192 implant, which delivered 42 to 45 Gy over 4 to 6 days. The two study groups had comparable distributions of patient and tumor factors, including age, sex, tumor site, tumor size, and histologic type and grade. RESULTS: With a median follow-up time of 76 months, the 5-year actuarial local control rates were 82% and 69% in the BRT and no BRT groups (P = .04), respectively. Patients with high- grade lesions had local control rates of 89% (BRT) and 66% (no BRT) (P = .0025). BRT had no impact on local control in patients with low-grade lesions (P = .49). The 5-year freedom-from-distant-recurrence rates were 83% and 76% in the BRT and no BRT groups (P = .60), respectively. Analysis by histologic grade did not demonstrate an impact of BRT on the development of distant metastasis, despite the improvement in local control noted in patients with high-grade lesions. The 5-year disease- specific survival rates for the BRT and no BRT groups were 84% and 81% (P = .65), respectively, with no impact of BRT regardless of tumor grade. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant brachytherapy improves local control after complete resection of soft tissue sarcomas. This improvement in local control is limited to patients with high-grade histopathology. The reduction in local recurrence in patients with high-grade lesions is not associated with a significant reduction in distant metastasis or improvement in disease-specific survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="550"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: The effect of the sensitizer razoxane on soft tissue sarcomas (STS) was prospectively evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial. The main purpose of the study was to determine the response rates and local control under the combined treatment compared to irradiation alone. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1978 and 1988, 144 patients entered the study; 130 were evaluable for response, toxicity, or survival. The patients were randomized to receive radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy with razoxane. They were divided into postoperative cases and patients with gross disease (unresectable primaries, recurrent disease, or metastatic disease). The median radiation dose was 60 Gy postoperatively, and 56-58 Gy in patients with gross disease. The dose difference has palliative reasons. Razoxane was given orally at a daily dose of 150 mg/m2 during the time of the radiotherapy, starting 5 days before the first irradiation. In general, the groups were comparable as to their prognostic factors. There was some imbalance, however, in favor of the postoperative group reveiving radiotherapy alone. RESULTS: Between the patient groups treated postoperatively in an adjuvant form, there were no substantial differences in local control and survival. Among 82 patients with gross disease, the treatment with radiotherapy and razoxane led to an increased response rate compared to photon irradiation alone (74 vs. 49%). The local control rate was likewise improved (64 vs. 30%;p &lt; 0.05). The acute toxicity was somewhat higher in the sensitizer arm, but there was no difference in the occurrence of late complications. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy combined with razoxane seems to improve the local control in inoperable, residual, or recurrent STS compared to radiotherapy alone. The combined treatment is a fairly well tolerated procedure at low costs. It can be recommended for inoperable primary STS or gross disease after incomplete resection, conditions which are still associated with limited local control and a grave prognosis</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="688"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND/AIMS: This prospective randomized study was aimed to clarify the efficacy of epirubicin after radical hepatic resection for hepatcellular carcinoma (HCC).

Groups A and B included 40 and 48 eligible cases, respectively. RESULTS: No obvious intergroup differences were observed including prescribed dose of UFT. The 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates (Groups A vs B) were 82 vs 90%, 50 vs 49% and 35 vs 30% (p = 0.2162). Excluding 4 operative deaths, the recurrence-free survival rates were 65 vs 70%, 32 vs 37% and 14 vs 17% (p = 0.3843). Initial recurrence sites were also similar.

We investigated whether nutritional support would have beneficial effects for such patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 19 patients, 10 were given peripheral dextrose (10 kcal/kg/day) for seven days following hepatectomy and the other 9 were given hypertonic glucose. Twenty and 30 kcal/kg/day was the average non-protein caloric intake, including free oral intake during the first one week following hepatectomy, respectively. RESULTS: The groups were comparable with regard to laboratory data and operative stress. There were no untoward effects related to this support. In patients given nutritional support, retinol binding protein and prealbumin improved (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively), urinary 3-methylhistidine excretion decreased (p &lt; 0.01) and the nitrogen balance normalized earlier (p &lt; 0.05), as compared to findings with the conventional method.

From September 1990 through June 1993, 150 consecutive patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma were randomly assigned to receive either perioperative PN (n = 75), in addition to usual oral diet, or to no additional therapy (oral diet alone without PN; n = 75). Excluding patients with metastatic disease, a total of 64 patients in the perioperative PN group (39 with associated cirrhosis, 18 with chronic active hepatitis, and 7 without associated liver disease) were compared to 60 control patients (33 with cirrhosis, 12 with chronic active hepatitis and 15 with no associated liver disease). PN was started 7 days before hepatic resection and continued for 7 days after operation in the experimental patients. The PN consisted of standard micronutrients, dextrose, lipid emulsion (containing 50 percent of lipid as medium-chain triglycerides, MCT) and amino acids enriched in branched-chain amino acids (BCAA, 35 percent of PN protein intake), and provided = 1.5 g protein/kg/day and 30 kcal/kg/day. PN was administered via a superior vena cava Broviac catheter cycled over 12 hours each evening preoperatively, and as a 24 hour infusion during the postoperative week. Control patients received only 5 percent dextrose in normal saline postoperatively, with volume and sodium content similar to the experimental PN-treated patients. All patients studied (experimental and control) received 25 grams of albumin intravenously for 5 days postoperatively, and all were allowed to consume enteral diet as tolerated throughout the entire study period. Preoperative assessment included standard anthropometric indices, serum chemistries and proteins, indocyanine green clearance (an index of hepatic function), hand grip strength, and immune function tests (serum immunoglobulin concentrations and peripheral lymphocyte stimulation by phytohemagglutinin). Postoperative assessment included the same preoperative indices (chemistries measured from days 1 to 8 post-operatively), and overall postoperative mortality and morbidity during the hospitalization. Morbidity indices included both infectious complications and non-infectious complications (eg, pleural effusion, ascites, renal failure, hepatic coma). The two groups of patients were similar in age, sex, total and percent weight loss, hepatic carcinoma stage, incidence of cirrhosis, and other preoperative indices. However, a higher percentage of patients in the PN group had abnormal preoperative hepatic function by indocyanine green clearance (67 vs 47%, p = 0.03). The proportion undergoing major hepatectomy and other important intraoperative factors were similar between groups. No significant difference in postoperative hospital mortality occurred between groups (PN 8% vs control 15%; p = 0.30), and PN use did not change hand-grip strength, skin-fold thickness or midarm circumference. However, a significant beneficial effect of PN on hospital morbidity was observed Perioperative PN use was associated with a significant reduction in the overall postoperative morbidity rate (PN group 34% vs control group 55%; p = 0.02). This difference was mainly due to a significant reduction in infectious complications (PN 17% vs control 37%; p = 0.01), and in the need for diuretic drugs to control ascites (PN 25% vs control 50%; p = 0.004). There were no differences between groups in serum immunoglobulins or lymphocyte response to mitogens. There was less deterioration of liver function with PN as measured by the change in the rate of indocyanine green clearance (PN group -2.8% loss vs control group -4.8% loss; p = 0.05). </DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="692"><COL><DATA> Adjuvant oral chemotherapy was studied in 67 patients with stage II hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent curative resection between May 1988 and December 1990. Patients were stratified into two groups according to preoperative liver dysfunction: 55 had stage I disease (mild dysfunction) and 12 had stage II (moderate dysfunction). A randomized controlled study of postoperative oral administration of 1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil (HCFU) was conducted in each group. From October 1994 HCFU administration was suspended because of side-effects in nine patients with stage I liver dysfunction and in three with stage II dysfunction who had received the drug for more than 4 weeks. Cumulative survival and recurrence-free survival rates of patients with stage I disease in the treatment group were higher (P = 0.08 and P = 0.04 respectively) than those in the control group. However, in patients with stage II disease no significant difference was observed (P = 0.77 and P = 1.0 respectively).

We developed an acyclic retinoid, polyprenoic acid, that inhibits hepatocarcinogenesis in the laboratory and induces differentiation and apoptosis in cell lines derived from human hepatoma. In a randomized, controlled study, we tested whether the compound reduced the incidence of recurrent and second primary hepatomas after curative treatment. METHODS: We prospectively studied 89 patients who were free of disease after surgical resection of a primary hepatoma or the percutaneous injection of ethanol. We randomly assigned the patients to receive either polyprenoic acid (600 mg daily) or placebo for 12 months. We studied the remnant liver by ultrasonography every three months after randomization. The primary end point of the study was the appearance of a histologically confirmed recurrent or new hepatoma. RESULTS: Treatment with polyprenoic acid significantly reduced the incidence of recurrent or new hepatomas. After a median follow-up of 38 months, 12 patients in the polyprenoic acid group (27 percent) had recurrent or new hepatomas as compared with 22 patients in the placebo group (49 percent, P = 0.04). The most striking difference was in the groups that had second primary hepatomas--7 in the group receiving polyprenoic acid as compared with 20 in the placebo group (P = 0.04 by the log-rank test). Cox proportional-hazards analysis demonstrated that as an independent factor, polyprenoic acid reduced the occurrence of second primary hepatomas (adjusted relative risk, 0.31; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.12 to 0.78).

Of a total of 115 registered patients having solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 2 to 5 cm in diameter, 18 (15.7%) were excluded after randomization. As a result, 97 patients were chosen as subjects and divided into two groups: hepatectomy with (group A: n=50) and without (group B: n=47) pre-operative TAE. The period of observation of the patients who survived the surgery was between 4.0 and 6.6 years. The randomization appeared to have provided well-balanced groups of patients and the clinico-pathological characteristics of the two groups were quite similar. The necrotic part of the cancerous lesions, as confirmed by operative specimens, amounted to 74.8+/-33.4% (mean +/-SD) in group A and 6.8+/-7.2% in group B (P&lt;0.01). However, the cancer-free survival rates after hepatectomy in both groups showed little difference (39.1+/-7.0 (%+/-SE) and 31.1+/-0.1, respectively). We speculate that TAE is not effective against such HCC accessory lesions as minute intrahepatic metastasis and tumor thrombus and that pre-operative TAE does not improve post-operative survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="695"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: A prospective, randomized trial was performed to determine if intra-abdominal drainage catheters are necessary after elective liver resection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 1992 and April 1994, 120 patients subjected to liver resection, stratified by extent of resection and by surgeon, were randomized to receive or not receive operative closed-suction drainage. Operative blood loss was not an exclusion criteria, and no patient who consented to the study was excluded. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients (73%) had resection of one hepatic lobe or more (27 lobectomies, 54 trisegmentectomies, and 6 bilobar atypical resections) and 33 had less than a lobectomy (8 wedge resections or enucleations, 9 segmentectomies, and 16 bisegmentectomies). Eighty-four patients (70%) had metastatic cancer and 36 patients (30%) had primary liver pathology. There were no differences in outcome, including length of hospital stay (no drain, 13.4 +/- 0.9 days; drain, 13.1 +/- 0.8 days; P = not significant [NS]), mortality (no drain, 3.3%; drain, 3.3%), complication rate (no drain, 43%; drain, 48%; P = NS), or requirement for subsequent percutaneous drainage (no drain, 18%; drain, 8%; P = NS). All infected collections (n = 3) occurred in operatively drained patients. Two other complications were directly related to the operatively placed drains. One patient developed a subcutaneous abscess at the drain site, and a second developed a subcutaneous drain tract tumor recurrence as the only current site of recurrence. CONCLUSION: In the first 50 consecutive resections performed since the conclusion of this trial, only 4 patients (8%) have required subsequent percutaneous drainage.

To establish the value of this BEC regimen as neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we initiated in 1989 a large international Phase III trial. It compares three cycles of BEC followed by radiotherapy to radiotherapy alone. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From November 1989 to October 1993, 339 patients with negative metastases workup, stratified by accrual center have been randomized, 168 to radiotherapy alone and 171 to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy. All patients characteristics were well balanced in both arms. There was a quality control/data verification by specialist panel (radiology, histology, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) and external policy board expert every 60-80 patients having completed treatment. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 49 months (range: 23-70), despite an excess of treatment-related deaths in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy arm (8 vs. 1%), there is a significant difference in disease free survival favoring the chemotherapy arm (p &lt; 0.01). The proportion of local and/or regional metastases was comparable in both arms. No difference in overall survival is seen but the numbers of events needed for analysis has not yet been reached.

However, preclinical data suggests that the optimal therapeutic and immunomodulatory dose may not be the maximally tolerated clinical dose. We conducted a Phase II/III trial in good prognosis patients with metastatic melanoma to determine whether a therapeutic and immunomodulatory dose-response curve of IFN-gamma could be identified, and whether the two could be correlated. Ninety-eight patients with metastatic melanoma were randomized to one of seven dose levels of IFN-gamma ranging from 0.01 to 0.90 mg/m2. All patients were required to have s.c., skin, soft tissue, or nodal disease, although visceral disease was also allowed, and no more than one prior chemotherapy regimen. Patients received IFN-gamma as a 1-h i.v. infusion three times per week for at least 8 weeks or until progressive disease. Ninety-five patients were eligible for toxicity evaluation; 81 were eligible for tumor response. Four patients responded to therapy (response rate, 5%) at three dose levels: two patients at 0.01 mg/m2 and one each at 0.5 and 0.9 mg/m2. The duration of response ranged from 5 to 58 weeks. Toxicities were typical of IFNs and included flu-like constitutional symptoms. No dose-response relationship was identified for efficacy. A dose-response relationship for toxicity was observed only for fever and chills (p = 0.035) and hepatic toxicity (p = 0.034). IFN-gamma has minimal activity in metastatic melanoma, and a therapeutic dose-response curve could not be identified. Although potent dose-dependent effects on immunomodulation were identified (J. M.

On the contrary, at present there are no data related to the possible efficacy of melatonin as an adjuvant endocrine therapy. This study was performed to investigate the impact of melatonin therapy on the disease-free survival (DFS) in melanoma patients surgically treated for regional node recurrence. The study included 30 node-relapsed melanoma patients, who were randomized to receive no treatment or adjuvant therapy of melatonin (20 mg/day orally in the evening) every day until disease progression. After a median follow up of 31 months, the percent of DFS was significantly higher in melatonin-treated individuals than in controls.

We also examined the effect of adding the immune modulator levamisole to the two different schedules of IL-2. Thirty-nine patients were entered into two sequential phase I/II studies. Eighteen patients entered study 1 and were randomised to receive IL-2, 3 x 10(6) IU m-2 day-1, subcutaneously for 3 months with or without levamisole 50 mg t.d.s. p.o. on days 1-3 on alternate weeks. Twenty-one patients entered study 2 and were randomised to receive 5.4 x 10(6) IU m-2 day-1 subcutaneously for 3 months with or without levamisole 50 mg t.d.s. p.o. on days 1-3 on alternate weeks. Blood was taken for peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) phenotype analysis, and measurement of IL-2, soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and neopterin concentration. Two patients with metastatic melanoma, one in each study, responded (11.8%); both received IL-2 alone. Observations of immunological parameters showed that treatment with subcutaneous IL-2 resulted in a significant rise in the percentage of PBLs bearing CD25, CD3/HLA-DR, CD56 and levels of IL-2 receptor and neopterin. The total white blood cell count (WBC) and total lymphocyte count rose significantly on day 18 compared with pretreatment levels. The addition of levamisole to either IL-2 schedule resulted in no significant changes in any immunological parameters. This study illustrates that prolonged subcutaneous IL-2 can be given safely in the outpatient setting. There was no evidence that levamisole acts as an immunomodulator in this study</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="816"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: We designed and conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare the response rates and survival of patients with metastatic melanoma who received carmustine (BCNU), dacarbazine (DTIC), and cisplatin with tamoxifen, or the same chemotherapy with placebo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with metastatic melanoma received either BCNU 150 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) on day 1, DTIC 220 mg/m2 i.v. daily on days 1 to 3 and on days 22 to 24, and cisplatin 25 mg/m2 i.v. daily on days 1 to 3 and on days 22 to 24 with placebo every 6 weeks, or the same chemotherapy with tamoxifen 160 mg orally daily for 7 days before chemotherapy and 40 mg orally daily throughout the remainder of the treatment cycle. Patients were treated on protocol for up to three cycles depending on the type of response. Assuming that a minimum increase in response rate of 20% would be necessary to conclude that tamoxifen conferred a clinically important benefit, we designed the study with an 80% chance of detecting that difference at the 5% level (two-sided). RESULTS: Between February 1992 and January 1995, 211 patients were accrued, 199 of whom were considered assessable for response and toxicity. The overall response rate was 21% in the placebo group and 30% in the tamoxifen group (P = .187). Complete and partial responses were 3% and 27%, respectively, for the tamoxifen group and 6% and 14%, respectively, for the placebo group. Poor performance status and liver involvement were associated with a reduced likelihood to respond to treatment. Major toxicities were similar in both groups with no statistically significant difference in the rates of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary thromboembolus, grade 4 neutropenia, or grade 4 thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that the addition of high doses of tamoxifen to this chemotherapy regimen does not increase the response rate compared with chemotherapy alone in unselected patients with metastatic melanoma</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="817"><COL><DATA> The ESHO protocol 3-85 is a multicentre randomized trial investigating the value of hyperthermia as an adjuvant to radiotherapy in treatment of malignant melanoma. A total of 134 metastatic of recurrent malignant melanoma lesions in 70 patients were randomized to receive radiotherapy alone (3 fractions in 8 days) or each fraction followed by hyperthermia (aimed for 43 degrees C for 60 min). Radiation was given with high voltage photons or electrons. Tumours were stratified according to institution and size (above or below 4 cm) and randomly assigned to a total radiation dose of either 24 or 27 Gy to be given with or without hyperthermia. The endpoint was persistent complete response in the treated area. A number of 128 tumours in 68 patients were evaluable, with an observation time between 3 and 72 months. Sixty-five tumours were randomized to radiation alone and 63 to radiation + heat. Sixty received 24 Gy and 68 tumours received 27 Gy, respectively. Size was &lt; or = 4 cm in 81 and &gt; 4 cm in 47 tumours. Overall the 2-year actuarial local tumour control was 37%. Univariate analysis showed prognostic influence of hyperthermia (rad alone 28% versus rad + heat 46%, p = 0.008) and radiation dose (24 Gy 25% versus 27 Gy 56%, p = 0.02), but not of tumour size (small 42% versus large 29%, p = 0.21). A Cox multivariate regression analysis showed the most important prognostic parameters to be: hyperthermia (odds ratio: 1.73 (1.07-2.78), p = 0.02), tumour size (odds ratio: 0.91 (0.85-0.99), p = 0.05) and radiation dose (odds ratio: 1.17 (1.01-1.36), p = 0.05). Analysis of the heating quality showed a significant relationship between the extent of heating and local tumour response. Addition of heat did not significantly increase the acute or late radiation reactions. The overall 5-year survival rate of the patients was 19%, but 38% in patients if all known disease was controlled, compared to 8% in the patients with persistent active disease</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="818"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: A phase III, randomized, double-blind, multi-institutional trial was performed evaluating active specific immunotherapy using vaccinia melanoma oncolysate (VMO) in the surgical adjuvant setting in patients with stage II melanoma (UICC staging). The first interim analysis showed no significant difference in disease-free and overall survival. The data were further analyzed to identify subsets of patients with improved outcome when treated with VMO. METHODS: Patients received either VMO or placebo of live vaccinia vaccine virus (V), once a week for 13 weeks and then once every 2 weeks for an additional 39 weeks or until recurrence. Having stratified patients according to sex, age, number of positive nodes, tumor thickness, and clinical stage, data were analyzed for disease-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS: Male patients showed a 17% difference in overall survival at 4 years when treated with VMO (p = 0.19). A subset of male patients &lt; 57 years of age with one to five positive nodes showed a 30% difference at 4 years with VMO (p = 0.06). Patients with clinical stage I but pathological stage II disease (both male and female), who had undergone prophylactic node dissection, showed a 23% difference in survival at 3 years with VMO (p = 0.11). CONCLUSIONS: This subset analysis shows encouraging survival benefit in certain subsets of patients and an increasing trend in overall survival.

METHODS: A randomized controlled study of IFN alpha-2b (Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ) administered at maximum-tolerated doses of 20 MU/m2/d intravenously (i.v.) for 1 month and 10 MU/m2 three times per week subcutaneously (SC) for 48 weeks versus observation, was conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) in 287 patients. RESULTS: A significant prolongation of relapse-free survival (P = .0023, one-sided) and prolongation of overall survival (P = .0237, one-sided) was observed with IFN alpha-2b therapy in this trial, which is now mature with a median follow-up time of 6.9 years. The impact of treatment on relapse rate is most pronounced early during the treatment interval. The overall benefit of treatment in this trial was analyzed stratified by tumor burden and the presence or absence of microscopic nonpalpable and palpable regional lymph node metastasis. The benefit of therapy with IFN alpha-2b was greatest among node-positive strata. Toxicity of IFN alpha-2b required dose modification in the majority of patients, but treatment at &gt; or = 80% of the scheduled dose was feasible in the majority of patients through the IV phase of treatment, and for more than 3 months of SC maintenance therapy. Discontinuation of treatment due to toxicity was infrequent after the fourth month of therapy. CONCLUSION: IFN alpha-2b prolongs the relapse-free interval and overall survival of high-risk resected melanoma patients. The increment in median disease-free survival (from 1 to 1.7 years) and overall survival (from 2.8 to 3.8 years) that results from this therapy is associated with a 42% improvement in the fraction of patients who are continuously disease-free after treatment with IFN (from 26% to 37%) in comparison to observation. IFN alpha-2b is the first agent to show a significant benefit in relapse-free and overall survival of high-risk melanoma patients in a randomized controlled trial</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="925"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: In the past, radical margins of excision were prescribed for cutaneous melanoma based on preconceived notions rather than on hard clinical evidence. METHODS: In a prospective study of 742 patients with intermediate-thickness melanoma (1-4 mm), 470 patients with trunk or proximal extremity lesions were randomized into a 2- or 4-cm margin. Patients with distal extremity or head and neck lesions (n = 272) received uniformly a 2-cm margin. RESULTS: The overall rate of local recurrence was 3.8%. This rate in the randomized portion (n = 470) was 2.1% for the 2-cm margin and 2.6% for the 4-cm margin (p = 0.72). A progressive increase in local recurrence rates was observed with thickness: 2.3% for lesions 1.0-2.0 mm, 4.2% for those 2.01-3.0 mm, and 11.7% for those 3.01-4.0 mm thick (p = 0.001). Local recurrence occurred in 1.5% of those without ulceration and in 10.6% of those with ulceration of the primary lesion (p = 0.001). The local recurrence rate was not significantly affected by the margin of resection even among the thicker or ulcerated lesions. It also was not affected significantly by the method of closure of the primary site or management of the regional nodes, or the age or gender of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: A 2-cm margin is as effective as a 4-cm margin in local control and survival of intermediate-thickness melanomas. The local recurrence rate is significantly affected by the thickness of the primary lesion and the presence or not of ulceration</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="926"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: A prospective multi-institutional randomized surgical trial involving 740 stage I and II melanoma patients was conducted by the Intergroup Melanoma Surgical Program to determine whether elective (immediate) lymph node dissection (ELND) for intermediate-thickness melanoma (1-4 mm) improves survival rates compared with clinical observation of the lymph nodes. A second objective was to define subgroups of melanoma patients who would have a higher survival with ELND. METHODS: The eligible patients were stratified according to tumor thickness, anatomic site, and ulceration, and then were prerandomized to either ELND or nodal observation. Femoral, axillary, or modified neck dissections were performed using standardized surgical guidelines. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 7.4 years. A multifactorial (Cox regression) analysis showed that the following factors independently influenced survival: tumor ulceration, trunk site, tumor thickness, and patient age. Surgical treatment results were first compared based on randomized intent. Overall 5-year survival was not significantly different for patients who received ELND or nodal observation. However, the 552 patients 60 years of age or younger (75% of total group) with ELND has a significantly better 5-year survival. Among these patients, 5-year survival was better with ELND versus nodal observation for the 335 patients with tumors 1 to 2 mm thick, the 403 patients without tumor ulceration, and the 284 patients with tumors 1 to 2 mm thick and no ulceration. In contrast, patients older than 60 years of age who had ELND actually had a lower survival trend than those who had nodal observation. When survival rates were compared based on treatment actually received (i.e., including crossover patients), the patients with significantly improved 5-year survival rates after ELND included those with tumors 1 to 2 mm thick, those without tumor ulceration, and those 60 years of age or younger with tumors 1 to 2 mm thick or without ulceration. CONCLUSION: This is the first randomized study to prove the value of surgical treatment for clinically occult regional metastases. Patients 60 years or age or younger with intermediate-thickness melanomas, especially with nonulcerative melanoma and those with tumors 1 to 2 mm thick, may benefit from ELND. However, because some patients still are developing distant disease, these results should be considered an interim analysis</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="927"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: The traditional surgical treatment for primary malignant melanoma has often been a wide excision with a margin of about 5 cm. Since the risk of local recurrences is dependent on tumor thickness, thin tumors (&lt;1 mm) have routinely been excised with a narrow margin. For thick tumors, the optimal resection margin is controversial, and can be determined only by prospective, randomized trials. METHODS: The Swedish Melanoma Study Group performed a prospective, randomized multicenter study to evaluate an excision margin of 2 versus 5 cm for patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma with tumor thickness &gt; 0.8 and &lt; or = 2.0 mm. The trial includes 769 patients. Patients with melanomas of the skin of the head, neck, hands, feet, or vulva were not included in the trial. In the event of an excision biopsy for diagnosis, radical surgery was completed within 6 weeks. The median follow-up time was 5.8 years for estimation of survival and 4.0 years for diagnosis of recurrent disease. RESULTS: No significant differences have been observed between the treatment groups regarding local or regional recurrences or survival. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend an excision with a margin of 2 cm for cutaneous malignant melanoma with a tumor thickness &gt; 0.8 and &lt; or = 2.0 mm</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="944"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Radioiodine has been used for more than a half-century to ablate thyroid remnants following thyroid surgery, but a single optimal dose has not been established. We designed a prospective randomized trial to determine the optimal dose of 131 I for remnant ablation. METHODS: Using a simple randomization technique, 149 patients with remnant thyroid were incorporated into 4 treatment groups. Twenty-seven of these patients were administered 25 to 34 millicurie (mCi) of 131 I (30 +/- 1.5), 54 received 35 to 64 mCi (50.6 +/- 5.4), 38 received 65 to 119 mCi (88.6 +/- 14) and 30 patients received 120 to 200 mCi (155 +/- 28.7). Six months to 1 year after treatment, all subjects were reassessed after withdrawing L-thyroxine for 4 to 6 weeks. A successful ablation was defined as the absence of thyroid bed activity in 5 mCi 131 I neck scan at 48 hours along with 2 adjunctive criteria which were the neck uptake of &lt;0.2% of the administered activity and the thyroglobulin (Tg) value of &lt;10 ng/mL. RESULTS: Applying the above criteria, we observed complete ablation of 17 of 27 thyroid gland remnants (63%) in the 30 mCi group, 42 of 54 (77.8%) in the 50 mCi group, 28 of 38 (73.7%) in the 90 mCi group and 23 of 30 (76.7%) in the 155 mCi group. When the radiation-absorbed dose was calculated, a 30 mCi dose delivered approximately 20,000 centigray (cGy), a 50 mCi dose about 30,000 cGy, a 90 mCi dose about 50,000 cGy, and a 155 mCi dose about 130,000 cGy. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the empirical 131 I initial dose to more than 50 mCi results in plateauing of the dose-response curve and thus, conventional high dose remnant ablation needs critical evaluation. Based on dosimetry results, one should aim to deliver about 30,000 cGy to the thyroid remnant, as higher doses do not appear to yield a higher ablation rate</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="954"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if the perioperative administration of a supplemented enteral formula modulates selective inflammatory and immune variables and gut function after surgery. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, clinical trial. SETTING: Department of surgery, university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty patients with neoplasm of the colorectum or stomach. INTERVENTION: Seven days before surgery, the patients drank 1 L/d of a control enteral formula (n = 20) or the same formula enriched with arginine, RNA, and omega-3 fatty acids (n = 20).Jejunal infusion with the same formulas was started 6 hours after operation and continued until day 7. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Immune response was determined by phagocytosis ability and respiratory burst of polymorphonuclear cells, and inflammatory response by plasma levels of C-reactive protein. Operative intestinal microperfusion, postoperative intestinal mucosa oxygen metabolism, and plasma intestinal isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase were used as indicators of gut function. Plasma nitric oxide also was determined. RESULTS: In the enriched group, phagocytosis ability and respiratory burst after surgery was higher (P &lt; .01) and C-reactive protein level was lower (P &lt; .05) than in the control group. The enriched group had higher mean (+/-SD) intestinal microperfusion (180 +/- 46 vs 146 +/- 59 perfusion units, P &lt; .05), intestinal mucosa oxygen metabolism (pHi 7.39 +/- 0.2 vs pHi 7.33 +/- 0.1, P &lt; .05), and 5-fold lower levels of intestinal isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (P &lt; .05). Postoperative levels of nitric oxide were higher in the enriched group (P &lt; .05, analysis of variance).

DESIGN: Prospectively randomised study. SETTING: Teaching hospital, Taiwan, R.O.C. PATIENTS: 93 patients with periampullary cancer undergoing Whipple&apos;s operation were randomly divided into two groups. Forty-six with periampullary cancer underwent invaginating pancreaticojejunostomy, and 47 patients underwent duct to mucosa anastomosis for reconstruction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality and morbidity were compared between two groups. RESULTS: The over all mortality was 8% (7/93). An albumin concentration of less than 30 g/L before operation and operative blood loss influenced the surgical mortality both in the univariate and multivariate analysis. Age over 70 years was not a factor. Patients with duct to mucosa anastomoses had a leak rate of 4% (2/47), morbidity of 21% (10/47) and mortality of 6% (3/47). Patients with an invaginated pancreaticojejunostomy had a leak rate of 15% (7/46), morbidity of 33% (15/46), and mortality of 9% (4/46). The need for total parenteral nutrition in the invaginated group (33%) was statistically greater than in the other group (11%) (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The morbidity and mortality of pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary cancer although slightly greater for patients over the age of 70 are acceptable. The factors that may influence the mortality are an albumin concentration of less then 30 g/L and the amount of blood lost during operation. The duct to mucosa anastomosis is a safe procedure, which has a lower leak rate and less need for total parenteral nutrition than pancreaticojejunostomy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1120"><COL><DATA> To clarify the effect of neoadjuvant intraarterial infusion chemotherapy on the cure rate in advanced cervical cancer with bulky tumor, a total of 50 patients were examined prospectively. The clinical stage according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification included 23 IIb, 6 IIIa, and 21 IIIb. These patients were randomly divided into the neoadjuvant intraarterial infusion chemotherapy group and the control group. There were no significant differences in mean age, FIGO clinical stage, and tumor histology between groups. Twenty-five patients in the former group were given 25 mg/m2 of cisplatin and 15 mg/m2 of bleomycin via each internal iliac artery. If the results of the evaluation indicated that surgery was feasible, radical surgery was performed. The patients whose tumors were inoperable received radiation therapy consisting of external irradiation and intracavitary irradiation. Twenty-five patients in the control group also underwent the same radiation therapy. The overall response rate was 80.0%. Eighteen of 20 responders underwent surgery. The 3-year survival rate was 85.7% for operated patients, 42.9% for patients receiving neoadjuvant intraarterial infusion chemotherapy followed by irradiation, and 49.5% for the control group.

The locoregional failure rate remains high in advanced cervical carcinoma. Chemotherapy (CT) was added to radiotherapy (RT) in order to increase disease control and to improve 5-year survival. METHODS. CT + RT included cisplatin administered 100mg/m2, d.1 plus 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2 D.1 to 5, ci (120 hrs), q every 3rd week for 3 cycles, followed by RT. RT included external beam irradiation 64.8 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions, five days a week, by 4-field box technique. The median follow-up was 46 months. Ninety-four patients were evaluable for survival, 47 in the CT + RT group and 47 in the RT group. Ninety-two patients were evaluable for response. Known prognostic factors were equally distributed between the two groups. RESULTS. Of the 43 patients evaluable before RT, 31 (72%) achieved a partial or complete response after CT alone. After RT, 52 patients attained a complete response, 25 in the CT + RT group and 27 in the RT-group. Sixty-three patients developed distant metastases or local relapse, 30 in the CT + RT group and 33 in the RT group. In the CT + RT group 6 of the 9 patients with metastases also had local progression at relapse, in the RT group, 7 of 17 patients. The survival rates for the two groups are not statistically different. Thirty-seven patients are alive, 29 have no evidence of disease. Fifty-seven have died, 29 in the CT + RT group and 28 in the RT group. Fifty-four deaths were related to cancer, and 3 to therapy. CONCLUSIONS.

METHODS: Prospective multicenter randomized Phase III trial. Patients with Stage IB-IIA cervical cancer undergoing RH-PLND were eligible. Risk factors include deep cervical invasion, tumor &gt; or = 4 cm, parametrial involvement, nonsquamous histology, and/or pelvic lymph node metastasis. Chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin and bleomycin, alone or in combination with whole pelvic RT. Survival was determined by Kaplan-Meier estimate. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were entered from 1987 to 1994. Seventy-five patients had a Stage IB cancer and 14 patients had Stage IIA. Twenty-five patients had &gt; or = 3 risk factors. Forty-four patients received chemotherapy alone vs 45 patients treated with chemotherapy and RT. Nineteen patients had recurrences and 16 patients have died. Nine of 44 (20%) patients receiving chemo alone recurred compared to 10/45 (22%) patients receiving chemo and RT (P=ns). Patterns of recurrence were statistically similar between the two treatment arms, even among the subgroup of patients with &gt; or = 3 risk factors. Both regimens were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: CT + RT did not prove a superior adjuvant therapy for patients at high risk of recurrence after RH-PLND for early cervical cancer in this limited trial.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Reduced blood loss during liver resection is achieved by PTC or HVE. Specific complications and postoperative hepatocellular injury mediated with two procedures have not been compared. METHODS: Fifty-two noncirrhotic patients undergoing major liver resections were included in a prospective randomized study comparing both the intraoperative and postoperative courses under PTC (n = 24) or under HVE (n = 28). RESULTS: The two groups were similar at entry, but eight patients were crossed over to the other group during resection. In the HVE group, hemodynamic intolerance occurred in four (14%) patients. In the PTC group, pedicular clamping was not efficient in four patients, including three with involvement of the cavohepatic intersection and one with persistent bleeding due to tricuspid insufficiency. Intraoperative blood losses and postoperative enzyme level reflecting hepatocellular injury were similar in the two groups. Mean operative duration and mean clampage duration were significantly increased after HVE. Postoperative abdominal collections and pulmonary complications were 2.5-fold higher after HVE but without statistical significance, whereas the mean length of postoperative hospital stay was longer after HVE. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that both methods of vascular occlusion are equally effective in reducing blood loss in major liver resections. The HVE is associated with unpredictable hemodynamic intolerance, increased postoperative complications with a longer hospital stay, and should be restricted to lesions involving the cavo-hepatic intersection</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1156"><COL><DATA> </DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1157"><COL><DATA> PURPOSES: A randomized trial was conducted to compare tumorectomy and breast irradiation with modified radical mastectomy. We have analyzed the patterns of failure in each arm of the trial and the prognostic factors that have an independent effect on treatment failures and overall survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The trial included 179 patients with breast cancer of up to 20 mm in diameter at macroscopic examination. Eighty-eight patients had conservative management and 91 a mastectomy. All patients had axillary dissection with frozen-section examination. For patients with positive axillary nodes (N+), a second randomization was performed: lymph node irradiation versus no further regional treatment. Patterns of failure were determined by a competing- risk approach and multivariate analysis. A prognostic-score was determined by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Overall survival, distant metastasis, contralateral breast cancer, new primary malignancy, and locoregional recurrence rates were not significantly different between the two surgical groups, or between lymph node irradiation groups. Most recurrences appeared during the first 10 years. Three distinct prognostic groups were determined taking into account age, tumor size, histologic grading, and number of positive axillary nodes.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 760 patients were randomized to B-13; 1,095 patients with the same eligibility requirements were randomized to B-19. Disease-free survival (DFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and survival were determined using life-table estimates. RESULTS: A significant benefit in overall DFS (74% v 59%; P &lt; .001) was demonstrated at 8 years in all B-13 patients who received M--&gt;F (69% v 56% [P = .006] in those &lt;or= 49 years of age, and 81% v 63% [P = .002] in those &gt;or= 50 years). A survival advantage was evident in older patients (89% v 80%; P = .03). In B-19, through 5 years, an overall DFS advantage (82% v 73%; P &lt; .001) and a borderline survival advantage (88% v 85%; P = .06) were evident with CMF. The DFS (84% v 72%; P &lt; .001) and survival (89% v 84%; P = .04) benefits from CMF were greater in women aged &lt;or= 49 years. M--&gt;F or CMF after lumpectomy and breast irradiation resulted in a low probability of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). In B- 13, the frequency of IBTR was 2.6% following M--&gt;F versus 13.4% in women treated by lumpectomy; it was 0.6% following CMF in B-19. Toxicity &gt;or= grade 3 was more frequent among CMF patients in B-19. The age-related difference in CMF benefit was not related to amount of drug received. CONCLUSION: M--&gt;F and CMF are effective for node-negative patients with ER-negative tumors. The incidence of local-regional or distant metastases and IBTR decreased after either therapy. The benefit from either therapy was evident in all patients, but the CMF advantage was greater in those &lt;or= 49 years.

The findings indicated that tamoxifen therapy provided substantial benefit to patients with early stage disease. However, questions arose about how long the observed benefit would persist, about the duration of therapy necessary to maintain maximum benefit, and about the nature and severity of adverse effects from prolonged treatment. PURPOSE: We evaluated the outcome of patients in the B-14 trial through 10 years of follow-up. In addition, the effects of 5 years versus more than 5 years of tamoxifen therapy were compared. METHODS: In the trial, patients were initially assigned to receive either tamoxifen at 20 mg/day (n = 1404) or placebo (n = 1414). Tamoxifen-treated patients who remained disease free after 5 years of therapy were then reassigned to receive either another 5 years of tamoxifen (n = 322) or 5 years of placebo (n = 321). After the study began, another group of patients who met the same protocol eligibility requirements as the randomly assigned patients were registered to receive tamoxifen (n = 1211). Registered patients who were disease free after 5 years of treatment were also randomly assigned to another 5 years of tamoxifen (n = 261) or to 5 years of placebo (n = 249). To compare 5 years with more than 5 years of tamoxifen therapy, data relating to all patients reassigned to an additional 5 years of the drug were combined. Patients who were not reassigned to either tamoxifen or placebo continued to be followed in the study. Survival, disease-free survival, and distant disease-free survival (relating to failure at distant sites) were estimated by use of the Kaplan-Meier method; differences between the treatment groups were assessed by use of the logrank test. The relative risks of failure (with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were determined by use of the Cox proportional hazards model. Reported P values are two-sided. RESULTS: Through 10 years of follow-up, a significant advantage in disease-free survival (69% versus 57%, P &lt; .0001; relative risk = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.58-0.74), distant disease-free survival (76% versus 67%, P &lt; .0001; relative risk = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.61-0.81), and survival (80% versus 76%, P = .02; relative risk = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.71-0.99) was found for patients in the group first assigned to receive tamoxifen. The survival benefit extended to those 49 years of age or younger and to those 50 years of age or older. Tamoxifen therapy was associated with a 37% reduction in the incidence of contralateral (opposite) breast cancer (P = .007). Through 4 years after the reassignment of tamoxifen-treated patients to either continued-therapy or placebo groups, advantages in disease-free survival (92% versus 86%, P = .003) and distant disease-free survival (96% versus 90%, P = .01) were found for those who discontinued tamoxifen treatment. Survival was 96% for those who discontinued tamoxifen compared with 94% for those who continued tamoxifen treatment (P = .08). A higher incidence of thromboembolic events was seen in tamoxifen-treated patients (through 5 years, 1.7% versus 0.4%). Except for endometrial cancer, the incidence of second cancers was not increased with tamoxifen therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The benefit from 5 years of tamoxifen therapy persists through 10 years of follow-up. No additional advantage is obtained from continuing tamoxifen therapy for more than 5 years</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="79" RECORDID="1"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To investigate the potential gain of the concomitant use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy in improving local control and reducing the need for colostomy, a randomized phase III trial was performed in patients with locally advanced anal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1987 to 1994, 110 patients were randomized between radiotherapy alone and a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The patients had T3-4NO-3 or T1-2N1-3 anal cancer. Radiotherapy consisted of 45 Gy given in 5 weeks, with a daily dose of 1.8 Gy. After a rest period of 6 weeks, a boost of 20 or 15 Gy was given in case of partial or complete response, respectively. Surgical resection as part of the primary treatment was performed if possible in patients who had not responded 6 weeks after 45 Gy or with residual palpable disease after the completion of treatment. Chemotherapy was given during radiotherapy: 750 mg/m2 daily fluorouracil as a continuous infusion on days 1 to 5 and 29 to 33, and a single dose of mitomycin 15 mg/m2 administered on day 1. RESULTS: The addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy resulted in a significant increase in the complete remission rate from 54% for radiotherapy alone to 80% for radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and from 85% to 96%, respectively, if results are considered after surgical resections. This led to a significant improvement of locoregional control and colostomy-free interval (P = .02 and P = .002, respectively), both in favor of the combined modality treatment. The locoregional control rate improved by 18% at 5 years, while the colostomy-free rate at that time increased by 32% by the addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy. No significant difference was found when severe side effects were considered, although anal ulcers were more frequently observed in the combined-treatment arm. The survival rate remained similar in both treatment arms. Skin ulceration, nodal involvement, and sex were the most important prognostic factors for both local control and survival. These remained significant after multivariate analysis. The improvement seen in local control by adding chemotherapy to radiotherapy also remained significant after adjusting for prognostic factors in the multivariate analysis. Event-free survival, defined as free of locoregional progression, no colostomy, and no severe side effects or death, showed significant improvement (P = .03) in favor of the combined-treatment modality. The 5-year survival rate was 56% for the whole patient group. CONCLUSION: The concomitant use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy resulted in a significantly improved locoregional control rate and a reduction of the need for colostomy in patients with locally advanced anal cancer without a significant increase in late side effects</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="14"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Seromas and impaired shoulder function are well-known complications after modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer. Early postoperative physiotherapy is a common treatment to avoid shoulder dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate if the frequency of postoperative seromas could be reduced, without increasing shoulder dysfunction, by delayed postoperative shoulder exercises. METHODS: In a prospective study 163 patients with breast cancer undergoing modified radical mastectomy were randomized to physiotherapy starting on postoperative day 1 or day 7. Patients were seen by the surgeons and the physiotherapists during hospital stay and in the outpatient department. Seromas and other complications were registered by the surgeons. The physiotherapists instructed the patients pre- and postoperatively and assessed shoulder function. RESULTS: There was a significantly higher incidence of postoperative seromas in the group of patients that started physiotherapy postoperative day 1 (38%) compared to the group that started physiotherapy postoperative day 7 (22%) (p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant difference between the groups in the late outcome of shoulder function. CONCLUSION: The incidence of seromas after modified radical mastectomy for breast cancer is reduced by delaying shoulder exercises one week postoperatively. Earlier postoperative physiotherapy is not necessary to avoid impaired shoulder function</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="15"><COL><DATA> The study was planned to compare, in a prospective double-blind randomized trial, the efficacy and safety of toremifene (TOR) and tamoxifen (TAM) in post-menopausal patients with advanced breast cancer who have not had prior systemic therapy for advanced disease. Four hundred and fifteen post-menopausal patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive or ER-unknown advanced breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive daily either 60 mg TOR or 40 mg TAM. The patients were stratified to measurable and non-measurable but evaluable groups. They were assessed for response to therapy, time to progression (TTP), time to treatment failure (TTF), response duration, overall survival and drug toxicity. Two hundred and fourteen patients were randomized into TOR and 201 into TAM treatment. The response rate (complete + partial) was 31.3% for TOR and 37.3% for TAM (P = 0.215). The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 6% difference was -15.1% to 3.1%. The median TTP was 7.3 months for TOR and 10.2 months for TAM (P = 0.047). The 95% CI for the hazard ratio of 0.80 was 0.64-1.00. A percentage of the TOR patients (9.8%) and the TAM patients (18.9%) discontinued the treatment prematurely (P = 0.011) for various reasons. Consequently, the median TTF of 6.3 vs 8.5 months did not differ significantly (P = 0.271). The hazard ratio was 0.89 and the subsequent 95% CI 0.73-1.09. The median overall survival was 33.0 months for TOR and 38.7 months for TAM (P = 0.645). The hazard ratio was 0.94 with 95% CI of 0.73-1.22. The transient difference in TTP may be related to an imbalance in ER content of the tumours. When only patients with ER-positive tumours were considered (n = 238), no difference between two treatments was seen (P = 0.578). TAM was associated with an overall slightly higher frequency of adverse drug reactions than TOR (44.3 vs 39.3%) and a higher discontinuation rate due to these events (3.5% vs 0.9%). Treatment-emerged moderate dizziness (P = 0.026) and cataracts (P = 0.026) were more frequent among TAM than among TOR patients. In conclusion, TOR (60 mg day(-1)) and TAM (40 mg day(-1)) are equally effective and safe in the treatment of advanced post-menopausal ER-positive or ER-unknown breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="16"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To determine the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane (DZR) used in a doxorubicin-based combination therapy in advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 1988 and January 1991, 534 patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to two multicenter, double-blind studies (088001 and 088006). Patients received fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) with either DZR (DZR-to-doxorubicin ratio, 10:1) or placebo (PLA) every 3 weeks and were monitored with serial multiplegated acquisition (MUGA) scans. RESULTS: The hazards ratio (HR) of PLA to DZR for a cardiac event, which was predefined ejection fraction changes or congestive heart failure (CHF), was 2.63 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.61 to 4.27; P &lt; .001) for 088001 and 2.00 (95% CI, 1.01 to 3.96; P = .038) for 088006. The objective response rates for 088001 were 46.8% for DZR and 60.5% for PLA, a difference of 14% (95% CI, -25% to -2%; P = .019), and for 088006 were 53.7% for DZR and 49.3% for PLA, a difference of 4% (95% CI, -13% to 22%; P = .63). Time to progression and survival were not significantly different between treatment arms in either study. Toxicities on the DZR arms included lower granulocyte and platelet counts at nadir (P = .009 and P = .004, respectively) and more pain on injection (P = .001), with no difference in the rates of fever, infection, or hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: DZR had a significant cardioprotective effect as measured by noninvasive testing and clinical CHF. One of the two studies (088001) showed a lower response rate with DZR, but time to progression and survival were not significantly different. DZR is the first agent shown to reduce cardiotoxicity from doxorubicin</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="17"><COL><DATA> The incidence and time course of arm morbidity after sector resection and axillary dissection with or without postoperative radiotherapy to the breast was assessed in a prospective randomised trial among 381 patients with stage I breast cancer. At 3-12 months, arm symptoms were reported by 59/110 of the patients who had &gt; or = 10 lymph nodes found in the axillary specimen versus 85/253 in whom &lt; 10 lymph nodes were found (P = 0.002); at 13-36 months, the corresponding figures were 35/106 versus 44/225 (P = 0.001). Postoperative wound complications increased the incidence of arm symptoms at 3-12 months from 104/283 to 39/79 at 3-12 months (P = 0.03). Employed patients and patients &lt; 65 years of age reported arm symptoms at 3-12 months in 86/161 and 94/191 compared to 58/207 and 50/177 among retired patients and patients &gt; or = 65 years of age, respectively (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis at 3-12 months, only young age (relative risk = 0.93 per year of increasing age, 95% CI 0.91-0.97) and the number of lymph nodes found in the axillary specimen (relative risk = 1.11 per lymph node found, 95% CI 1.05-1.18) remained statistically significant. No negative impact on arm morbidity was found by the addition of postoperative radiotherapy only to the breast, either in univariate or multivariate models. We conclude that factors directly related to the extent of the surgical procedure and young age are determinants of arm morbidity after breast preserving treatment for stage I breast cancer. Arm symptoms are most common during the first year after treatment and are reduced over the subsequent 2-3 years by around 40-50%</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="18"><COL><DATA> From May 1985 to June 1992, 375 patients were enrolled in a prospective controlled randomized clinical trial of peri-operative adjuvant chemotherapy (PAC) associated with long-term adjuvant chemo-endocrinotherapy in order to test the effectiveness of reducing the time interval between surgery and chemotherapy. The short-term surgical complications related to PAC are reported in order to verify whether such treatment might negatively affect the results of breast cancer surgery. One hundred and eighty-nine patients were randomly assigned to the peri-operative treatment, and 186 to the control group. Patients undergoing PAC received one course of cyclophosphamide (600 mg/sqm), epidoxorubicin (60 mg/ sqm), and 5-fluorouracil (600 mg/sqm) (CEF) within 48-72 h following surgery. Pathologically node-positive (N+) patients, who were given peri-operative CEF, had five further cycles of CEF alternated with six cycles of CMF (cyclophosphamide 600 mg/sqm, methotrexate 40 mg/sqm, and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/sqm). All the other N+ patients received six cycles of CEF alternated with six cycles of CMF, starting within 30 days of surgery. No significant difference in post-operative morbidity was observed as regards median hospital stay (8 days), number of outpatient dressings (3.5 vs 3), seroma (51 (26.9%) vs 45 (24.2%)), lymphatic drainage (400 ml vs 409 ml), and post-operative infections, both local (10 vs 9) and in extraoperative foci (6 vs 7), in the study and control group, respectively. The toxicity of the peri-operative CEF was mainly gastrointestinal (nausea and vomiting, 55%; stomatitis, 3%), with only a small percentage (9%) reaching grades III-IV. Hair loss was the other main side effect (55%) with baldness in only 3%. Post-operative complications following radical breast cancer surgery seem to be primarily related to operative details (type of incision, accurate nerve-sparing technique, bleeding control, closure of subcutaneous and skin, drainage, aseptic technique) rather than to the one course of PAC</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="19"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To define the role of a 10-Gy boost to the primary tumor in the conservative treatment of early infiltrating breast carcinoma treated by limited surgery and radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1986 and 1992, 1,024 women with early breast carcinoma (&lt; or = 3 cm in diameter) were treated by local excision, axillary dissection, and conventional 50-Gy irradiation given in 20 fractions over 5 weeks and then randomly assigned to receive either no further treatment or a boost of 10 Gy by electrons to the tumor bed. The median follow-up time was 3.3 years as of September 1994. The occurrence of telangiectasia was reported, and the patients were asked to evaluate the cosmetic result. RESULTS: At 5 years, 10 patients of 521 who had received the boost (Kaplan-Meier estimate of local relapse rate, 3.6%) and 20 of 503 who had received no further treatment (Kaplan-Meier estimate of local relapse rate, 4.5%) had developed a local recurrence (P = .044). After adjustment for the main prognostic variables, the relative risk was still significantly lower for the boost group (0.3; range, 0.12 to 0.95). The boost group had a higher rate of grade 1 and 2 telangiectasia (12.4% v 5.9%), but no difference was seen between the two treatment arms in the self-assessment score for the cosmetic result. CONCLUSION: Delivery of a boost of 10 Gy to the tumor bed after 50 Gy to the whole breast following limited surgery significantly reduces the risk of early local recurrence, with no serious deterioration in the cosmetic result. Additional follow-up evaluation will be required to assess the long-term results</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="20"><COL><DATA> The effect of clodronate on bone mineral density (BMD) was studied in 121 post-menopausal breast cancer women without skeletal metastases. In addition, two antioestrogens, tamoxifen and toremifene, were compared in their action on bone mineral density. Patients were randomized to have an adjuvant antioestrogen treatment either 20 mg of tamoxifen or 60 mg of toremifene daily for 3 years. In addition all patients were randomized to have 1600 mg of oral clodronate daily or to act as control subjects. BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck were measured by dual-energy radiographic absorptiometry before therapy and at 1 and 2 years. At 2 years, clodronate with antioestrogens markedly increased BMD in the lumbar spine and femoral neck by 2.9% and 3.7% (P = 0.001 and 0.006 respectively). There were no significant changes in BMD in the patients given antioestrogens only. No significant differences were found between tamoxifen and toremifene on bone mineral density. Clodronate with antioestrogens significantly increased bone mass in the lumbar spine and femoral neck. Both antioestrogens, tamoxifen and toremifene, similarly prevented bone loss in the lumbar spine and femoral neck</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="92"><COL><DATA> Chemotherapy given to patients with metastatic carcinoma of the breast is palliative in intent. Longer regimens would be justified if there was a proven prolongation of symptom response or survival. We conducted a randomised trial to assess the survival of patients receiving up to six extra courses of chemotherapy compared with our conventional regimen of six courses. The patients received either VAC, VEC (vincristine, doxorubicin or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide) or MMM (mitozantrone, methotrexate and mitomycin C) therapy. Patients who had stable disease or were responding after six courses of chemotherapy were randomised to either stop or continue treatment for another six courses. Those patients receiving maintenance therapy had a significantly longer duration of response (P &lt; 0.02) and a significantly longer progression-free survival (P &lt; 0.01). However, there was no survival difference between the two groups. Furthermore, treatment toxicity, which was similar in the two groups, persisted for longer in the maintenance group.

METHODS: Eligible patients (n = 2306) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups following surgery. A total of 771 patients with follow-up data received tamoxifen alone; 767 received methotrexate, fluorouracil, and tamoxifen (MFT); and 768 received cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, and tamoxifen (CMFT). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate disease-free survival, distant disease-free survival, and survival. Reported P values are two-sided. RESULTS: Through 5 years of follow-up, chemotherapy plus tamoxifen resulted in significantly better disease-free survival than tamoxifen alone (90% for MFT versus 85% for tamoxifen [P = .01]; 89% for CMFT versus 85% for tamoxifen [P = .001]). A similar benefit was observed in both distant disease-free survival (92% for MFT versus 87% for tamoxifen [P = .008]; 91% for CMFT versus 87% for tamoxifen [P = .006]) and survival (97% for MFT versus 94% for tamoxifen [P = .05]; 96% for CMFT versus 94% for tamoxifen [P = .03]). Compared with tamoxifen alone, MFT and CMFT reduced the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence after lumpectomy and the risk of recurrence at other local, regional, and distant sites. Risk of treatment failure was reduced after both types of chemotherapy, regardless of tumor size, tumor estrogen or progesterone receptor level, or patient age; however, the reduction was greatest in patients aged 49 years or less. No subgroup of patients evaluated in this study failed to benefit from chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this and other NSABP studies indicate that patients with breast cancer who meet NSABP protocol criteria, regardless of age, lymph node status, tumor size, or estrogen receptor status, are candidates for chemotherapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="94"><COL><DATA> The objective of this study was to compare the antitumor activity of single-agent paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) with that of the 5-fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (FAC) combination by evaluating the extent of residual disease in the breast and regional lymph nodes of patients with breast cancer following four cycles of induction chemotherapy. Patients with histologically confirmed invasive but noninflammatory carcinoma of the breast stages T2-3, N0-1, M0 were eligible to enter the study. Patients were treated with four cycles of either FAC or single-agent paclitaxel before local therapy. Following local therapy, treatment of the two arms was identical. Of 104 operable breast cancer patients who were treated with either regimen, 78 were evaluable for response to preoperative chemotherapy and had undergone local therapy. Age, TNM classification, and estrogen receptor status of the patients were similar in the two groups. Following induction chemotherapy, the extent of disease in the breast and the distribution and number of positive nodes were similar between the two treatment arms. Disease progressed in two patients in the FAC arm and in none in the paclitaxel arm during the induction phase of therapy. A higher fraction of patients had neutropenic fever during the paclitaxel treatment. Initial data from this ongoing randomized study show that paclitaxel alone has comparable anticancer activity with FAC in patients with early breast cancer.

The response rate was 17% in both treatment arms (95% confidence interval 10-26% for formestane and 10-27% for MGA). Disease stabilisation &gt; or = 6 months was seen in 25% of the formestane and 22% of the MGA patients. Time to treatment failure was 120 days in the formestane arm and 111 days in the MGA arm. There was no significant difference between the treatments with regard to response rate and time to treatment failure. Overall toxicity was similar in both arms, but weight gain &gt; 3 kg (P = 0.081) and severe cardiovascular toxicity (P = 0.044) were more frequently observed with MGA, e.g. deep vein thrombosis 0/90 formestane versus 5/81 MGA cases (P = 0.022). Formestane was associated with worsening of hot flushes/sleeping problems (P = 0.051) and mild leucopenia (P = 0.004). In our study, formestane and MGA showed similar antineoplastic activity as second-line hormonal treatment for advanced breast cancer. Both drugs have a specific toxicity profile.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women (n = 1,523) were randomized to National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-18; 759 eligible patients received postoperative AC and 747, preoperative AC. The clinical size of breast and axillary tumors was determined before each of four cycles of AC and before surgery. Tumor response to preoperative therapy was clinically complete (cCR), partial (cPR), stable (cSD), or progressive disease (cPD). Tissue from patients with a cCR was evaluated for a pathologic complete response (pCR). RESULTS: Breast tumor size was reduced in 80% of patients after preoperative therapy; 36% had a cCR. Tumor size and clinical nodal status were independent predictors of cCR. Twenty-six percent of women with a cCR had a pCR. Clinical nodal response occurred in 89% of node-positive patients: 73% had a cCR and 44% of those had a pCR. There was a 37% increase in the incidence of pathologically negative nodes. Before randomization, lumpectomy was proposed for 86% of women with tumors &lt; or = 2 cm, 70% with tumors 2.1 to 5.0 cm, and 3% with tumors &gt; or = 5.1 cm. Clinical tumor size and nodal status influenced the physician&apos;s decision. Overall, 12% more lumpectomies were performed in the preoperative group; in women with tumors &gt; or = 5.1 cm, there was a 175% increase. CONCLUSION: Preoperative therapy reduced the size of most breast tumors and decreased the incidence of positive nodes. The greatest increase in lumpectomy after preoperative therapy occurred in women with tumors &gt; or = 5 cm, since women with tumors less than 5 cm were already lumpectomy candidates. Preoperative therapy should be considered for the initial management of breast tumors judged too large for lumpectomy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="97"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: In the majority of premenopausal breast cancer patients, an adjuvant chemotherapy-induced early menopause occurs, which is known to be a strong predictor of osteoporosis. We present data on the effect of adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) therapy on bone mineral density (BMD) and the efficacy of clodronate on the prevention of bone loss in 148 premenopausal breast cancer patients without skeletal metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive oral clodronate 1,600 mg/d or to a control group. In addition, patients were treated with six cycles of CMF therapy. BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) before therapy and at 1 and 2 years. RESULTS: Changes in the BMD of lumbar spine and femoral neck were -5.9% and -2.0% without clodronate and -2.2% and +0.9% with clodronate at 2 years (P = .0005 and .017, respectively). Patients who developed amenorrhea after chemotherapy had a rapid bone loss, which was significantly reduced by clodronate. In controls, bone loss was 9.5% in the lumbar spine and 4.6% in the femoral neck, while in the clodronate group, bone loss was 5.9% and 0.4%, respectively, at 2 years. Patients with preserved menstruation had only marginal changes in BMD. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure causes rapid bone loss in premenopausal breast cancer patients. Women older than 40 years are at particularly high risk.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (N = 2,305) were randomized to receive either four courses of standard AC therapy (group 1); intensified therapy, in which the same total dose of cyclophosphamide was administered in two courses (group 2); or intensified and increased therapy, in which the total dose of cyclophosphamide was doubled (group 3). The dose and intensity of doxorubicin were similar in all groups. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival were determined using life-table estimates. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in DFS (P = .30) or overall survival (P = .95) among the groups through 5 years. At 5 years, the DFS of women in group 1 was similar to that of women in group 2 (62% v 60%, respectively; P = .43) and to that of women in group 3 (62% v 64%, respectively; P = .59). The 5-year survival of women in group 1 was similar to that of women in group 2 (78% v 77%, respectively; P = .86) and to that of women in group 3 (78% v 77%, respectively; P = .82). Grade 4 toxicity increased in groups 2 and 3. Failure to note a difference in outcome among the groups was unrelated to either differences in amount and intensity of cyclophosphamide or to dose delays and intervals between courses of therapy. CONCLUSION: Intensifying or intensifying and increasing the total dose of cyclophosphamide failed to significantly improve either DFS or overall survival in any group. It was concluded that, outside of a clinical trial, dose-intensification of cyclophosphamide in an AC combination represents inappropriate therapy for women with primary breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="99"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The influence of negative pressure on fluid production and complication rates after axillary dissection for breast cancer was studied in a prospective randomized trial.

Drains were left in place until the preceding 24-hour drainage was &lt; 40 milliliters. The number of days the drains were in place and wound complications (including seroma formation) were recorded. RESULTS: Forty-nine (n = 49) patients were assigned to the treatment gorup and 52 (n = 52) to the control group. MRM was performed on 60 patients (59%) and LAD oN 41 (41%). Eighteen of the 49 patients (37%) in the thrombin group developed a seroma in comparison to 21 of the 52 control patients (40%) (P = 0.71). Significant risk factors for seroma formation included increased age, patient weight, initial 72-hour wound drainage, and LAD. No statistically significant differences were observed between treatment and control groups with respect to time to drain removal, or the incidence of other wound complications. CONCLUSION: Although thrombin by itself appears to have no effect on subsequent seroma development following axillary dissection, the identification of predictive variables will be helpful in designing future trials aimed at reducing the incidence of this common complication of breast surgery</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="101"><COL><DATA> Fibrin sealant (FS) has been used successfully as an effective adhesive and hemostatic agent in a variety of surgical procedures. At the University of Virginia, autologous fibrin sealant is used to reduce the potential accumulation of serous fluid after axillary dissection in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM) for carcinoma of the breast. Unilateral MRM, including level I and II axillary lymph node dissection, was performed upon 21 patients prospectively randomized into treatment and control groups. Surgical procedures between both groups differed only by the application of autologous FS prior to axilla closure in the treatment group. Drainage was collected and measured at 24-hour intervals following the operation. Drains were removed following the measurement of 40 ml or less during a 24-hour interval. Cumulative drainage for the first 3 postoperative days in the treatment group averaged 198 +/- 83 ml compared to 467 +/- 138 ml in the control group (P &lt; 0.0003). Day of drain removal averaged 3.9 +/- 1.7 for the treatment group and 6.9 +/- 1.2 for the control group (P &lt; 0.0001). In the treatment group, there was a reduction in cumulative drainage over the first 3 days of 268 ml or 57 per cent, and there was a reduction in the number of days before drains can be removed of 3.0 days, or 43 per cent. We conclude that local application of FS significantly reduced the total drainage measured in patients undergoing MRM and enabled earlier drain removal</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="156"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the hand-sewn and stapled methods in esophagogastric anastomosis. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: After esophageal resection for cancer, the relative merits of the hand-sewn and the stapled methods of esophagogastric anastomosis, especially regarding leakage and stricture rates, have not adequately been studied. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial was undertaken in 122 patients with squamous cell cancer of the thoracic esophagus who underwent a Lewis-Tanner esophagectomy. Patients were stratified according to esophageal size, based on the diameter of the divided esophagus (&lt; or &gt; or = 30 mm) and then were randomized to have either a hand-sewn or a stapled anastomosis. RESULTS: The mean total operating times (standard error of the mean) when the hand-sewn and the stapled methods were used were 214 (4) minutes and 217 (3.4) minutes, respectively (p = not significant [NS]). The respective in vivo proximal resection margins (standard error of the mean) were 8 (0.4) cm and 7.6 (0.4) cm (p = NS). Leakage rates were 1.6% and 4.9% (p = NS). Excluding hospital deaths, patients with leakage or anastomotic recurrence, and those who received radiation therapy to histologically infiltrated resection margin, anastomotic stricture was found in 5 (9.1%) of 55 patients in the hand-sewn group and 20 (40%) of 50 in the stapler group (p = 0.0003). The difference in stricture rates was significant in small as well as large esophagi. Anastomotic recurrence developed in only one patient in each group. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that both methods were safe, but the stapled technique resulted in more stricture formation</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="158"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: The question whether transhiatal (TH) or transthoracic (TT) resection is most suited for the extirpation of an esophageal cancer remains unresolved. The present study compared the two approaches in a prospective randomized manner. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with carcinoma of the lower third of the esophagus who were clinically fit for either TH or TT resection were prospectively randomized to TH (20 patients) and TT (19 patients) resection. Patients of the two groups were comparable in age, sex, preoperative tumor staging, and pulmonary and cardiac risks for surgery. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the amount of blood loss between the two groups although intraoperative hypotension (systolic &lt;80 mm Hg) occurred more frequently in the TH group (P &lt;0.001). The mean operating time for the TH and TT groups were 174 minutes and 210 minutes, respectively (P &lt;0.001). There was no difference in postoperative ventilatory requirements, cardiopulmonary complication rates, and, mean hospital stay between the two groups. There was no 30-day mortality in either group but there were 3 hospital deaths in the TH group from bronchopneumonia (2 patients) and disseminated malignancy (1 patient). The median survival rates were 16 and 13.5 months, respectively, for the TH and TT groups (P = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Although there was no demonstrable statistical difference in results between TH and TT approaches, the TT approach is preferred as it allowed for a more controlled operation</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="159"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the role of preoperative chemotherapy in squamous cell cancer of the esophagus. METHODS: A prospective randomized trial was undertaken in 147 patients: 74 received preoperative chemotherapy comprising cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil and 73 had surgical therapy alone. End points were cancer and therapy-related deaths. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients (89%) in the chemotherapy group underwent resection compared with 69 (95%) in the control group (p = not significant). Of the 60 patients who had resection after completing the chemotherapy program, 35 (58%) had a significant response, of whom four (6.7%) had a complete pathologic response. Postoperative mortality rates were 8.3% and 8.7% in the chemotherapy and control groups, respectively (p = not significant). Significant downstaging was evident with chemotherapy; curative resections were possible in 67% of these patients compared with 35% in the control group (p = 0.0003). T3 and T4 tumors were found in 67% and 91% of the chemotherapy and control groups, respectively (p = 0.0002). The respective figures for N1 disease were 70% and 88% (p = 0.009). An intent-to-treat analysis of survival showed no significant difference between the two groups. Median survivals were 16.8 and 13 months, respectively (p = 0.17). Of those who completed the chemotherapy and resection, responders fared better than control patients. Median survivals were 42.2 months and 13.8 months, respectively (p = 0.003). Median survival (8.3 months) was worse for nonresponders than for control patients (p = 0.03). The recurrence pattern suggested a significant reduction in locoregional disease with chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative chemotherapy was safe and resulted in significant downstaging and an increased likelihood of curative resection. Survival was not better than that in the surgery-alone group, but responders did fare better than nonresponders</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="160"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To determine whether postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy confers a survival benefit on patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma undergoing radical surgery, we undertook a cooperative, prospective randomized controlled trial. METHODS: A total of 205 patients underwent transthoracic esophagectomy with lymphadenectomy at eleven institutions between December 1988 and July 1991. These patients were prospectively randomized into two groups (100 patients underwent surgery alone and 105 patients had additional two courses of combination chemotherapy with cisplatin (70 mg/m2) and vindesine (3 mg/m2). The two groups did not differ with respect to sex, age, location of tumor, and distributions of pT, pN, pM, or p stage. RESULTS: The 5-year survival was 44.9% in the surgery alone group and 48.1% in the surgery plus chemotherapy group. The relative risk was estimated to be 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.61 to 1.31) in the surgery plus chemotherapy group compared with the surgery alone group. No significant differences in survival were detected between the two groups, even with lymph node stratification. CONCLUSION: Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and vindesine has no additive effect on survival in patients with esophageal cancer compared with surgery alone</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="161"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Drainage methods for the gastric conduit after esophagectomy for carcinoma have been controversial. STUDY DESIGN: In a randomized controlled trial, 92 patients with esophageal carcinoma were randomized to have pyloroplasty or pyloromyotomy as a drainage procedure for the gastric conduit used for esophageal replacement. Only patients who underwent Lewis- Tanner operation or esophagogastrectomy and who had normal pyloroduodenal regions were included. RESULTS: The mean postoperative daily nasogastric output (SEM) were 164 mL (17 mL) in the pyloroplasty group and 179 mL (21 mL) in the pyloromyotomy group (p = not significant). No leakage occurred at the pyloroduodenal region in either group. In both groups, the anastomotic leakage rate was 2 percent, and the in-hospital mortality rate was 7 percent. No significant difference was found in postoperative morbidity and mortality. Gastric outlet obstruction developed in only two patients who underwent pyloromyotomy, and both required reexploration. One died of malignant obstruction of the gastric outlet and aspiration pneumonia. Scintigraphy performed 6 months after operation showed that the median half-life (interquartile range) for gastric emptying was 19 minutes (10 to 24 minutes) in the pyloromyotomy group and 8 minutes (5 to 19 minutes) in the pyloromyotomy group (p = 0.04). Long-term follow-up up to 5 years, however, did not reveal significant differences between the two groups in the type and quantity of food consumed. The incidence of other symptoms such as regurgitation, diarrhea, bile reflux, and dumping, also was no different. CONCLUSIONS: Pyloroplasty and pyloromyotomy were effective and safe drainage procedures for the gastric conduit used for esophageal replacement. The choice depends on the preference and experience of the surgeon. Most patients adapted to their new conduit with time</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="162"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial to compare preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery with surgery alone in patients with stage I and II squamous-cell cancer of the esophagus. METHODS: The preoperative combined therapy consisted of two one-week courses; each involved radiotherapy, in a dose of 18.5 Gy delivered in five fractions of 3.7 Gy each, and 80 mg of cisplatin per square meter of body-surface area, administered 0 to 2 days before the first day of radiotherapy. The surgical plan included one-stage en bloc esophagectomy and proximal gastrectomy by the abdominal and right thoracic routes, to be performed immediately after randomization in the group assigned to surgery alone and two to four weeks after the completion of preoperative chemoradiotherapy in the group assigned to combined therapy. RESULTS: A total of 297 patients entered the study; 11 were found to be ineligible, and 4 were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 282, 139 were assigned to surgery alone and 143 to combined therapy. After a median follow-up of 55.2 months, no significant difference in overall survival was observed; the median survival was 18.6 months for both groups. As compared with the group treated with surgery alone, the group treated preoperatively had longer disease-free survival (P=0.003), a longer interval free of local disease (P=0.01), a lower rate of cancer-related deaths (P=0.002), and a higher frequency of curative resection (P=0.017). However, there were more postoperative deaths (P=0.012) in the group treated preoperatively with chemoradiotherapy. Three prognostic factors were found to influence survival in a multivariate analysis: the disease stage, based on computed tomography; the location of the tumor; and whether the surgical resection was curative. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with squamous-cell esophageal cancer, preoperative chemoradiotherapy did not improve overall survival, but it did prolong disease-free survival and survival free of local disease</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="163"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND/AIMS: A major drawback of laser endoscopy in the palliation of malignant dysphagia is the need for repeated treatments. This study was designed to test whether external beam radiotherapy would reduce the necessity for repeated laser therapy. PATIENTS/METHODS: Sixty seven patients with inoperable oesophageal or gastric cardia cancers and satisfactory swallowing after initial laser recanalisation were randomised to palliative external beam radiotherapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions) or no radiotherapy. All patients underwent a &apos;check&apos; endoscopy five weeks after initial recanalisation and were subsequently reendoscoped only for recurrent dysphagia, which occurred in 59 patients. RESULTS: Dysphagia was relieved equally well in both groups and the improvement was maintained with further endoscopic treatment. The initial dysphagia controlled interval and the duration between procedures required to maintain lifelong palliation (treatment interval) increased from five to nine weeks (median) in the radiotherapy group (p &lt; 0.01 both parameters). Radiotherapy was well tolerated in all but three patients. One perforation occurred and two fistulae opened after dilatation in patients who received radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Additional radiotherapy reduces the necessity for therapeutic endoscopy for a patient&apos;s remaining life. It has an important role in relatively well patients who are likely to survive long enough to benefit</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="164"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: A prospective, randomized comparison of the result of endoscopic laser therapy and that of placement of self-expandable metallic endoprostheses was performed to determine which method provides the best palliation of dysphagia in patients with inoperable esophageal carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients participated in the study. Twenty-three were randomly assigned to undergo plastic-covered stent placement, 19 to undergo uncovered stent placement, and 18 to undergo laser therapy. The quality of swallowing was assessed with the dysphagia score, which ranged from 0 for normal swallowing to 4 for complete dysphagia. RESULTS: The mean improvement in dysphagia score was 2 and ranged from -1 to 3 in patients who underwent placement of plastic-covered stents, was 2 and ranged from 0 to 4 in those who underwent placement of uncovered stents, and was 1 and ranged from 0 to 2 in those who underwent laser therapy. Six of 23 (26%) plastic-covered stents migrated, whereas none of the uncovered stents did so (P &lt; .02). Tumor ingrowth through uncovered stents occurred in five of 19 patients (26%). CONCLUSION: Placement of metallic esophageal endoprostheses is substantially better than endoscopic laser therapy for palliation of dysphagia in patients with inoperable esophageal carcinoma. Use of uncovered and plastic-covered metallic stents provides equal palliation in patients with dysphagia</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="165"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: The present intergroup phase III randomized study compared combined chemotherapy (CT) plus radiotherapy (RT) treatment versus RT only in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two courses of chemotherapy during 50 Gy RT followed by additional two courses of the same CT, versus 64 Gy RT alone were investigated. CT consisted of cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1 [corrected] and fluorouracil (5FU) 1,000 mg/m2/d on days 1 to 4 every 4 weeks with RT and every 3 weeks post-RT. The main objective of the study was to compare overall survival between the two randomized treatment groups. Patients were stratified by tumor size, histology, and degree of weight loss. RESULTS: Sixty-two assessable patients were randomized to receive RT alone, and 61 to the combined arm. Patients characteristics were as follows: squamous cell cancer, 90% versus 85%; weight loss greater than 10 lb, 61% versus 69%; and tumor size, &gt; or = 5 cm, 82% versus 80% on the RT and CT-RT arms, respectively. Systemic side effects, which consisted of nausea, vomiting, and renal and myelosuppression, occurred more frequently on the combined arm, while local side effects were similar in both groups. With a minimum follow-up time of 5 years for all patients, the median survival duration was 14.1 months and the 5-year survival rate was 27% in the combined treatment group, while the median survival duration was 9.3 months with no patients alive at 5 years in the RT-alone group (P &lt; .0001). Additional patients (69) were treated with the same combined therapy and were analyzed. The results of the last group confirmed all of the results obtained with combined CT-RT in the randomized trial, with a median survival duration of 17.2 months and 3-year survival rate of 30%.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred seventy-four patients with adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma were randomized and analyzed for survival, tumor response, toxicity, and quality of life (QL). RESULTS: The overall response rate was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36% to 54%) with ECF and 21% (95% CI, 13% to 29%) with FAMTX (P = .0002). Toxicity was tolerable and there were only three toxic deaths. The FAMTX regimen caused more hematologic toxicity and serious infections, but ECF caused more emesis and alopecia. The median survival duration was 8.9 months with ECF and 5.7 months with FAMTX (P = .0009); at 1 year, 36% (95% CI, 27% to 45%) of ECF and 21% (95% CI, 14% to 29%) of FAMTX patients were alive. The median failure-free survival duration was 7.4 months with ECF and 3.4 months with FAMTX (P = .00006). The global QL scores were better for ECF at 24 weeks, but the remaining QL data showed no differences between either arm of the study. Hospital-based cost analysis on a subset of patients was similar for each arm and translated into an increment cost of $975 per life-year gained. CONCLUSION: The ECF regimen results in a survival and response advantage, tolerable toxicity, better QL and cost-effectiveness compared with FAMTX chemotherapy.

This study compares laparoscopic and open colonic resection in a randomized fashion with special reference to outcome, complications and immunomodulation. METHODS: The clinical course, assessment of convalescence parameters, immunofunction and pathological evaluation of the operative specimen were compared in 34 patients with colonic adenocarcinoma. The patients were randomized to either laparoscopic surgery (group 1, n = 18) or open surgery (group 2, n = 16). As five patients were excluded the number of patients was 15 in group 1 and 14 in group 2. RESULTS: Patients in group 1 were discharged earlier (P &lt; 0.05) and suffered less pain (P &lt; 0.01 at rest, P &lt; 0.05 during coughing and mobilization). Surgery was equally radical in the two groups. Intraoperative bleeding, postoperative reduction in pulmonary function, and level of fatigue were identical in the two groups.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred seventeen patients with high-risk stage II or stage III colon cancer were randomly assigned 3 to 4 weeks following surgery to receive either (1) chemotherapy with six cycles of 5FU (425 mg/m2) plus leucovorin (20 mg/m2) by rapid intravenous injection daily for 5 consecutive days every 4 to 5 weeks, or (2) observation. RESULTS: The median follow-up duration is 72 months for patients still alive. Patients who received postoperative 5FU plus leucovorin experienced significant improvement in time to relapse (P &lt; .01) and survival (P = .02) compared with control patients treated with surgery alone. Stomatitis, diarrhea, and leukopenia were the predominant chemotherapy toxicities. There were no treatment-related deaths. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that intensive-course 5FU plus low-dose leucovorin is effective in preventing tumor relapse and improving survival in patients with high-risk colon cancer.

DESIGN: Univariate and multivariate retrospective analyses of survival associated with blood transfusion in patients who had taken part in a randomised multicentre trial (SAKK 40/81). SETTING: Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK). SUBJECTS: 450 patients, 104 of whom (23%) did not have a blood transfusion and 346 of whom (77%) did. INTERVENTIONS: Resection of colorectal cancer and portal infusion of adjuvant chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease-free and overall survival. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 9 years, and patients who had received transfusions had significantly shorter disease-free survival time (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.60; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.38). The transfusion of more than 4 units of blood products was associated with a significantly higher risk (HR = 2.52; 95% CI 1.43 to 4.44). Patients who had no transfusion and who had been assigned to have portal infusion of chemotherapy had a significantly longer disease-free survival time than patients who had transfusion but no chemotherapy (HR = 0.38; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.77). CONCLUSIONS: There was an adverse association between blood transfusion and disease-free survival.

METHODS: Between March 1987 and February 1990, we randomly assigned 1168 patients younger than 80 years of age who had resectable rectal cancer to undergo preoperative irradiation (25 Gy delivered in five fractions in one week) followed by surgery within one week or to have surgery alone. RESULTS: The irradiation did not increase postoperative mortality. After five years of follow-up, the rate of local recurrence was 11 percent (63 of 553 patients) in the group that received radiotherapy before surgery and 27 percent (150 of 557) in the group treated with surgery alone (P&lt;0.001).

Only a few prospective, randomized clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the potential preventive effects of dietary fiber or calcium in patients with an increased risk for the development or recurrence of colorectal cancer. We designed and conducted a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial involving supplementation of fiber and calcium intake and measurements of [3H]thymidine labeling index (LI) percentages in rectal mucosal biopsies obtained from patients with resected colorectal adenomas to examine the potential mechanisms by which dietary interventions might reduce colorectal cancer risk. We performed a randomized, double-blinded, Phase II study, using a factorial design to measure the effects of supplemental dietary wheat bran fiber (2.0 or 13.5 g/day) and calcium carbonate (250 or 1500 mg/day elemental calcium) supplementation on [3H]thymidine LI percentages in rectal mucosal crypts and 24-h in vitro outgrowth cultures. Measurements were made at baseline randomization (i.e., after a 3-month placebo run-in period using 2.0 g of wheat bran fiber plus 250 mg of calcium carbonate) and after 3 and 9 months on treatment in 100 randomized participants who had a history of colon adenoma resection. Neither the wheat bran fiber nor the calcium carbonate supplements significantly reduced [3H]thymidine LI percentages in rectal mucosal crypts (total or compartmental analysis) or 24-h in vitro outgrowth cultures at either 3 or 9 months of daily supplementation in the 93 evaluable participants. We conclude that 9 months of high-dose wheat bran fiber and calcium carbonate supplementation in study participants with a history of recently resected colorectal adenomas does not have a significant effect on cellular proliferation rates in rectal mucosal biopsies, comparing 3- and 9-month results to baseline results. Ultimately, there is great need for the evaluation of these two different nutrient interventions in the setting of Phase III studies wherein adenomatous polyp recurrence, rather than a rectal mucosal biomarker, serves as the primary end point</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="252"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: There is controversy whether adjuvant radiotherapy should be given before or after surgery for locally advanced, resectable rectal cancer. Preoperative radiotherapy substantially reduces local recurrence rates but may increase postoperative complications. In addition, patients found to have early cancers are treated unnecessarily. This study is a randomized trial of postoperative radiotherapy in patients who had a potentially curative resection for locally advanced rectal carcinoma. METHODS: Following complete excision of a Dukes B or C rectal cancer, 172 patients were randomized to adjuvant radiotherapy (46 Gy 5 days per week in 30-38 days) (84 patients) or controls (88 patients).

Acute toxicity following radiotherapy included diarrhoea (20 per cent), cystitis (13 per cent), delayed wound healing (7 per cent), pneumonia (5 per cent) and seizures (1 per cent). Late complications included reoperation for small bowel obstruction (5 per cent), chronic diarrhoea (20 per cent), chronic cystitis (12 per cent) and persistent perineal sinus (9 per cent). In the group who had surgery alone, late morbidity was found in 11 per cent.

Physiologic characteristics of the colonic J-pouch were compared with those of the traditional straight anastomosis and related to clinical function. METHOD: Patients with total mesorectal excision for carcinoma were randomized to either a straight (n = 23) or a colonic pouch anastomosis (n = 23). The patients were examined before and at one year after surgery (n = 42), which included laboratory studies, and a questionnaire regarding anorectal function was completed. RESULTS: Preoperative compliance of the rectum was restored after surgery in the pouch group, 2.9 (2.2-3.4) ml/cm H2O, but there was a significant decrease after surgery in the straight anastomosis group, 1.9 (1.1-2.3) P &lt; 0.001 (median (interquartile range)). Sphincter pressures in both groups were similar. In a multiple regression analysis, high compliance was associated with favorable clinical function, and hypermotility of the anal canal was associated with adverse clinical function.

RESULTS: Patients operated on by surgeons who were certified specialists for at least 10 years had a lower risk of local recurrence (relative risk 0.8 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 0.6-1.0)) and death from rectal cancer (relative risk 0.8 (95 per cent c.i. 0.7-0.9)). The risk was also lower for patients operated on in university hospitals (relative risk of local recurrence 0.7 (95 per cent c.i. 0.5-0.9), relative risk of death from rectal cancer 0.8 (95 per cent c.i. 0.7-1.0)) compared with community hospitals, although the results in some community hospitals were similar to those in university hospitals. The proportional reduction of local recurrence rate after preoperative radiotherapy was not significantly different for the studied institutions and surgeons. CONCLUSION: There was a significant surgeon-related variation in patient outcome, which is probably related to the surgical technique. Although improved technique may reduce the local recurrence rate, preoperative radiotherapy is still beneficial concerning local control and survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="287"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Protocol R-03 was designed to determine the worth of preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the management of operable rectal cancer. METHODS: Thus far, 116 patients of an eventual 900 with primary operable rectal cancer have been randomized to receive multimodality therapy to begin preoperatively (59 patients) or identical therapy beginning after curative surgery (57). All patients received seven cycles of 5-fluorouracil (FU)/leucovorin (LV) chemotherapy. Cycles 1 and 4 through 7 used a high-dose weekly FU regimen. In Cycles 2 and 3, FU and low-dose LV chemotherapy was given during the first and fifth week of radiation therapy (5,040 cGy). The preoperative arm (Group 1) received the first three cycles of chemotherapy and all radiation therapy before surgery. The postoperative arm (Group 2) received all radiation and chemotherapy after surgery. Primary study end points included disease-free survival and survival. Secondary end points included local recurrence, primary tumor response to combination therapy, tumor downstaging, and sphincter preservation. RESULTS: Overall treatment-related toxicity was similar in both groups. Although seven preoperative patients had events after randomization that precluded surgery, eight events occurred during an equivalent follow-up period in the postoperative group. No patient was deemed inoperable because of progressive local disease. Sphincter-saving surgery was intended in 31 percent of Group 1 patients and 33 percent of Group 2 patients at the time of randomization. Such surgery was actually performed in 50 percent of the preoperatively treated patients and 33 percent of the postoperatively treated patients. The use of protective colostomy in patients undergoing sphincter-sparing surgery and the development of perioperative complications in all surgical patients were similar in both groups. There was evidence of tumor downstaging in evaluable patients undergoing preoperative therapy, with 8 percent of Group 1 patients having had a pathologic complete response. CONCLUSION: These data do suggest that the preoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimen used are, at least, as safe and tolerable as standard postoperative treatment. There is presently a trend to tumor downstaging and sphincter preservation in the preoperative arm. Whether this arm will have greater or lesser survival and long-term toxicity awaits the completion of this relevant study</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="293"><COL><DATA> To evaluate the significance of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy using mitomycin C (MMC) and UFT (tegafur and uracil) in combination, the Japanese Foundation for Multidisciplinary Treatment of Cancer conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial with 834 patients who had undergone curative resection for rectal cancer (T3 or T4 tumors and/or N1, N2, or N3 disease). The patients were randomly allocated to a treatment group (MMC/UFT, 416 patients) and a control group (surgery only, 418 patients). For patients in the treatment group, 20 mg of MMC was sprinkled on the operating field upon completion of surgery. MMC was intravenously injected at 6 mg/m2 on day 7, and then each month after surgery for 6 months. UFT was administered orally at 400 mg/day for 1 year. Although no difference was observed in the 5-year survival rate between the two groups, the 5-year disease-free survival rate in the MMC/UFT group was 69.1%, which was significantly higher than in the control group (59.3%, P = .005). The 5-year cumulative local recurrence rate was significantly lower in the MMC/UFT group (11.6%) than in the control group (19.0%) (P = .0071). We conclude that the adjuvant use of long-term oral UFT and intermittent intravenous MMC improves the disease-free survival rate of patients with curatively resected rectal cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="295"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Functional outcome after rectal excision with coloanal anastomosis is improved by construction of a colonic J pouch. Present prospective randomized studies lack follow-up beyond 1 year. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical outcome at both short- and long-term follow-up. METHODS: Forty patients with low rectal cancer were randomized prospectively to either J colonic pouch-anal anastomosis or a straight coloanal anastomosis. Clinical assessments were performed 3, 12 and 24 months after colostomy closure using a standard questionnaire and physical examination. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the complication rate between the two groups. There was a significant (P &lt; 0.01) improvement in frequency of defaecation at 3, 12 and 24 months for patients with a reservoir. Similarly, fragmentation (clustering of stools) was significantly less at 3 and 12 months (P &lt; 0.01) in the reservoir group, and incontinence occurred less frequently in the first year (P = 0.09). By 24 months no patient in either group suffered from major or minor incontinence. CONCLUSION: The functional improvement gained from a colonic reservoir in coloanal anastomosis continues to benefit the patient for at least 2 years</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="296"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Improved functional results can be obtained by construction of a colonic J-pouch after coloanal anastomosis. Variability in pouch size following coloanal anastomosis is prevalent in current literature. In this study, the authors compare clinical bowel function after complete rectal excision with coloanal anastomosis for patients with rectal carcinoma using either a small 6-cm or a large 10-cm colonic J-pouch anastomosis. The clinical outcome is assessed both at short-term and long-term follow-up. METHODS: Fifty-nine consecutive patients with rectal cancers 4 to 8 cm from the anal verge were recruited into the study. Patients were randomized intraoperatively to either a 6-cm J-pouch group or a 10-cm J-pouch group. Clinical assessments were performed prospectively at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively, following colostomy closure. Clinical parameters such as frequency, urgency, continence, and laxative and enema use were assessed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: There was no statistical differences in the mean defecation frequency, urgency, and fecal continence between the two groups at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. In the first year, laxative and enema use between the two groups was negligible; however at two years, 30 percent of patients with a large reservoir compared with 10 percent of patients in the small-pouch group required laxative and/or enema for constipation and evacuation of bowels. CONCLUSION: Similar clinical results can be expected from patients with either small or large reservoirs at one year. However, with long-term follow-up, patients with a large reservoir are more likely to require medication for constipation and evacuation. To avoid these inconveniences a small reservoir is advocated for patients undergoing coloanal anastomosis</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="311"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of covering colostomy for patients undergoing low anterior resection for rectal neoplasms. DESIGN: Prospective randomised study. SETTING: Two university hospitals, Finland. SUBJECTS: 38 patients with air-tight stapled end-to-end anastomoses and complete anastomotic tissue rings were randomly allocated to have a covering colostomy (n = 19) or not. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative mortality, anastomotic leaks, reoperations for leaks. RESULTS: The clinical leak rate was 24% (9/38) and six patients (16%) had radiological leaks. The total number of leaks (clinical and radiological together) was similar in the two groups, 7/19 compared with 8/19, respectively. There were fewer clinical leaks in the colostomy group (3/19; 16% compared with 6/19; 32%), but the difference was not significant. Reoperations for leaks were necessary more often in patients who did not have a covering colostomy (6/19; 32% compared with 1/19; 5%, p = 0.09). Two patients who did not have a stoma died from the infective complications of their leaks and one died of heart failure in the colostomy group. One patient who had not been given a stoma initially was left with a permanent colostomy after a leak. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a covering colostomy does not reduce the leak rate after low anterior resection, but prevents most of the severe infective consequences of the leaks</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="324"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: The combination of radiation therapy with fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy is generally accepted as appropriate postoperative therapy for patients with adenocarcinomas of the rectum that extend through the bowel wall or with lymph nodes positive for tumor. We attempted to determine whether the efficacy of this postoperative therapy could be improved by the addition of leucovorin and/or levamisole. METHODS: A total of 1,696 patients were randomized and eligible for treatment with one of four treatment schemes. All patients received two cycles of bolus 5-FU-based systemic chemotherapy followed by pelvic radiation therapy with chemotherapy and two more cycles of the same systemic chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was either 5-FU alone, 5-FU with leucovorin, 5-FU with levamisole, or 5-FU with leucovorin and levamisole. RESULTS: With a median follow-up duration of 48 months, there is no statistically significant advantage to any of the treatment regimens compared with bolus 5-FU alone. There is evidence of increased gastrointestinal toxicity with the three-drug combination compared with bolus 5-FU alone. Statistical analysis suggests it is very unlikely that either levamisole-containing combination will be shown to be of value with further follow-up evaluation. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence at present for a beneficial effect of levamisole in the adjuvant treatment of rectal cancer. Definitive evaluation of the effect of the addition of leucovorin to 5-FU and pelvic radiation will require further follow-up evaluation</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="326"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether a 1-month regimen of postoperative radiotherapy combined with 5-fluorouracil could reduce the local recurrence rate and improve survival in patients with Dukes B and C rectal cancer. METHODS: One hundred and forty-four patients were randomized to surgery alone or surgery combined with postoperative radiotherapy (46 Gy) and bolus 5-fluorouracil 30 min before six of the radiotherapy fractions. One hundred and thirty-six patients were eligible. RESULTS: The adjuvant treatment was well tolerated. After an observation time of 4-8 years, patients in the adjuvant treatment group had a cumulative local recurrence rate of 12 per cent compared with 30 per cent in the group that had surgery only (P = 0.01). The 5-year recurrence-free and overall survival rate was 64 per cent in the adjuvant group compared with 46 per cent (P = 0.01) and 50 per cent (P = 0.05) respectively in the surgery group. The adjusted relative risk of recurrence and death for the adjuvant group was 0.48 (95 per cent confidence interval 0.28-0.82) and 0.56 (0.33-0.94) respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that successful early feeding would lead to a shorter duration of hospitalization and, therefore, would be more cost-effective. PATIENTS: Fifty-eight patients with elective colorectal surgery. METHODS: Patients were prospectively randomized to 1 of 2 postoperative treatment arms: early feeding (EF group, n = 29) and traditional feeding (TF group, n = 29). All patients in the EF group began a liquid diet on the first postoperative day and were advanced to a regular diet when they consumed 1000 mL in 24 hours. All patients in the TF group began a liquid diet after resolution of the postoperative ileus and were advanced to a regular diet after consuming 1000 mL in 24 hours. Patients were dismissed after tolerating two thirds of the regular diet. Both groups had intraoperative orogastric tubes that were removed at the end of surgery. Nasogastric tubes were inserted for persistent postoperative vomiting. RESULTS: No significant differences were noted in age, types of procedures, or in prior abdominal surgery in either group. No significant differences were seen in rates of nausea (55% in EF vs 50% in TF group) or vomiting (48% in EF vs 33% in TF group). One patient in the EF group had aspiration pneumonia, and anastomotic leak resulted in sepsis and eventual death of 1 patient in the TF group. No significant difference was observed in length of hospital stay between the 2 groups (mean +/- SD, 7.2 +/- 3.3 days in EF vs 8.1 +/- 2.3 days in TF group). CONCLUSIONS: Early oral feeding after elective colorectal surgery is safe. Most of the patients tolerated EF; however, there was no significant difference in duration of hospitalization in these patients</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="361"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Several studies suggest that perioperative blood transfusion is a major independent risk factor for postoperative bacterial infections. Transfusion-induced immunosuppression is thought to mediate this effect. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In a randomized clinical trial comprising 697 patients with colorectal cancer, the relationship between two types of red cell components (buffy coat-depleted packed red cells and white cell-reduced [filtered] packed red cells) and postoperative bacterial infections was analyzed. RESULTS: Both types of red cells appeared to be associated with a greater incidence of postoperative infection than was no transfusion (39 vs. 24%, p &lt; 0.01). A dose-response relationship could be demonstrated: the corrected relative risk was 1.6 for 1 to 3 units of red cells and 3.6 for more than 3 units. Multivariate analyses identified the transfusion of red cells and tumor location as the only significant independent risk factors for postoperative bacterial infection. CONCLUSION: Because allogeneic white cells, plasma, microaggregates, citrate, and platelets could be ruled out as risk factors for transfusion-associated postoperative infections, it is hypothesized that the transfusion of red cells is a potentially detrimental factor that transiently impairs the clearance of bacteria by phagocytic cells</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="364"><COL><DATA> In a prospective randomised study, 597 patients subjected to curative surgery for colorectal cancer were allocated to either a group with frequent follow-up or a control group with follow-up every 5 years. The pattern of recurrence is reviewed. An equal number of recurrences was detected in the two groups, but the recurrence was diagnosed 9 months earlier in patients followed frequently, and the diagnostic characteristics of various tests dependent upon how often they were used. It is unlikely that frequent follow-up after curative surgery for colorectal cancer has a large positive influence upon survival, but a small benefit from an intensive follow-up program cannot be ruled out. The present results indicate that clinical examination, digital rectal examination, proctoscopy, colonoscopy and chest x-ray should be included in such a programme, whereas others (blood haemoglobin, faecal occult blood test, double contrast braium enema, serum alanine aminotransferase, and serum bilirubin) should be avoided, having a low sensitivity for detecting recurrent colorectal cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="365"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: The possible benefit for patients from follow-up examinations after curative surgery for colorectal cancer is unproven.

Patients were randomized to frequent follow-up (group 1) or virtually no follow-up (group 2) with examinations at 5 and 10 years. RESULTS: Group 1 comprised 290 patients, group 2 contained 307. Recurrence was equally frequent (26 per cent), but the time of diagnosis was 9 months earlier in group 1; also, more recurrences were asymptomatic in group 1 and more patients had new surgery with curative intent (P = 0.02). However, no improvement in overall survival or in cancer-related survival resulted.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred patients with advanced colorectal cancer received PVI 5-FU 300 mg/m2/day for a maximum of 24 weeks and were randomised to PVI 5-FU alone or PVI 5-FU + MMC 10 mg/m2 (7 mg/m2 from June 1995) 6 weekly for 4 courses. RESULTS: Overall response was 54% (95% confidence interval [CI] 44.1%-63.9%) with PVI 5-FU + MMC compared to 38% (95% CI: 28.3%-47.7%) for PVI 5-FU alone (P = 0.024). The median failure free survival was 7.9 months in PVI 5-FU plus MMC and 5.4 months with PVI 5-FU alone (P = 0.033) and at one year 31.9% for the combination compared to 17.7% for PVI 5-FU alone. Median survival was 14 months with MMC and 15 months in 5-FU alone; one-year survival 51.7% vs. 57.2%. PVI 5-FU + MMC caused more overall haematological toxicity but CTC grades 3/4 was increased only for thrombocytopaenia. Two patients treated with a cumulative dose of MMC of 40 mg/m2 developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome warranting the reduction in cumulative MMC dose to 28 mg/m2. The global QL scores were better for PVI 5-FU + MMC arm at 24 weeks, but the remaining QL data showed no differences. CONCLUSIONS: PVI 5-FU + MMC results in failure-free survival and response advantage, tolerable toxicity and better QL when compared to PVI 5-FU alone but no overall survival advantage.

Therefore, we tested chronomodulated infusion (administered to coincide with relevant circadian rhythms) of oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and folinic acid compared with a constant-rate infusion method. The combination of three drugs was delivered for 5-day courses with 16-day intervals. METHODS: We expected chronotherapy to increase objective response rate by 20% compared with constant-rate infusion. We tested this effect in a randomised multicentre trial involving patients with previously untreated metastases from colorectal cancer who were enrolled at nine institutions in three countries. 93 patients were assigned chronotherapy and 93 were assigned constant-rate infusion via multichannel programmable ambulatory pumps. The trial was interrupted when a significant difference in main outcome was reached. All data were analysed by intention to treat. FINDINGS: On enrollment, we found significant imbalances in two characteristics-abdominal gland or bone metastases (constant-rate infusion two patients, chronotherapy ten patients) and relapse from surgically treated metastases (constant-rate infusion seven patients, chronotherapy 22 patients). An objective response was obtained in 47 (51%) of the chronotherapy group, and in 27 (29%) of the constant-rate group (difference 21.5% [95% CI 13.7-31.2], p = 0.003). Chronotherapy reduced five-fold the rate of severe mucosal toxicity (14% vs 76%, p &lt; 0.0001) and halved that of functional impairment from peripheral sensitive neuropathy (16% vs 31%, difference 15.0% [9.5-25.7], p &lt; 0.01). Median time to treatment failure was 6.4 months on chronotherapy and 4.9 months on constant-rate infusion (p = 0.006), and 24% of the patients from the constant-rate infusion group received chronotherapy after failure. With a minimum follow-up of 3 years, median survival times and 3-year survival were similar in both groups (15.9 vs 16.9 months and 22% vs 21%, respectively). INTERPRETATION: Chronotherapy was significantly less toxic and more effective than constant-rate infusion.

METHODS: We compared QoL in 135 CLM patients managed by symptom control (n = 49 patients), systemic fluorouracil (5FU)/folinic acid (n = 35), or hepatic arterial floxuridine (FUDR) (n = 51). Full blood count and liver function tests, World Health Organization (WHO) toxicity criteria, and QoL (Rotterdam Symptom Checklist [RSC], the Sickness Impact Profile [SIP], and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale [HAD]) were measured monthly in all patients. RESULTS: The HAD anxiety score was significantly increased in symptom control compared with chemotherapy patients 1 month after randomization. There was a significant increase in RSC physical score (repeated measures, P = .05), and in scores for sore mouth (P &lt; .01), dry mouth (P &lt; .01), and tingling hands and feet (P &lt; .01) in systemic chemotherapy compared with symptom control patients. Significant QoL differences (repeated measures and Mann-Whitney U [MWU]) between HAI and symptom control patients were not detected. Systemic chemotherapy patients lived for significantly longer (log-rank test, P &lt; or = .0001) with abnormal HAD anxiety, RSC psychosocial, or RSC sore mouth scores compared with HAI patients, but there were no overall survival differences.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: As have been shown in animal experiments as well as in clinical investigations, cryosurgery has been used for the treatment of many benign and malignant conditions. For the first time, this report summarizes a 10-year follow-up clinical experience with cryosurgery for treatment of LM from 1983 to 1992. METHODS: One hundred twenty-three patients with LM (87 males and 36 females, a ratio 2.4:1.0; age, 41.3 +/- 12.1 years) were stratified and entered into a long-term prospective, randomized clinical trial for cryogenic surgery in group 1 (n = 63) and conventional surgical techniques in group 2 (control subjects, n = 60). Principally, a self-constructed cryogenic clamp was used for hepatic cryoresection with preliminary freezing of the margin resection by a cryosurgical system &quot;Cryoelectronic-2&quot; or &quot;Cryoelectronic-4&quot;. Hepatic cryoextirpation (cryoablation) and hepatic cryodestruction were performed by means of probes of different roughly disk design from phi 5 mm to 55 mm by volume of frozen zone of 40 cm3 to 180 cm3 for approximately 7 to 32 minutes. RESULTS: In most cases in group 1 and group 2, LM were based on colorectal cancers (65% vs. 68%). The hepatic cryosurgical procedures in group 1 included cryoextirpation (29 patients, 46%), cryoresection (20 patients, 32%), and cryodestruction (14 patients, 22%) solely. Clinical and laboratory parameters showed that the curative effects were significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2. The 3-year survival rate was in group 1 and group 2 (60% vs. 51%, respectively). The 5-year survival rate was 44% in group 1 and 36% in group 2. Twelve patients (19%) versus 5 patients (8%) in group 1 and group 2, respectively, survived 10 years. The disease-free survival was in group 1 and group 2 (30% vs. 18%, respectively). During a follow-up period, recurrence in the liver was observed in 54 patients (85%) in group 1 and in 57 patients (95%) in control subjects. After a 10-year follow-up period in group 1 and group 2, 9 patients (14%) versus 3 patients (5%) remained disease free, 3 patients (4%) versus 2 patients (3%) were surviving with disease, and 51 patients (81%) versus 55 patients (92%) died. CONCLUSIONS: The data of this 10-year prospective, randomized clinical trial suggest that hepatic cryosurgery is effective in the treatment of resectable and nonresectable LM. The results show intraoperative tumor reduction (&gt; or = 90% &lt; or = 97%) and extended higher survival in these patients.

The maximal number of cycles foreseen in both groups was eight. Cardiotoxicity of the regimens was monitored by serial LVEF determinations. 106 patients entered this study, 50 (45 evaluable for activity) randomised to group A, and 56 (54 evaluable for activity) to group B. The groups were well balanced for age, sex, performance status and histological type. In group A, there was 1 complete response (CR) and 12 partial responses (PR), the overall response being 13/45 (29%); in group B, there were 7 CRs and 22 PRs, the overall response being 29/54 (54%). The difference between the overall response was statistically significant (chi 2 = 6.19, P &lt; 0.025). The epirubicin-cisplatin regimen was found to be more toxic for platelets and more emetogenic, but cardiotoxicity, either acute or cumulative, was not found to be a major problem in both groups. However, a complete responder receiving a cumulative epirubicin dose of 1440 mg/m2 died from congestive heart failure after a disease-free interval of 27 months.

Four hundred and fifteen post-menopausal patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive or ER-unknown advanced breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive daily either 60 mg TOR or 40 mg TAM. The patients were stratified to measurable and non-measurable but evaluable groups. They were assessed for response to therapy, time to progression (TTP), time to treatment failure (TTF), response duration, overall survival and drug toxicity. Two hundred and fourteen patients were randomized into TOR and 201 into TAM treatment. The response rate (complete + partial) was 31.3% for TOR and 37.3% for TAM (P = 0.215). The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 6% difference was -15.1% to 3.1%. The median TTP was 7.3 months for TOR and 10.2 months for TAM (P = 0.047). The 95% CI for the hazard ratio of 0.80 was 0.64-1.00. A percentage of the TOR patients (9.8%) and the TAM patients (18.9%) discontinued the treatment prematurely (P = 0.011) for various reasons. Consequently, the median TTF of 6.3 vs 8.5 months did not differ significantly (P = 0.271). The hazard ratio was 0.89 and the subsequent 95% CI 0.73-1.09. The median overall survival was 33.0 months for TOR and 38.7 months for TAM (P = 0.645). The hazard ratio was 0.94 with 95% CI of 0.73-1.22. The transient difference in TTP may be related to an imbalance in ER content of the tumours. When only patients with ER-positive tumours were considered (n = 238), no difference between two treatments was seen (P = 0.578). TAM was associated with an overall slightly higher frequency of adverse drug reactions than TOR (44.3 vs 39.3%) and a higher discontinuation rate due to these events (3.5% vs 0.9%). Treatment-emerged moderate dizziness (P = 0.026) and cataracts (P = 0.026) were more frequent among TAM than among TOR patients. In conclusion, TOR (60 mg day(-1)) and TAM (40 mg day(-1)) are equally effective and safe in the treatment of advanced post-menopausal ER-positive or ER-unknown breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="566"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To determine the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane (DZR) used in a doxorubicin-based combination therapy in advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 1988 and January 1991, 534 patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to two multicenter, double-blind studies (088001 and 088006). Patients received fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) with either DZR (DZR-to-doxorubicin ratio, 10:1) or placebo (PLA) every 3 weeks and were monitored with serial multiplegated acquisition (MUGA) scans. RESULTS: The hazards ratio (HR) of PLA to DZR for a cardiac event, which was predefined ejection fraction changes or congestive heart failure (CHF), was 2.63 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.61 to 4.27; P &lt; .001) for 088001 and 2.00 (95% CI, 1.01 to 3.96; P = .038) for 088006. The objective response rates for 088001 were 46.8% for DZR and 60.5% for PLA, a difference of 14% (95% CI, -25% to -2%; P = .019), and for 088006 were 53.7% for DZR and 49.3% for PLA, a difference of 4% (95% CI, -13% to 22%; P = .63). Time to progression and survival were not significantly different between treatment arms in either study. Toxicities on the DZR arms included lower granulocyte and platelet counts at nadir (P = .009 and P = .004, respectively) and more pain on injection (P = .001), with no difference in the rates of fever, infection, or hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: DZR had a significant cardioprotective effect as measured by noninvasive testing and clinical CHF. One of the two studies (088001) showed a lower response rate with DZR, but time to progression and survival were not significantly different. DZR is the first agent shown to reduce cardiotoxicity from doxorubicin</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="567"><COL><DATA> The incidence and time course of arm morbidity after sector resection and axillary dissection with or without postoperative radiotherapy to the breast was assessed in a prospective randomised trial among 381 patients with stage I breast cancer.

Postoperative wound complications increased the incidence of arm symptoms at 3-12 months from 104/283 to 39/79 at 3-12 months (P = 0.03). Employed patients and patients &lt; 65 years of age reported arm symptoms at 3-12 months in 86/161 and 94/191 compared to 58/207 and 50/177 among retired patients and patients &gt; or = 65 years of age, respectively (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis at 3-12 months, only young age (relative risk = 0.93 per year of increasing age, 95% CI 0.91-0.97) and the number of lymph nodes found in the axillary specimen (relative risk = 1.11 per lymph node found, 95% CI 1.05-1.18) remained statistically significant. No negative impact on arm morbidity was found by the addition of postoperative radiotherapy only to the breast, either in univariate or multivariate models. We conclude that factors directly related to the extent of the surgical procedure and young age are determinants of arm morbidity after breast preserving treatment for stage I breast cancer.

Four hundred and fifteen post-menopausal patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive or ER-unknown advanced breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive daily either 60 mg TOR or 40 mg TAM. The patients were stratified to measurable and non-measurable but evaluable groups. They were assessed for response to therapy, time to progression (TTP), time to treatment failure (TTF), response duration, overall survival and drug toxicity. Two hundred and fourteen patients were randomized into TOR and 201 into TAM treatment. The response rate (complete + partial) was 31.3% for TOR and 37.3% for TAM (P = 0.215). The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 6% difference was -15.1% to 3.1%. The median TTP was 7.3 months for TOR and 10.2 months for TAM (P = 0.047). The 95% CI for the hazard ratio of 0.80 was 0.64-1.00. A percentage of the TOR patients (9.8%) and the TAM patients (18.9%) discontinued the treatment prematurely (P = 0.011) for various reasons. Consequently, the median TTF of 6.3 vs 8.5 months did not differ significantly (P = 0.271). The hazard ratio was 0.89 and the subsequent 95% CI 0.73-1.09. The median overall survival was 33.0 months for TOR and 38.7 months for TAM (P = 0.645). The hazard ratio was 0.94 with 95% CI of 0.73-1.22. The transient difference in TTP may be related to an imbalance in ER content of the tumours. When only patients with ER-positive tumours were considered (n = 238), no difference between two treatments was seen (P = 0.578). TAM was associated with an overall slightly higher frequency of adverse drug reactions than TOR (44.3 vs 39.3%) and a higher discontinuation rate due to these events (3.5% vs 0.9%). Treatment-emerged moderate dizziness (P = 0.026) and cataracts (P = 0.026) were more frequent among TAM than among TOR patients. In conclusion, TOR (60 mg day(-1)) and TAM (40 mg day(-1)) are equally effective and safe in the treatment of advanced post-menopausal ER-positive or ER-unknown breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="676"><COL><DATA> The incidence and time course of arm morbidity after sector resection and axillary dissection with or without postoperative radiotherapy to the breast was assessed in a prospective randomised trial among 381 patients with stage I breast cancer.

However, such clonal deletion has not been demonstrated in clinical studies. We have evaluated serum levels of lectin-reactive alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3), which suggests the presence of latent hepatoma cells, in a randomized controlled trial that used acyclic retinoid to prevent second primary hepatomas in patients who had received treatments that cured initial hepatomas. The trial involved 21 patients in each acyclic retinoid (600 mg daily) and placebo group and consisted of a 12-month period of drug administration and a subsequent follow-up period. Serum AFP-L3 was determined at entry and at the end of the 12-month treatment period using lectin-affinity electrophoresis and antibody-affinity blotting. Although neither treatment affected serum levels of total AFP, acyclic retinoid significantly reduced AFP-L3 levels after a 12-month administration (P &lt; 0.01). Acyclic retinoid not only deleted AFP-L3 from patients who had been positive for AFP-L3 at entry but also prevented the appearance of AFP-L3 in patients who had been negative at entry (P &lt; 0.01). In contrast, placebo significantly raised the incidence of AFP-L3-positive patients after a 12-month administration from that at entry (P &lt; 0.05). Patients positive for AFP-L3 after a 12-month treatment had a significantly higher risk of second primary hepatomas in the subsequent follow-up period (P = 0.03). Acyclic retinoid may have deleted a clone of latent hepatoma cells producing AFP-L3 and thereby inhibited second primary hepatomas. Serum AFP-L3 may be a useful intermediate biomarker in the chemoprevention of second primary hepatomas by acyclic retinoid</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="679"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether vascular inflow occlusion by the Pringle maneuver during hepatectomy can be safe and effective in reducing blood loss. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Hepatectomy can be performed with a low mortality rate, but massive hemorrhage during surgery remains a potentially lethal problem. The Pringle maneuver is traditionally used during hepatectomy to reduce blood loss, but there is a potential harmful effect on the metabolic function of hepatocytes. There has been no prospective randomized study to determine whether the Pringle maneuver can decrease blood loss during hepatectomy, improve outcome, or affect the metabolism of hepatocytes. METHODS: From July 1995 to February 1997, we studied 100 consecutive patients who underwent hepatectomy for liver tumors. The patients were randomly assigned to liver transection under intermittent Pringle maneuver of 20 minutes and a 5-minute clamp-free interval (n = 50), or liver transection without the Pringle maneuver (n = 50). The surface area of liver transection was measured and blood loss during transection per square centimeter of transection area was calculated. Routine liver biochemistry, arterial ketone body ratio (AKBR), and the indocyanine green (ICG) clearance test were done. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable in terms of preoperative liver function and in the proportion of patients having major hepatectomy. The Pringle maneuver resulted in less blood loss per square centimeter of transection area (12 mL/cm2 vs. 22 mL/cm2, p = 0.0001), a shorter transection time per square centimeter of transection area (2 min/cm2 vs. 2.8 min/cm2, p = 0.016), a significantly higher AKBR in the first 2 hours after hepatectomy, lower serum bilirubin levels in the early postoperative period, and, in cirrhotic patients, higher serum transferrin levels on postoperative days 1 and 8. The complication rate, the hospital mortality rate, and the ICG retention at 15 minutes on postoperative day 8 were equal for the two groups.CONCLUSION: Performing the Pringle maneuver during liver transection resulted in less blood loss and better preservation of liver function in the early postoperative period. This is probably because there was less hemodynamic disturbance induced by the bleeding</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="680"><COL><DATA> Intra-arterial injection of radioactive Lipiodol has shown promising results in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and portal obstruction. The aim of this prospective, randomized trial was to compare the efficacy and tolerance of 131I-labeled Lipiodol and chemoembolization for the treatment of patients with HCC. From September 1990 to September 1993, 142 patients (135 men, 7 women; age: 65 +/- 6.6 years) were randomly assigned to treatment groups and given either intra-arterial injections of 131I-labeled Lipiodol (60 mCi; 2.2 GBq) (n = 73) or chemoembolization (70 mg cisplatin) (n = 69). Subsequent injections were given at 2, 5, 8, 12, and 18 months. Tumor response was assessed on the basis of tumor size and serum alpha-fetoprotein levels. Patient tolerance was assessed clinically and angiographically. Survival rate was the main end-point. A total of 129 patients (65 in the 131I-labeled Lipiodol group and 64 in the chemoembolization group) were available for analysis; 13 were excluded, mainly because of portal vein thrombosis. The two groups were comparable. Actuarial survival curves were not significantly different between the two groups. Overall survival rates at 6 months, 1, 2, 3, and 4 years were 69%, 38%, 22%, 14%, and 10%, and 66%, 42%, 22%, 3%, and 0% in the 131I-labeled Lipiodol and chemoembolization groups, respectively. Reduction in tumor size was similar for the two groups, with complete response in 1 and 0 patients and partial response in 15 and 16 patients in the 131I-labeled Lipiodol and chemoembolization groups, respectively. Tolerance was significantly better in the 131I-labeled Lipiodol group both clinically (3 severe side effects vs. 29 in the chemoembolization group; P &lt; .001) and angiographically (1 arterial thrombosis vs. 10 in the chemoembolization group; P &lt; .01). In terms of patient survival and tumor response, radioactive 131I-labeled Lipiodol and chemoembolization were equally effective in the treatment of HCC, but tolerance to 131I-labeled Lipiodol was significantly better</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="681"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: A prospective randomized controlled study was performed to evaluate the usefulness of prophylactic endoscopic sclerotherapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma complicated by esophageal varices. METHODS: The subjects included 58 patients with esophageal varices negative for the red color sign and hepatocellular carcinoma without tumor emboli in the portal trunk or primary portal branches. Patients were randomly assigned to prophylactic sclerotherapy (n = 29) or control (n = 29) groups, and their bleeding and survival rates were compared. RESULTS: A mean of 3.0 sclerotherapy sessions was required for complete disappearance of varices in patients receiving prophylactic sclerotherapy. During the observation period, transcatheter arterial embolization for hepatocellular carcinoma was performed more often in patients with prophylactic sclerotherapy (mean 3.8 times) than in control patients (mean 2.0 times) (p &lt; .05). Percutaneous ethanol injection therapy was performed more often in patients with prophylactic sclerotherapy than in controls (mean 8.1 times vs 5.0 times, respectively) (p &lt; .05).

One report showed intra-arterial administration of epirubicin to be effective in the treatment of nonresectable HCC. We evaluated the effect of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy including this drug. Fifty-seven patients who had undergone radical resection of HCC were entered in this study. Using the sealed-envelope method, 27 patients were assigned to a group undergoing resection only and 29 patients to a group also receiving adjuvant chemotherapy after resection. The protocol of the chemotherapy was intra-arterial administration of epirubicin (40 mg/m2) at 1 month after resection followed by intravenous administration of epirubicin (40 mg/m2) every 3 months for 2 years. In addition, 1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil (HCFU; carmofur), 300 mg/d, was administered orally every day, beginning from 1 month after the resection and continuing (in principle) for 24 months. The clinicopathologic backgrounds were well randomized between the two groups. The chemotherapy protocol was performed completely in only five patients (7.2%). Twenty-four (82.8%) patients had to cease the protocol due to various reasons: change to a new therapy after recurrence of HCC in 19 cases (79.2%), severe side effects of the chemotherapy in three cases (12.5%), liver failure in one case (4.2%), and a postoperative complication in one case (4.2%). The mean total doses were 128 +/- 114 mg for epirubicin and 144 +/- 84 g for HCFU. The cumulative overall and disease-free survival rates for 5 years were not significantly different between the two groups.

One hundred ninety-two hospitals participated, and 415 patients were enrolled in the study during the period between October 1989 and December 1990. The patients were randomly allocated to group A (EPI) or group B (DOX) by a centralized telephone registration. The actual doses of EPI and DOX were 72 mg/body and 48 mg/body, respectively. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were, respectively, 69%, 44%, and 33% for group A and 73%, 54%, and 37% for group B. There were no statistically significant differences (P = .2296, log-rank test). When each group of patients was classified retrospectively into high-risk and low-risk subgroups based on the severity index calculated by the Cox regression model from the significant prognostic factors (the pretreatment tumor size, the pretreatment serum alpha-fetoprotein level, tumor encroachment, and Child&apos;s classification), the survival curve of the low-risk DOX subgroup was significantly superior to that of the low-risk EPI subgroup (P = .0182). However, there was no significant difference between the high-risk subgroups (P = .4606). The change in the serum alpha-fetoprotein level, the extent of Lipiodol accumulation in the tumor, and the extent of tumor reduction after the treatment did not show any significant differences between the groups. The white blood cell count in group B showed a tendency to decrease slightly more than in group A at 3 weeks after Lipiodol-transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized, prospective controlled study was performed in the Second Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan. Twenty-six patients who underwent a major hepatic resection were divided into 2 groups: EEN (n = 13), and TPN (n = 13). There was no significant difference between the two groups in regard to either clinical backgrounds, nutritional parameters. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the nutritional parameters after hepatectomy, such as the serum levels of retinol binding protein, transierrin, pre-albumin, and 3-methylhistidine between the two groups. Among the immunologic parameters, NK activity and changes in the lymphocyte number, the PHA response and the NK activity, which was expressed as a percentage of the preoperative values, was significantly higher in the EEN group than in the TPN group (p &lt; 0.05). The incidence of infectious complications in the TPN group was 4 of 13 patients (31%), although the same incidence in the EEN group was only 1 of 13 (8%). In one case of TPN, a bacterial strain of gut origin was isolated from the intra-abdominal abscess, which suggested that bacterial translocation occurred. CONCLUSION: No significant difference was observed in the nutritional parameters between the EEN and TPN groups.

Forty eligible patients were randomized into two groups: 20 with TAE plus 5&apos;-DFUR (400 mg/day) and 20 with TAE alone. A good necrosis rate or decrease in size of more than 70% of the original tumor mass was attained in 14 by the TAE plus 5&apos;-DFUR arm, and in 12 by the TAE arm at 3 months after the first TAE. Although all five patients with HCC and 70-99% necrosis rate after the first TAE in the TAE alone arm showed a less than 70% necrosis rate at 12 months, four of the seven patients with a 70-99% necrosis in the TAE plus 5&apos;-DFUR arm retained a necrosis of more than 70% at 12 months after the first TAE. The appearance rate of ascites and/or encephalopathy in patients with chemotherapy was not different from that of patients with TAE alone. One-year survival rates in the TAE plus 5&apos;-DFUR arm and the TAE alone arm were 75.0% and 85.0%, 2-year rates were 64.2% and 66.2%, and 3-year rates were 64.6% and 49.7%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the survival curves. In conclusion, adjuvant therapy with 5&apos;-DFUR was well tolerated without significant side effects, and it might maintain a good necrosis state of HCC after TAE.

Compression of the cirrhotic liver impairs hepatic and systemic blood circulation, which may cause liver dysfunction. We adopted a transthoracic transdiaphragmatic approach for hepatectomy of segment VII or VIII in cirrhotic patients to establish a good operative field without compressing the liver. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits of this approach. Forty-four patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicating liver cirrhosis who underwent limited hepatectomy of Couinaud&apos;s segment VII or VIII were studied. The patients were randomized to two groups preoperatively: group I (n = 22), transabdominal approach; group II (n = 22), transthoracic transdiaphragmatic approach. There were no differences in preoperative liver function tests, hepatic functional reserve, or extent of tumor between the two groups. The operative time in group II was significantly shorter than that in group I (243 +/- 50 versus 313 +/- 80 minutes;p &lt; 0.01).

METHODS: Forty-five patients with unresectable periampullary cancer complicated by gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) were recruited into this study between May 1992 and November 1995. They were randomized to receive one of the three types of gastrojejunostomy. The anastomosis in type I gastrojejunostomy was performed at the jejunum 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz. Type II was similar to type I except that in type II a duodenum partition was done by linear stapler 1 cm beyond the pylorus. Type III gastrojejunostomy was performed at the Roux-limb jejunum 60 cm distal to biliojejunostomy. RESULTS: &quot;Food reentry&quot; was noted in three (21%) of the type I patients, as determined by upper gastrointestinal (UGI) study. Of the three, one patient had severe circulus vomiting, one had anorexia, and one had no major symptoms. When patients were evaluated immediately after oral diet intake resumed, the incidence (27%) of clinical GOO symptoms and mean value of gastric emptying time (GET1/2, 118.1 +/- 39.2 min) were significantly lower in type II patients than in types I and III patients. When evaluated I month after operation, the incidence (7% and 17%, respectively) of clinical symptoms of GOO and mean value of GET1/2 (42.0 +/- 23.0 and 35.6 +/- 5.4 min, respectively) were significantly lower in both type II and type III patients than in type I patients. The type II patients resumed oral diet after operation 3.5 days earlier than type I patients, p &lt; 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Circulus vomiting induced by food reentry does exist if the gastrojejunostomy is performed as the type I gastrojejunostomy in this study.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Phase I and II trials with VMO showed minimal toxicity and clinical efficacy in patients with melanoma. In a recently completed phase III VMO trial, the first interim analysis performed in April 1994 showed an increasing trend in the survival of patients treated with VMO. The second interim analysis was performed in April 1995. METHODS: Patients with surgically resected stage II (UICC) melanoma were treated with VMO (N = 104) or placebo vaccinia vaccine virus (V) (N = 113) once a week for 13 weeks and then once every 2 weeks for a total of 12 months.

The addition of cisplatin (CDDP) has resulted in response rates greater than 50%. This study was performed to determine whether the addition of CDDP to a cytokine treatment regimen with IFN alpha and high-dose IL-2 influences survival of patients with metastatic melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced metastatic melanoma were randomly assigned to receive treatment with IFN alpha 10 x 10(6) U/m2 subcutaneously on days 1 through 5 and a high-dose intravenous decrescendo regimen of IL-2 on days 3 through 8 (18 mIU/ m2/6 hours, 18 mIU/m2/12 hours, 18 mIU/m2/24 hours, and 4.5 mIU/m2/24 hours x 3) without (arm A) or with (arm B) CDDP 100 mg/m2 on day 1. Treatment cycles were repeated every 28 days to a maximum of four cycles. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-eight patients with advanced metastatic melanoma, of whom 87% had visceral metastases, were accrued for the trial. Both regimens were feasible in a multicenter setting. The objective response rate was 18% without and 33% with CDDP (P = .04). The progression-free survival was 53 days without and 92 days with CDDP (P = .02, Wilcoxon; P = .09, log-rank). There was no statistically significant difference in survival between treatment arms, with a median overall survival duration for all patients of 9 months.

Forty-two patients were randomly assigned to receive systemic high-dose IL-2 with standard supportive measures (group A = 21 patients) or with the addition of prophylactic dopamine (group B = 21 patients) at 2 mg/kg/min. For patients in group B, dopamine was instituted 1 h before the initiation of IL-2 administration and was discontinued 6-12 h after the maximum number of doses of IL-2 were given. There was no difference in the amount of IL-2 administered for each course of therapy for groups A and B. Despite differences in urine flow (milliliters per kilogram per day), fluid balance (liters per day), and overall weight gain, prophylactic low-dose dopamine did not significantly alter maximum plasma urea or creatinine levels in group B when compared with the control group (group A). The overall toxicity profile considering all grade 3 and 4 toxicities for patients in groups A and B was comparable. Thus, there is no evidence to support the routine use of prophylactic low-dose dopamine in patients receiving high-dose IL-2</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="812"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed to compare the toxicity and biologic effects of treatment with high-dose intravenous (IV) bolus interleukin-2 (IL-2) plus the recombinant human soluble p75 tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor immunoglobulin G (IgG) chimera (rhuTNFR:Fc) with high-dose IL-2 alone in patients with advanced melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with advanced melanoma or renal cell carcinoma were randomized to receive IL-2 (Chiron, Emeryville, CA) 600,000 IU/kg every 8 hours on days 1 to 5 and 15 to 19 (maximum, 28 doses) combined with placebo or the rhuTNFR:Fc fusion protein (Immunex, Seattle, WA) 10 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15 and 5 mg/m2 on days 3, 5, 17, and 19. The impact of rhuTNFR:Fc on IL-2 toxicity and biologic effects was evaluated. RESULTS: No clinically significant difference in toxicity was observed in the two treatment arms. The adjusted median number of IL-2 doses administered during cycle 1 was 24.5 (range, seven to 28) and 21.5 (range, five to 27) for the placebo and rhuTNFR:Fc arms, respectively (P = .544). IL-2-induced TNF bioactivity, neutrophil chemotactic defect, and serum IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) induction were suppressed by rhuTNFR:Fc. Two of nine assessable patients (22%) on IL-2/placebo and three of 10 patients (30%) on IL-2/rhuTNFR:Fc responded. CONCLUSION: Despite evidence of in vitro neutralization of TNF functional activity and partial inhibition of other secondary biologic effects of IL-2, rhuTNFR:Fc does not reduce the clinical toxicity associated with high-dose IL-2 therapy. These results suggest that the toxicity and antitumor effects of IL-2 treatment are independent of circulating TNF</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="924"><COL><DATA> A randomized controlled trial of prophylactic isolated hyperthermic limb perfusion (IHLP) using melphalan at 2 mg/kg body weight has been performed on a total of 30 patients with primary melanoma of the lower limb &gt; or = 1.7 mm thick.

Cure rates with surgery and radiotherapy are high, but these treatments have never been compared prospectively. A randomized trial was initiated in 1982 to compare surgery and radiotherapy in the treatment of primary BCC of the face measuring less than 4 cm. The primary end point was the failure rate (persistent or recurrent disease) after 4 years of follow-up. The secondary end point was the cosmetic results assessed by the patient, the dermatologist and three persons not involved in the trial. In the course of the trial, 347 patients were treated. Of the 174 patients in the surgery group, 71% had local anaesthesia and 91% frozen section examination. Of the 173 patients in the radiotherapy group, 55% were treated with interstitial brachytherapy, 33% with contactherapy and 12% with conventional radiotherapy. The 4-year actuarial failure rate (95% CI) was 0.7% (0.1-3.9%) in the surgery group compared with 7.5% (4.2-13.1%) in the radiotherapy group (log-rank P = 0.003). The cosmetic results assessed by four of the five judges were significantly better after surgery than after radiotherapy. Eighty-seven per cent of the surgery-treated patients and 69% of the radiation-treated patients considered the cosmetic result as good (P &lt; 0.01). Thus, in the treatment of BCC of the face of less than 4 cm in diameter, surgery should be preferred to radiotherapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="967"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: The extent to which chemotherapy may relieve tumour-related symptoms, improve quality of life and prolong survival in patients with gastric cancer is not known in spite of the extensive use of this treatment modality. The aim of this study was to estimate any gain in the quantity and quality of life produced by chemotherapy in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1991 and February 1995, 61 patients with gastric cancer were randomized to either chemotherapy in addition to best supportive care or to best supportive care. Chemotherapy was allowed in the latter group if the supportive measures did not lead to palliation. Chemotherapy was the ELF-regimen consisting of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and etoposide, or, in elderly patients with poor performance, a 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin regimen (FLv). Quality of life was evaluated with the EORTC-QLQ-C30 instrument. RESULTS: More patients in the chemotherapy group (45%, 14/31) had an improved or prolonged high quality of life for a minimum period of 4 months compared to those in the best supportive care group (20%, 6/30, P &lt; 0.05). A similar difference was seen in the treating physician&apos;s evaluation of whether the patient was subjectively improved or continued to do well for at least 4 months (17/31, 55% versus 6/30, 20%, P &lt; 0.01). Overall survival was longer in the chemotherapy group (median 8 vs. 5 months) although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.12). After corrections for imbalances in pretreatment characteristics, chemotherapy treatment was, however, associated with a survival benefit (P = 0.003). Also, the quality-adjusted survival time and time to disease progression were longer for patients randomized to chemotherapy (median 5 vs. 2 months, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that chemotherapy can add to both quantity and quality of life in advanced gastric cancer. The number of patients who benefit from treatment is, however, still rather limited</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="968"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: We report the results of a prospectively randomized study that compared the combination of epirubicin, cisplatin, and protracted venous infusion fluorouracil (5-FU) (ECF regimen) with the standard combination of 5-FU, doxorubicin, and methotrexate (FAMTX) in previously untreated patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred seventy-four patients with adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma were randomized and analyzed for survival, tumor response, toxicity, and quality of life (QL). RESULTS: The overall response rate was 45% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36% to 54%) with ECF and 21% (95% CI, 13% to 29%) with FAMTX (P = .0002). Toxicity was tolerable and there were only three toxic deaths. The FAMTX regimen caused more hematologic toxicity and serious infections, but ECF caused more emesis and alopecia. The median survival duration was 8.9 months with ECF and 5.7 months with FAMTX (P = .0009); at 1 year, 36% (95% CI, 27% to 45%) of ECF and 21% (95% CI, 14% to 29%) of FAMTX patients were alive. The median failure-free survival duration was 7.4 months with ECF and 3.4 months with FAMTX (P = .00006). The global QL scores were better for ECF at 24 weeks, but the remaining QL data showed no differences between either arm of the study. Hospital-based cost analysis on a subset of patients was similar for each arm and translated into an increment cost of $975 per life-year gained. CONCLUSION: The ECF regimen results in a survival and response advantage, tolerable toxicity, better QL and cost-effectiveness compared with FAMTX chemotherapy. This regimen should now be considered the standard treatment for advanced esophagogastric cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1026"><COL><DATA> The incidence and time course of arm morbidity after sector resection and axillary dissection with or without postoperative radiotherapy to the breast was assessed in a prospective randomised trial among 381 patients with stage I breast cancer.

Postoperative wound complications increased the incidence of arm symptoms at 3-12 months from 104/283 to 39/79 at 3-12 months (P = 0.03). Employed patients and patients &lt; 65 years of age reported arm symptoms at 3-12 months in 86/161 and 94/191 compared to 58/207 and 50/177 among retired patients and patients &gt; or = 65 years of age, respectively (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0002, respectively). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis at 3-12 months, only young age (relative risk = 0.93 per year of increasing age, 95% CI 0.91-0.97) and the number of lymph nodes found in the axillary specimen (relative risk = 1.11 per lymph node found, 95% CI 1.05-1.18) remained statistically significant. No negative impact on arm morbidity was found by the addition of postoperative radiotherapy only to the breast, either in univariate or multivariate models. We conclude that factors directly related to the extent of the surgical procedure and young age are determinants of arm morbidity after breast preserving treatment for stage I breast cancer. Arm symptoms are most common during the first year after treatment and are reduced over the subsequent 2-3 years by around 40-50%</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1032"><COL><DATA> The study was planned to compare, in a prospective double-blind randomized trial, the efficacy and safety of toremifene (TOR) and tamoxifen (TAM) in post-menopausal patients with advanced breast cancer who have not had prior systemic therapy for advanced disease. Four hundred and fifteen post-menopausal patients with oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive or ER-unknown advanced breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive daily either 60 mg TOR or 40 mg TAM. The patients were stratified to measurable and non-measurable but evaluable groups. They were assessed for response to therapy, time to progression (TTP), time to treatment failure (TTF), response duration, overall survival and drug toxicity. Two hundred and fourteen patients were randomized into TOR and 201 into TAM treatment. The response rate (complete + partial) was 31.3% for TOR and 37.3% for TAM (P = 0.215). The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the 6% difference was -15.1% to 3.1%. The median TTP was 7.3 months for TOR and 10.2 months for TAM (P = 0.047). The 95% CI for the hazard ratio of 0.80 was 0.64-1.00. A percentage of the TOR patients (9.8%) and the TAM patients (18.9%) discontinued the treatment prematurely (P = 0.011) for various reasons. Consequently, the median TTF of 6.3 vs 8.5 months did not differ significantly (P = 0.271). The hazard ratio was 0.89 and the subsequent 95% CI 0.73-1.09. The median overall survival was 33.0 months for TOR and 38.7 months for TAM (P = 0.645). The hazard ratio was 0.94 with 95% CI of 0.73-1.22. The transient difference in TTP may be related to an imbalance in ER content of the tumours. When only patients with ER-positive tumours were considered (n = 238), no difference between two treatments was seen (P = 0.578). TAM was associated with an overall slightly higher frequency of adverse drug reactions than TOR (44.3 vs 39.3%) and a higher discontinuation rate due to these events (3.5% vs 0.9%). Treatment-emerged moderate dizziness (P = 0.026) and cataracts (P = 0.026) were more frequent among TAM than among TOR patients. In conclusion, TOR (60 mg day(-1)) and TAM (40 mg day(-1)) are equally effective and safe in the treatment of advanced post-menopausal ER-positive or ER-unknown breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1034"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To determine the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane (DZR) used in a doxorubicin-based combination therapy in advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between November 1988 and January 1991, 534 patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to two multicenter, double-blind studies (088001 and 088006). Patients received fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) with either DZR (DZR-to-doxorubicin ratio, 10:1) or placebo (PLA) every 3 weeks and were monitored with serial multiplegated acquisition (MUGA) scans. RESULTS: The hazards ratio (HR) of PLA to DZR for a cardiac event, which was predefined ejection fraction changes or congestive heart failure (CHF), was 2.63 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.61 to 4.27; P &lt; .001) for 088001 and 2.00 (95% CI, 1.01 to 3.96; P = .038) for 088006. The objective response rates for 088001 were 46.8% for DZR and 60.5% for PLA, a difference of 14% (95% CI, -25% to -2%; P = .019), and for 088006 were 53.7% for DZR and 49.3% for PLA, a difference of 4% (95% CI, -13% to 22%; P = .63). Time to progression and survival were not significantly different between treatment arms in either study. Toxicities on the DZR arms included lower granulocyte and platelet counts at nadir (P = .009 and P = .004, respectively) and more pain on injection (P = .001), with no difference in the rates of fever, infection, or hemorrhage. CONCLUSION: DZR had a significant cardioprotective effect as measured by noninvasive testing and clinical CHF. One of the two studies (088001) showed a lower response rate with DZR, but time to progression and survival were not significantly different. DZR is the first agent shown to reduce cardiotoxicity from doxorubicin</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1039"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: The effect of a cyclic versus a continuous enteral feeding protocol on postoperative delayed gastric emptying, start of normal diet, and hospital stay was assessed in patients undergoing pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Delayed gastric emptying occurs in approximately 30% of patients after PPPD and causes prolonged hospital stay. Enteral nutrition through a catheter jejunostomy is used to provide postoperative nutritional support. Enteral infusion of fats and proteins activates neurohumoral feedback mechanisms and therefore can potentially impair gastric emptying and prolong postoperative gastroparesis. METHODS: From September 1995 to December 1996, 72 consecutive patients underwent PPPD at the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam. Fifty-seven patients were included and randomized for either continuous (CON) jejunal nutrition (0-24 hr; 1500 kCal/24 hr) or cyclic (CYC) enteral nutrition (6-24 hr; 1125 kCal/18 hr). Both groups had an equal caloric load of 1 kCal/min. The following parameters were assessed: days of nasogastric intubation, days of enteral nutrition, days until normal diet was tolerated orally, and hospital stay. On postoperative day 10, plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) levels were measured during both feeding protocols. RESULTS: Nasogastric intubation was 9.1 days in the CON group (n = 30) and 6.7 days in the CYC group (n = 27) (not statistically significant). First day of normal diet was earlier for the CYC group (15.7 vs. 12.2 days, p &lt; 0.05). Hospital stay was shorter in the CYC group (21.4 vs. 17.5 days, p &lt; 0.05). CCK levels were lower in CYC patients, before and after feeding, compared with CON patients (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Cyclic enteral feeding after PPPD is associated with a shorter period of enteral nutrition, a faster return to a normal diet, and a shorter hospital stay. Continuously high CCK levels could be a cause of prolonged time until normal diet is tolerated in patients on continuous enteral nutrition. Cyclic enteral nutrition is therefore the feeding regimen of choice in patients after PPPD</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1040"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to determine whether early postoperative enteral feeding with an immune-enhancing formula (IEF) decreases morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital stay in patients with upper gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Early enteral feeding with an IEF has been associated with improved outcome in trauma and critical care patients. Evaluable data documenting reduced complications after major upper GI surgery for malignancy with early enteral feeding are limited. METHODS: Between March 1994 and August 1996, 195 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of esophageal (n = 23), gastric (n = 75), peripancreatic (n = 86), or bile duct (n = 11) cancer underwent resection and were randomized to IEF via jejunostomy tube or control (CNTL). Tube feedings were supplemented with arginine, RNA, and omega-3 fatty acids, begun on postoperative 1, and advanced to a goal of 25 kcal/kg per day. The CNTL involved intravenous crystalloid solutions. Statistical analysis was by t test, chi square, or logistic regression. RESULTS: Patient demographics, nutritional status, and operative factors were similar between the groups. Caloric intake was 61% and 22% of goal for the IEF and CNTL groups, respectively. The IEF group received significantly more protein, carbohydrate, lipids and immune-enhancing nutrients than did the CNTL group. There were no significant differences in the number of minor, major, or infectious wound complications between the groups. There was one bowel necrosis associated with IEF requiring reoperation. Hospital mortality was 2.5% and median length of hospital stay was 11 days, which was not different between the groups.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Three multicenter, prospective, randomized trials concluded that patients who receive octreotide during and after pancreatic resection have a reduction in the total number of complications or a decreased incidence of pancreatic fistula. However, in the subset of patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for malignancy, either no analysis was performed or no benefit from octreotide could be demonstrated. METHODS: A single-institution, prospective, randomized trial was conducted between June 1991 and December 1995 involving 120 patients who were randomized to receive octreotide (150 microg subcutaneously every 8 hours through postoperative day 5) or no further treatment after pancreaticoduodenectomy for malignancy. The surgical technique was standardized, and the pancreaticojejunal anastomosis was created using the duct-to-mucosa or invagination technique. RESULTS: The two patient groups were similar with respect to patient demographics, treatment variables, and histologic diagnoses. The rate of clinically significant pancreatic leak was 12% in the octreotide group and 6% in the control group (p = 0.23). Perioperative morbidity was 30% and 25%, respectively. Patients who underwent reoperative pancreaticoduodenectomy had an increased incidence of pancreatic anastomotic leak, whereas those who received preoperative chemoradiation had a decreased incidence of pancreatic anastomotic leak.

METHODS: From 1978 through 1986, 318 premenopausal women with node-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned, after modified radical mastectomy, to receive chemotherapy plus radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone. Radiotherapy was given to the chest wall and locoregional lymph nodes between the fourth and fifth cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. RESULTS: After 15 years of follow-up, the women assigned to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy had a 33 percent reduction in the rate of recurrence (relative risk, 0.67; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.50 to 0.90) and a 29 percent reduction in mortality from breast cancer (relative risk, 0.71; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.99), as compared with the women treated with chemotherapy alone.

In a Phase III trial, the efficacy and tolerability of anastrozole, given in doses of 1 and 10 mg orally once daily, and megestrol acetate, given in doses of 40 mg orally 4 times daily, were compared in 386 postmenopausal women with advanced breast carcinoma who progressed after tamoxifen therapy. METHODS: The trial was randomized, double blind for anastrozole, open label for megestrol acetate, parallel group, and multicenter. Patients were randomly assigned to receive anastrozole, 1 mg (n = 128); anastrozole, 10 mg (n = 130); or megestrol acetate (n = 128). The primary efficacy measures were time to progression and tumor response; secondary measures were time to treatment failure, duration of response, quality of life, and time to death. RESULTS: With a median duration of follow-up of 6 months, there was no statistical evidence of a difference between either 1 or 10 mg doses of anastrozole and megestrol acetate for any efficacy endpoint. According to rigid response criteria, 10%, 6%, and 6% of patients in the anastrozole 1 mg, anastrozole 10 mg, and megestrol acetate groups, respectively, had an objective response (complete response or partial response) and 27%, 24%, and 30% of patients in the respective groups had stable disease for a duration of 24 weeks or longer. Quality-of-life assessments revealed that anastrozole in a 1-mg dose was associated with better physical scores and anastrozole in a 10-mg dose with better psychologic scores than megestrol acetate. Both anastrozole and megestrol acetate were generally well tolerated. Among anticipated adverse events, gastrointestinal disturbance was more common among patients in the anastrozole groups, whereas weight gain occurred more frequently among patients in the megestrol acetate groups. Weight increases of 5% or more and 10% or more were more common among megestrol acetate-treated patients; moreover, patients in this group continued to gain weight over time.

MATERIAL: Two hundred five unselected stage Ib patients (having tumors &gt; 2 cm in diameter) were divided into two groups at random: (1) The group control consisted of 103 patients (56 bulky, &gt; 4 cm diameter) treated with Wertheim-Meigs (if the tumor was resectable with free surgical margins) + adjuvant radiotherapy to whole pelvis (extended field radiation was used only in patients with paraaortic lymph node metastases). When the tumor was unresectable, a surgical staging was performed and radiotherapy was the chosen treatment. (2) Neoadjuvant (102 patients, 61 bulky) had neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then the same treatment as the control patients. RESULTS: After 67 (31-102) months of follow-up, no difference was seen in tumors &gt; 2 and &lt; 4 cm in both groups (C = 77% vs N = 82%), but statistically significant differences were seen in survival and disease-free survival, in bulky tumors, and between patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy + Wertheim-Meigs + radiotherapy (80%) and the control (61%). This was due to an increased operability that was substantially improved in bulky tumors in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group (61/61, 100%) vs control (48/56, 85%; P &lt; 0.01). After 7 years of follow-up, the outcome of the unresectable bulky control group of patients is significantly worse (14%) than that of the resectable group (69%; P &lt; 0.001). With regard to recurrences, a significant decrease in pelvic failures in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group was observed (P &lt; 0.001). Survival was improved in bulky resectable cases (N = 81% vs C = 69%, P &lt; 0.05). Pathological findings for the surgical specimens revealed differences between both groups because all the risk factors such as parametrial and lymph node metastases, tumor bulk, and vascular embolism had been decreased (P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can improve survival because of increased operability with free survival margins and a decrease in pathologic risk factors in unselected, bulky (&gt; 4 cm diameter) stage Ib patients</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1117"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Stage Ib and IIa cervical carcinoma can be cured by radical surgery or radiotherapy. These two procedures are equally effective, but differ in associated morbidity and type of complications. In this prospective randomised trial of radiotherapy versus surgery, our aim was to assess the 5-year survival and the rate and pattern of complications and recurrences associated with each treatment. METHODS: Between September, 1986, and December, 1991, 469 women with newly diagnosed stage Ib and IIa cervical carcinoma were referred to our institute. 343 eligible patients were randomised: 172 to surgery and 171 to radical radiotherapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy was delivered after surgery for women with surgical stage pT2b or greater, less than 3 mm of safe cervical stroma, cut-through, or positive nodes. The primary outcome measures were 5-year survival and the rate of complications. The analysis of survival and recurrence was by intention to treat and analysis of complications was by treatment delivered. FINDINGS: 170 patients in the surgery group and 167 in the radiotherapy group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis; scheduled treatment was delivered to 169 and 158 women, respectively, 62 of 114 women with cervical diameters of 4 cm or smaller and 46 of 55 with diameters larger than 4 cm received adjuvant therapy. After a median follow-up of 87 (range 57-120) months, 5-year overall and disease-free survival were identical in the surgery and radiotherapy groups (83% and 74%, respectively, for both groups), 86 women developed recurrent disease: 42 (25%) in the surgery group and 44 (26%) in the radiotherapy group. Significant factors for survival in univariate and multivariate analyses were: cervical diameter, positive lymphangiography, and adeno-carcinomatous histotype. 48 (28%) surgery-group patients had severe morbidity compared with 19 (12%) radiotherapy-group patients (p = 0.0004). INTERPRETATION: There is no treatment of choice for early-stage cervical carcinoma in terms of overall or disease-free survival. The combination of surgery and radiotherapy has the worst morbidity, especially urological complications. The optimum therapy for each patient should take account of clinical factors such as menopausal status, age, medical illness, histological type, and cervical diameter to yield the best cure with minimum complications</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1118"><COL><DATA> The purpose of our study was to determine whether the chemoradiation is better than radiotherapy alone with respect to survival and treatment toxicity in patients with advanced carcinoma of the cervix.

The patients in the concurrent group received cisplatin, vincristine, and bleomycin every 3 weeks for a total of four courses, in combination with radiotherapy concurrently. Sixty patients were randomized to the concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and 62 were randomized to the radiotherapy alone. A tumor response was observed in 88.3% of the patients in concurrent group and in 74.2% of the patients in radiotherapy group (P = 0.04).

Treatment-related toxicity appears to be higher with the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone (36.7% versus 17.7%, P = 0.02). However, analysis by Kaplan-Meier method showed that the actuarial survival was not statistically different between the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups (mean survival time: 38.1 months versus 41.5 months, P = 0.27).

Combinations of cisplatin plus ifosfamide and cisplatin plus mitolactol are prospectively compared with cisplatin alone. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive cisplatin 50 mg/m2 or the same dose of cisplatin plus mitolactol (C + M) 180 mg/m2 orally on days 2 to 6, or cisplatin plus ifosfamide (CIFX) 5 g/m2 given as a 24-hour infusion plus mesna 6 g/m2 during and for 12 hours after the ifosfamide infusion, every 3 weeks for up to six courses. Of 454 patients entered, 438 were eligible and analyzed for response and survival. RESULTS: CIFX had a higher response rate (31.1% v 17.8%, p = .004) and longer progression-free survival (PFS) time (P = .003) compared with cisplatin alone. The median times to progression or death were 4.6 and 3.2 months, respectively. C + M showed no significant improvement in these parameters compared with cisplatin alone. Survival was associated with initial performance score (PS; 0 was more favorable; P &lt; .001) and with age (younger was unfavorable, P = .025). There was no significant difference in overall survival between cisplatin and either of the combinations. Leukopenia, renal toxicity, peripheral neurotoxicity, and CNS toxicity were more frequent with CIFX (P &lt; .05). CONCLUSION: CIFX improved the response rate and PFS duration in advanced cervix cancer compared with cisplatin alone, but at the cost of greater toxicity and with no improvement in survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1152"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Irradiation after mastectomy can reduce locoregional recurrences in women with breast cancer, but whether it prolongs survival remains controversial. We conducted a randomized trial of radiotherapy after mastectomy in high-risk premenopausal women, all of whom also received adjuvant systemic chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF). METHODS: A total of 1708 women who had undergone mastectomy for pathological stage II or III breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive eight cycles of CMF plus irradiation of the chest wall and regional lymph nodes (852 women) or nine cycles of CMF alone (856 women). The median length of follow-up was 114 months. The end points were locoregional recurrence, distant metastases, disease-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: The frequency of locoregional recurrence alone or with distant metastases was 9 percent among the women who received radiotherapy plus CMF and 32 percent among those who received CMF alone (P&lt;0.001). The probability of survival free of disease after 10 years was 48 percent among the women assigned to radiotherapy plus CMF and 34 percent among those treated only with CMF (P&lt;0.001). Overall survival at 10 years was 54 percent among those given radiotherapy and CMF and 45 percent among those who received CMF alone (P&lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that irradiation after mastectomy significantly improved disease-free survival and overall survival, irrespective of tumor size, the number of positive nodes, or the histopathological grade. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of postoperative irradiation to mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy reduces locoregional recurrences and prolongs survival in high-risk premenopausal women with breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1167"><COL><DATA> Breast Neoplasms/Carcinoma in Situ/Carcinoma,Infiltrating Duct/Combined Modality Therapy/Diagnosis,Differential/Dyes/Female/Human/Microtomy/Neoplasm Recurrence,Local/Neoplasm Staging/Neoplasm,Residual/pathology/Radiotherapy/surgery/United States</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1176"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To determine whether perioperative polychemotherapy (PeCT) can significantly prolong the overall survival of women with early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: A meta-analysis that used updated individual patient data from all available randomized trials of PeCT, both published and unpublished, was conducted. Data on 6,093 patients (1,124 deaths and 1,912 recurrences) from five clinical trials were available (median follow-up duration, 5.3 years; maximum, 11.3 years). RESULTS: No significant effect of PeCT on overall survival was observed. However, patients who received PeCT had a significantly longer disease- free survival (hazards ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 0.98; P = .02). Time to local recurrence was significantly prolonged in the PeCT arm (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.80; P &lt; .0001). Likewise, there was a borderline significant difference in favor of PeCT in terms of time to distant metastases (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.00; P = .05). Subgroup analyses suggest that node-negative women benefited the most from treatment. CONCLUSION: At present, there is no evidence that PeCT is able to prolong overall survival in patients with early-stage breast cancer; however, further follow-up evaluation is required. PeCT significantly prolongs disease-free survival, especially in node-negative women, which emphasizes once more the need for clinical trials in this subgroup</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1198"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Most patients with advanced pancreas cancer experience pain and must limit their daily activities because of tumor-related symptoms. To date, no treatment has had a significant impact on the disease. In early studies with gemcitabine, patients with pancreas cancer experienced an improvement in disease-related symptoms. Based on those findings, a definitive trial was performed to assess the effectiveness of gemcitabine in patients with newly diagnosed advanced pancreas cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-six patients with advanced symptomatic pancreas cancer completed a lead-in period to characterize and stabilize pain and were randomized to receive either gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 weekly x 7 followed by 1 week of rest, then weekly x 3 every 4 weeks thereafter (63 patients), or to fluorouracil (5-FU) 600 mg/m2 once weekly (63 patients). The primary efficacy measure was clinical benefit response, which was a composite of measurements of pain (analgesic consumption and pain intensity), Karnofsky performance status, and weight. Clinical benefit required a sustained (&gt; or = 4 weeks) improvement in at least one parameter without worsening in any others. Other measures of efficacy included response rate, time to progressive disease, and survival. RESULTS: Clinical benefit response was experienced by 23.8% of gemcitabine-treated patients compared with 4.8% of 5-FU-treated patients (P = .0022). The median survival durations were 5.65 and 4.41 months for gemcitabine-treated and 5-FU-treated patients, respectively (P = .0025). The survival rate at 12 months was 18% for gemcitabine patients and 2% for 5-FU patients. Treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that gemcitabine is more effective than 5-FU in alleviation of some disease-related symptoms in patients with advanced, symptomatic pancreas cancer. Gemcitabine also confers a modest survival advantage over treatment with 5-FU</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="13"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates are effective against the increased bone resorption caused by certain diseases because they inhibit the activity of osteoclasts. In patients who have breast cancer and metastatic bone disease, the bisphosphonate clodronate (clodronic acid) reduces the frequency of skeletal complications. Experiments in animals and preliminary clinical observations indicate that early clodronate therapy reduces the incidence of new bony metastases in breast cancer. We investigated the effects of clodronate on the incidence and extent of new metastases in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: Between 1990 and 1995, 302 patients with primary breast cancer and tumor cells in the bone marrow (the presence of which is a risk factor for the development of distant metastases) were randomly assigned to receive clodronate at a dose of 1600 mg per day orally for two years (157 patients) or standard follow-up (145 patients). The median length of observation was 36 months. All patients in both groups received standard surgical treatment and customary hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. RESULTS: Distant metastases were detected in 21 patients in the clodronate group and in 42 patients in the control group (P&lt;0.001). The incidence of both osseous and visceral metastases was significantly lower in the clodronate group than in the control group (P=0.003 for both osseous and visceral metastases). Six patients in the clodronate group died, as did 22 in the control group (P=0.001). The mean number of bony metastases per patient in the clodronate group was roughly half that in the control group (3.1 vs. 6.3). CONCLUSIONS: Clodronate can reduce the incidence and number of new bony and visceral metastases in women with breast cancer who are at high risk for distant metastases</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="80"><COL><DATA> A prospective randomized trial was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of fibrin glue in preventing lymphorrhea after axillary lymphadenectomy in breast cancer. One hundred and eight breast cancer patients, operated on by two senior surgeons, were randomized into two groups: group 1 (n = 58) without fibrin glue and group 2 (n = 50) with 2 ml of fibrin glue applied to the axillary dissection area at the end of the lymphadenectomy procedure. Early postoperative morbidity was 2/58 and 0/50 in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Mean daily postoperative drainage was significantly greater in group 1. The mean cumulative drainage quantity 6 days after the operation was 407.8 ml and 214.4 ml in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.001). The mean postoperative hospital stay was 10.1 days and 8.0 days in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.006). One delayed seroma was observed in each group. Fibrin glue seems to reduce daily postoperative drainage and hospital stay, but did not affect delayed seroma formation after axillary lymphadenectomy for breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="81"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: A prospective randomised trial was undertaken to evaluate the role of neoadjuvant chemoendocrine therapy prior to surgery in primary operable breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred nine women (median age 56 years, range 27-70) with primary operable breast cancer confirmed on fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology were recruited to this study. They were treated with a combination of mitozantrone and methotrexate (+/- mitomycin-C) combined with tamoxifen (2MT). Patients received eight cycles of 2MT (four prior to surgery in the neoadjuvant group) and tamoxifen for five years with appropriate surgery and radiotherapy. The two groups were comparable for age, menopausal status, stage and surgical requirements. RESULTS: The clinical response rates to neoadjuvant therapy were as follows: 22% complete response (CR), 29% minimal residual disease (MRD), 33% partial response (PR), 15% no change (NC) and only two patients had clinical evidence of progressive disease. Surgical requirements were reduced from 31 patients (22%) of the adjuvant group having mastectomy to 14 (10%) in the neoadjuvant group (P &lt; 0.003). At a median follow-up of 48 months (range 10-70 months) there is no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of local relapse, metastatic relapse or overall survival. Symptomatic and haematologic acute toxicity was low and similar for adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients in the single-agent arm (n = 153) received weekly epirubicin (E) 20 mg/m2 until progression or until the cumulative dose of 1,000 mg/m2, followed by mitomycin (M) 8 mg/m2 every 4 weeks, and those in the combination chemotherapy arm (n = 150) were first given cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, E 60 mg/m2, and fluorouracil 500 mg/m2 three times per week (CEF) followed by M 8 mg/m2 plus vinblastine (V) 6 mg/m2 every 4 weeks. Exclusion criteria included age greater than 70 years, World Health Organization (WHO) performance status greater than 2, prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease, and presence of liver metastases in patients younger than 50. RESULTS: An objective response (complete [CR] or partial [PR]) was obtained in 55%, 48%, 16%, and 7% of patients treated with CEF, E, M, and MV, respectively. A response to CEF tended to last longer than a response to E (median, 12 v 10.5 months; P = .07). Treatment-related toxicity was less in the single-agent arm and quality-of-life (QOL) analysis favored the single-agent arm. No significant difference in time to progression or survival was found between the two arms. Similarly, no difference in survival was found when the patients who received both the planned first-and second-line treatments were compared or when survival was calculated from the beginning of the second-line therapy. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with single-agent E followed by single-agent M had similar survival, but less treatment-related toxicity and better QOL as compared with those treated with CEF followed by MV</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="83"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Complications of axillary surgery occur due to severance of the intercostobrachial nerve (ICBN). The feasibility and benefit of preserving the ICBN to prevent sensory loss was studied prospectively. METHODS: Sensory symptoms and deficits were documented, and shoulder movement and arm circumference were measured at discharge and 3 months later in 120 patients randomized to either preservation or division of the ICBN. RESULT: Preserving the ICBN was feasible in 39 (65 per cent) of the 60 patients randomized to the preservation group. Preserving the nerve prolonged the procedure by a median of 5 min. No difference in sensory symptoms between the groups was seen at 3 months. At 3 months 53 per cent of patients randomized to ICBN preservation had a sensory deficit compared with 84 per cent of those randomized to ICBN sacrifice (P &lt; or = 0.05).

Tamoxifen (TAM) 20 mg/day was administered orally for 2 years after mastectomy as an adjuvant endocrine therapy in postmenopausal patients. In premenopausal patients, oophorectomy (OVEX) was performed before TAM administration. In the chemotherapy arm (CHEM), patients were given 0.06 mg/kg of body weight of mitomycin C (MMC) intravenously, followed by an oral administration of cyclophosphamide (CPA) 100 mg/day in an administration of a 3-month period and a 3-month intermission. This 6-month schedule was repeated 4 times in 2 years. The chemoendocrine arm (CHEM + TAM) was composed of TAM with MMC + CPA chemotherapy. The patients were randomized according to ER and menopausal status. ER-positive patients were randomized to three arms: OVEX +/- TAM, CHEM, and CHEM + TAM. For ER-negative patients there were two arms: CHEM and CHEM + TAM. 1579 patients entered the trial between September 1978 and December 1991, with median follow-up of 8.2 years. In ER-positive, premenopausal patients, there were no significant differences in RFS or OS among OVEX + TAM, MMC + CPA, TAM + MMC + CPA arms. On the contrary, in ER-positive, postmenopausal patients, the chemoendocrine therapy showed a significantly higher RFS (p = 0.0400) and OS (p = 0.0187) as compared with TAM to chemotherapy alone. There were no significant differences in RFS or OS by addition of TAM on the chemotherapy, in both pre- and post-menopausal ER-negative patients. It was concluded that in ER-positive premenopausal breast cancer, endocrine therapy alone may be equivalent in prolonging RFS and OS to chemotherapy or chemoendocrine therapy, and that ER-positive postmenopausal breast cancer may be better controlled with the combination of TAM and chemotherapy, as compared to TAM or chemotherapy alone. The importance of stratification of operable breast cancer by ER and menopausal status, as well as the direct comparisons of different treatments, were stressed</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="85"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: The finding of a decrease in contralateral breast cancer incidence following tamoxifen administration for adjuvant therapy led to the concept that the drug might play a role in breast cancer prevention. To test this hypothesis, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project initiated the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (P-1) in 1992. METHODS: Women (N=13388) at increased risk for breast cancer because they 1) were 60 years of age or older, 2) were 35-59 years of age with a 5-year predicted risk for breast cancer of at least 1.66%, or 3) had a history of lobular carcinoma in situ were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=6707) or 20 mg/day tamoxifen (n=6681) for 5 years. Gail&apos;s algorithm, based on a multivariate logistic regression model using combinations of risk factors, was used to estimate the probability (risk) of occurrence of breast cancer over time. RESULTS: Tamoxifen reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by 49% (two-sided P&lt;.00001), with cumulative incidence through 69 months of follow-up of 43.4 versus 22.0 per 1000 women in the placebo and tamoxifen groups, respectively. The decreased risk occurred in women aged 49 years or younger (44%), 50-59 years (51%), and 60 years or older (55%); risk was also reduced in women with a history of lobular carcinoma in situ (56%) or atypical hyperplasia (86%) and in those with any category of predicted 5-year risk. Tamoxifen reduced the risk of noninvasive breast cancer by 50% (two-sided P&lt;.002). Tamoxifen reduced the occurrence of estrogen receptor-positive tumors by 69%, but no difference in the occurrence of estrogen receptor-negative tumors was seen. Tamoxifen administration did not alter the average annual rate of ischemic heart disease; however, a reduction in hip, radius (Colles&apos;), and spine fractures was observed. The rate of endometrial cancer was increased in the tamoxifen group (risk ratio = 2.53; 95% confidence interval = 1.35-4.97); this increased risk occurred predominantly in women aged 50 years or older. All endometrial cancers in the tamoxifen group were stage I (localized disease); no endometrial cancer deaths have occurred in this group. No liver cancers or increase in colon, rectal, ovarian, or other tumors was observed in the tamoxifen group. The rates of stroke, pulmonary embolism, and deep-vein thrombosis were elevated in the tamoxifen group; these events occurred more frequently in women aged 50 years or older. CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen decreases the incidence of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer. Despite side effects resulting from administration of tamoxifen, its use as a breast cancer preventive agent is appropriate in many women at increased risk for the disease</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="86"><COL><DATA> Seventy-one patients with poor-prognosis breast cancer were enrolled after informed consent in a multicentre randomized study to evaluate the use of selected peripheral blood CD34+ cells to support haematopoietic recovery following high-dose chemotherapy. Patients who responded to conventional chemotherapy were mobilized with chemotherapy (mainly high-dose cyclophosphamide) and/or recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF). Patients who reached the threshold of 20 CD34+ cells per microl of peripheral blood underwent apheresis and were randomized at that time to receive either unmanipulated mobilized blood cells or selected CD34+ cells. For patients in the study arm, CD34+ cells were selected from aphereses using the Isolex300 device. Fifteen patients failed to mobilize peripheral blood progenitors and nine other patients were excluded for various reasons. Forty-seven eligible patients were randomized into two comparable groups. CD34+ cells were selected from aphereses in the study group. Haematopoietic recovery occurred at similar times in both groups. No side-effect related to the infusion of selected cells was observed. The frequency of epithelial tumour cells in aphereses was low (8 out of 42 evaluated patients), as determined by immunocytochemistry.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women (1,523) enrolled onto National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B-18 were randomly assigned to preoperative or postoperative AC therapy. Clinical tumor response to preoperative therapy was graded as complete (cCR), partial (cPR), or no response (cNR). Tumors with a cCR were further categorized as either pathologic complete response (pCR) or invasive cells (pINV). Disease-free survival (DFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and survival were estimated through 5 years and compared between treatment groups. In the preoperative arm, proportional-hazards models were used to investigate the relationship between outcome and tumor response. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in DFS, DDFS, or survival (P = .99, .70, and .83, respectively) among patients in either group. More patients treated preoperatively than postoperatively underwent lumpectomy and radiation therapy (67.8% v 59.8%, respectively). Rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after lumpectomy were similar in both groups (7.9% and 5.8%, respectively; P = .23). Outcome was better in women whose tumors showed a pCR than in those with a pINV, cPR, or cNR (relapse-free survival [RFS] rates, 85.7%, 76.9%, 68.1%, and 63.9%, respectively; P &lt; .0001), even when baseline prognostic variables were controlled. When prognostic models were compared for each treatment group, the preoperative model, which included breast tumor response as a variable, discriminated outcome among patients to about the same degree as the postoperative model. CONCLUSION: Preoperative chemotherapy is as effective as postoperative chemotherapy, permits more lumpectomies, is appropriate for the treatment of certain patients with stages I and II disease, and can be used to study breast cancer biology. Tumor response to preoperative chemotherapy correlates with outcome and could be a surrogate for evaluating the effect of chemotherapy on micrometastases; however, knowledge of such a response provided little prognostic information beyond that which resulted from postoperative therapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="88"><COL><DATA> The purpose of this study was to develop a less toxic outpatient chemotherapy regimen for mobilizing peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). Three hundred eighteen patients with newly diagnosed stage II-III breast cancer who had received conventional dose adjuvant chemotherapy were randomized to receive intermediate-dose cyclophosphamide (2 g/m2), etoposide (600 mg/m2), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) 6 micrograms/kg/day (ID-Cy, n = 162) or high-dose cyclophosphamide (4 g/m2) and the same doses of etoposide and G-CSF (HD-Cy, n = 156) followed by collection of PBSC. Three hundred seventeen of 318 patients had apheresis performed, and 315 received high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by PBSC support. The median numbers of CD34+ cells collected in a median of two apheresis following ID-Cy and HD-Cy were 19.9 and 22.2 x 10(6)/kg, respectively (p = 0.04). The fractions of patients achieving CD34+ cell doses &gt; or = 2.5 or &gt; or = 5.0 x 10(6)/kg were not different between the two regimens. More patients receiving HD-Cy had grade 3-4 nausea (p = 0.001), vomiting (p = 0.03), and mucositis (p = 0.04). The fractions of patients having a neutrophil nadir &lt; 0.5 x 10(9)/L following ID-Cy and HD-Cy were 0.83 and 0.95, respectively (p = &lt; 0.001). The fractions of patients having a platelet nadir &lt; 25 x 10(9)/L following ID-Cy and HD-Cy were 0.13 and 0.51, respectively (p = &lt; 0.001). More patients in the HD-Cy group received platelet (p &lt; 0.001) and red blood cell (p &lt; 0.001) transfusions and were admitted to the hospital more frequently (p = 0.03) than patients receiving ID-Cy. Three hundred fifteen patients received HDC followed by infusion of PBSC. There were no significant differences in the incidence of transplant-related death or early survival between patients receiving ID-Cy or HD-Cy followed by HDC.

METHODS: At our Institutions 119 postmenopausal breast cancer patients were randomized from August 1987 to March 1995 to tamoxifen only within adjuvant studies (International Breast Cancer Study Group studies VII and IX) and 202 healthy hysterectomized women aged 35-70 years were randomized from November 1993 to May 1996 in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled chemoprevention study (Italian Tamoxifen Prevention Study). The tamoxifen dose was 20 mg/day for 5 years in all studies. Median age was 66 years (54-85) in the adjuvant studies and 53 years (37-69) in the chemoprevention study. Median treatment duration was 238 and 120 weeks, respectively. RESULTS: Patients treated within adjuvant studies experienced more hot flashes, vaginal discharge and/or bleeding, bone marrow depression and weight gain than those treated in the chemoprevention study, consistent with the fact that a proportion of women in the latter study were receiving placebo. Temporary discontinuation occurred in 2.5% of patients in the adjuvant studies and in 5.4% of women in the chemoprevention study (difference not statistically significant). Permanent discontinuation was more frequent in the chemoprevention study than in the adjuvant ones (26.7% vs 15.1%--P&lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our data show that, although the toxicity of tamoxifen is superimposable in the two settings, a larger proportion of women treated as chemoprevention discontinue treatment spontaneously. Due to the double-blind nature of the chemoprevention study, the impact of the toxicity of tamoxifen upon compliance in the chemopreventive setting cannot be ascertained</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="91"><COL><DATA> AIMS: Preservation of the intercostal-brachial nerve is advocated to reduce side effects of axillary dissection for breast cancer. We conducted a prospective randomized trail to compare functional results: sensory deficit and/or shoulder pain in preserved (group I) vs sacrificed (group II) intercostal-brachial nerve (IBN). METHODS: From July 1993 to April 1994, 128 patients presenting with an invasive operable breast cancer were operated on by mastectomy n = 28 or lumpectomy n = 100 and axillary dissection. The patients were eligible for randomization when the IBN was preserved at the end of the axillary dissection. Group I (nerve preservation) included 66 patients and group II (nerve section) 62 patients. RESULTS: The two groups were well balanced for TNM, type of surgery, number of nodes dissected and positive, post-operative adjuvant treatment. Examinations were conducted at 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Sensory deficit in the IBN area was reported by one patient in group I and four patients in group II, at 3 months (P = 0.36, NS). No patients, apart from one in group II, reported functional trouble at 18 months. Major shoulder motion, limitation and pain developed in four patients in group I and three in group II (NS). This was attributed to depression and treated adequately. Analysis of sensory deficit was impossible in these patients.

The remaining 156 patients, 149 men and 7 women, mean (SD) age 58 (9) years range 36 to 77, were randomly allocated to either a control group without chemotherapy (n = 84) or a group treated by chemotherapy (n = 72). Patients were divided into four strata: I = complete resection of the tumour but with lymph node involvement (n = 62); II = incomplete resection of tumour leaving gross tumour behind (n = 58); III = no resection because of local or regional invasion (n = 22) ; and IV = no resection because of distant metastasis (n = 14). Exclusion criteria were histologically confirmed tracheobronchial involvement, oesophagotracheal fistula, Karnosky score &lt; 50, cerebral metastases, or hepatic metastases occupying more than 30% of the liver, peritoneal carcinomatosis, associated or previously treated ear-nose-throat carcinoma, or complete resection of tumour without lymph node involvement. INTERVENTIONS: 5 fluorouracil (5FU) and cisplatin (CDDP) were given in 5-day courses, once every 28 days, for a maximum of eight cycles. 5 FU, 1 g/m2, was infused for 24 hours after a water overload, during five days. Cisplatin was given either in one dose of 100 mg/m2 at the beginning of the cycle or 20 mg/m2/day over three hours for five days. Duration of treatment ranged from 6-8 months. OUTCOME MEASURES: Median and actuarial survival. The subsidiary endpoint was quality of survival judged by complications of treatment, swallowing disorders, and the duration of ability to feed normally. RESULTS: There was no difference in survival, either overall (median = 12 months) or in any of the strata. There were however significantly more patients with neurological (p &lt; 0.003), haematological (p &lt; 0.0001), and renal (p &lt; 0.0002) complications in the treated group compared with the control group. Four patients (6%) died of complications of chemotherapy. The course of swallowing disorders did not differ between the two groups. The duration of autonomous oral feeding was exactly the same in both groups (median = 10.5 months). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that 5FU and CDDP do not help in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus whether or not the tumour has been resected</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="149"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: We performed a multi-institutional randomized trial comparing preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery with surgery alone for patients with local and operable esophageal cancer. METHODS: Preoperative chemotherapy for patients randomly assigned to the chemotherapy group included three cycles of cisplatin and fluorouracil. Surgery was performed two to four weeks after the completion of the third cycle; patients also received two additional cycles of chemotherapy after the operation. Patients randomly assigned to the immediate-surgery group underwent the same surgical procedure. The main end point was overall survival. RESULTS: Of the 440 eligible patients with adequate data , 213 were assigned to receive preoperative chemotherapy and 227 to undergo immediate surgery. After a median possible study time of 55.4 months, there were no significant differences between the two groups in median survival: 14.9 months for the patients who received preoperative chemotherapy and 16.1 months for those who underwent immediate surgery (P=0.53). At one year, the survival rate was 59 percent for those who received chemotherapy and 60 percent for those who had surgery alone; at two years, survival was 35 percent and 37 percent, respectively. The toxic effects of chemotherapy were tolerable, and the addition of chemotherapy did not appear to increase the morbidity or mortality associated with surgery. There were no differences in survival between patients with squamous-cell carcinoma and those with adenocarcinoma. Weight loss was a significant predictor of poor outcome (P=0.03). With the addition of chemotherapy, there was no change in the rate of recurrence at locoregional or distant sites.

Since cure is usually not possible, the goal of treatment is the palliation of dysphagia. Palliative modalities include bougies, balloons, stents, tumor probe, laser, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. In recent years, combined chemotherapy and radiation has shown promising results. However, the relief of dysphagia is slow and frequently incomplete. We compared the effectiveness of dilatation alone versus dilatation plus Nd-YAG laser therapy for the relief of dysphagia while assessing the role of chemotherapy and radiation as an adjunct to surgery. Fifteen patients with squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus who were deemed fit for intensive chemotherapy and radiation were randomized to receive either dilatation alone (N = 7) or dilatation plus laser (N = 8); the end-point for initial success was the passage of a 45 French Savary dilator, and the relief of dysphagia. At entry, 13 of these 15 patients were judged potentially resectable. However, after chemotherapy and radiation, only 3 of 13 (20%) patients could be offered surgery; the remainder were considered too poor a surgical risk. Follow-up was for 30 months, or until death. Further dilatations were performed as needed for relief of dysphagia. No difference was observed between the laser plus dilatation and the dilatation alone group with respect to the degree of dysphagia, weight record, quality of life index (Karnofsky score), or mortality rate. Our results indicate that in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation for esophageal carcinoma, dilatation alone provides adequate palliation of dysphagia, and in these patients, chemotherapy and radiation is a poor adjunct to surgical treatment</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="152"><COL><DATA> Squamous cell cancer of the esophagus is the most common cancer among black South African males, and 60% of patients present with localized inoperable disease. Combined chemoradiotherapy has been reported to be superior to radiotherapy alone for localized inoperable esophageal cancer in North American patients. A study was carried out to determine if this was also applicable to South African patients, who present with more advanced disease. From September 1991 through June 1995, 70 patients with locally advanced (T3N0-1M0) squamous cancer of the esophagus were prospectively randomized to receive radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy combined with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. There was no statistically significant survival difference between the two groups. The median survival was 144 days in the group receiving radiotherapy alone, and 170 days in the group receiving radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy (p = 0.42). The degree of weight loss before initiation of therapy had a significant effect on survival regardless of the treatment arm. Radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy, as administered in this study for South African patients with locally advanced, inoperable squamous cancer of the esophagus, is no better than radiotherapy alone</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="153"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND/AIM OF STUDY: Laser therapy is effective in relieving malignant dysphagia, but repeated treatments at 4 to 6 week intervals are usually required. This prospective randomised trial is designed to determine if addition of brachytherapy offers any advantages over laser therapy alone. METHODS: Patients with inoperable carcinoma of the oesophagus were randomised to receive either endoscopic Nd:YAG laser therapy alone, or laser followed by brachytherapy. Patients who developed worsening dysphagia during follow-up were offered further treatment as appropriate. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were randomised to receive laser only, and 12 to receive laser followed by brachytherapy. Of these 12, one was lost to follow-up and four did not receive brachytherapy because they were unfit, had extension into the cardia or had mainly extrinsic compression. These 4 are included on an &apos;intention-to-treat&apos; basis. The mean therapeutic interval for the brachytherapy group was significantly longer, 83 days compared to 36 days for the laser group (p = 0.026). There were no differences in the degree of dysphagia relief, number of endoscopic procedures or survival times. CONCLUSION: The preliminary results of this trial suggest that brachytherapy in addition to laser therapy prolongs the first therapeutic interval.

However, recurrent dysphagia caused by tumor ingrowth in uncoated types remains a problem. In addition, prior radiation and/or chemotherapy may entail an increased risk of complications. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with an esophagogastric carcinoma were randomly assigned to placement of a latex prosthesis under general anesthesia or a coated, self-expanding metal stent under sedation. At entry, patients were stratified for location of the tumor in the esophagus or cardia and for prior radiation and/or chemotherapy. RESULTS: Technical success and improvement in dysphagia score were similar in both groups. Major complications were more frequent with latex prostheses (47%) than with metal stents (16%) (odds ratio 4.07: 95% CI [1.35, 12.50], p = 0.014). Recurrent dysphagia was not different between latex prostheses (26%) and metal stents (24%). Hospital stay was longer, on average, after placement of latex prostheses than metal stents (6.3 +/- 5.2 versus 4.3 +/- 2.3 days; p = 0.043). Only prior radiation and/or chemotherapy increased the risk of specific device-related complications with respect to the esophagus (12 of 28 [43%] versus 8 of 47 [17%]; odds ratio 3.66: 95% CI [1.24, 10.82], p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: Coated, self-expanding metal stents are associated with fewer complications and shorter hospital stay as compared with latex prostheses, and prior radiation and/or chemotherapy increases the risk of device-related complications with respect to the esophagus</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="155"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Recurrence of thoracic esophageal carcinoma in the cervical and superior mediastinal lymph nodes occurs frequently and contributes to a poor prognosis. Extensive lymphadenectomy has been advocated. Findings in support of this to date, however, have been based on a comparison with historical controls. We herein report a prospective randomized trial of extended and conventional lymphadenectomy. METHODS: Cases of thoracic esophageal carcinoma meeting criteria predictive of complete resection were randomized into conventional and extended cervical and superior mediastinal lymphadenectomy groups. RESULTS: In the extended and conventional lymphadenectomy groups, respectively, mean operative time was 487 +/- 47 and 396 +/- 43 minutes, blood loss was 850 +/- 429 and 576 +/- 261 mL, node count was 82 +/- 22 and 43 +/- 15, hospital deaths occurred in 3% and 7%, 2-year survival was 83.3% and 64.8%, 5-year survival was 66.2% and 48.0%, and recurrence rate was 19.9% and 24.1%.

METHODS: All patients were included in a prospective randomized trial comparing laparoscopic-assisted colectomy (LAC) versus open colectomy (OC) for colon cancer. The randomization was stratified for localization of the lesion. Patients with metastasic disease at time of the surgery were excluded. Follow-up in the outpatient clinic was done every 3 months for a minimum of 12 months. Endpoints for the study were metastasis at port site and laparotomy incision as well as recurrence rate. RESULTS: Of 91 segmental colectomies performed from November 1993 to January 1996, there were 44 LAC and 47 OC. Patient data were similar in both groups (age, sex, Dukes stage, type of operation). Mean follow-up was 21.4 months, with a range of 13 to 41 months. There were no wounds or PSM in those series. RR was similar for both groups. For LAC, it was five of 31 (16.1%); for OC, it was six of 40 (15%). CONCLUSIONS: The laparoscopic approach has a recurrence rate similar to that for open procedures for colon cancer. However, additional follow-up of these patients is needed before we can determine whether or not the laparoscopic approach influences overall survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="219"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: There is conflicting evidence on the efficacy of regional adjuvant chemotherapy, via portal-vein infusion (PVI), after resection of colorectal cancer. We undertook a randomised controlled multicentre trial to investigate the efficacy of PVI (500 mg/m2 fluorouracil plus 5000 IU heparin daily for 7 days). METHODS: 1235 of about 1500 potentially eligible patients were randomly assigned surgery plus PVI or surgery alone (control). The patients were followed up for a median of 63 months, with yearly screening for recurrent disease. The primary endpoint was survival; analyses were by intention to treat. FINDINGS: 619 patients in the control group and 616 in the PVI group met eligibility criteria. 164 (26%) control-group patients and 173 (28%) PVI-group patients died. 5-year survival did not differ significantly between the groups (73 vs 72%; 95% Cl for difference -6 to 4). The control and PVI groups were also similar in terms of disease-free survival at 5 years (67 vs 65%) and the number of patients with liver metastases (79 vs 77%). INTERPRETATION: PVI of fluorouracil, at a dose of 500 mg/m2 for 7 days, cannot be recommended as the sole adjuvant treatment for high-risk colorectal cancer after complete surgical excision. However, these results cannot eliminate a small benefit when PVI is used at a higher dosage or in combination with mitomycin</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="220"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: The possible immunosuppressive effect of blood transfusion and its influence on survival after surgery for cancer makes it worthwhile to seek methods to avoid transfusion wherever possible. Patients with right-sided colonic cancer are frequently anaemic. Such patients were entered into a study that employed erythropoietin to avoid homologous transfusion. METHODS: In a prospectively randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicentre trial, patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin concentration greater than 8.5 g/dl and less than or equal to 13.5 g/dl) presenting with right-sided colonic cancer and scheduled for hemicolectomy were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin beta) 20,000 units/day subcutaneously or placebo for at least 10 days over the operative period. RESULTS: Perioperative treatment with epoetin beta was well tolerated and there were no significant differences in morbidity and mortality. Following hemicolectomy, median cumulative blood loss in the two groups was similar (epoetin beta 440 ml versus placebo 345 ml). Sixteen (33 per cent) of 48 patients treated with epoetin beta and 15 (28 per cent) of 54 in the placebo group received perioperative blood transfusions (P not significant). The increase in reticulocyte count between baseline and the last preoperative value was more pronounced in the epoetin beta group than in those receiving placebo (P = 0.036). CONCLUSION: Despite the perioperative administration of 20,000 units erythropoietin per day for at least 10 days, it was not possible to reduce the intraoperative and postoperative transfusion need. None the less, a positive change in the haematological variables of treated patients was clearly discernible. The negative result may be due to the short treatment interval and to iron deficiency, which was present in the majority of patients. The general change of attitude towards allogeneic blood transfusion is demonstrated by the overall low frequency of blood transfusion in this study</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="221"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: This study had two major goals: (1) to assess the effectiveness of a regimen of fluorouracil (5-FU) plus levamisole plus leucovorin as postoperative surgical adjuvant therapy for patients with high-risk colon cancer, and (2) to evaluate 6 months versus 12 months of chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with poor-prognosis stage II or III colon cancer were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with either intensive-course 5-FU and leucovorin combined with levamisole, or a standard regimen of 5-FU plus levamisole. Patients were also randomly assigned to receive either 12 months or 6 months of chemotherapy, which resulted in four treatment groups. RESULTS: Eight hundred ninety-one of 915 patients entered (97.4%) were eligible. The median follow-up duration is 5.1 years for patients still alive. There was a difference among the four treatment groups with respect to patient survival, and a significant duration-by-regimen interaction was observed. Specifically, standard 5-FU plus levamisole was inferior to 5-FU plus leucovorin plus levamisole when treatment was given for 6 months (5-year survival rate, 60% v 70%; P &lt; .01). CONCLUSION: There was no significant improvement in patient survival when chemotherapy was given for 12 months compared with 6 months. When chemotherapy was given for 6 months, standard 5-FU plus levamisole was associated with inferior patient survival compared with intensive-course 5-FU plus leucovorin plus levamisole. These data suggest that 5-FU plus levamisole for 6 months should not be used in clinical practice, whereas 6 months of treatment with 5-FU plus leucovorin plus levamisole is effective</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="255"><COL><DATA> A total of 48 patients suffering from rectum cancer were included in this randomized study conducted at the Proctology Department of the Donetsk Regional Anti-Cancer Center. Patients in group I (24 patients) received an intensive course of high fractional X-ray therapy (cumulative dose up to 25 Gy) with direct protracted endolymphatic chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) instilled in 600 mg/m2 each day before operation, up to a cumulative dose of 5 g. The 24 patients in group II were treated with Ukrain as monotherapy, 10 mg each second day before operation (up to a cumulative dose of 60 mg) and a total of 40 mg after surgical intervention. Repeated Ukrain courses (100 mg/per course) were also given 6 months after surgical operation. In each ease preoperative treatment was followed by routine surgical operation.

This will have an impact on the primary treatment of rectal cancer. This study investigates the effect of preoperative high-dose radiotherapy on long-term bowel function in patients treated with anterior resection. METHODS: A questionnaire was answered by 92 percent (203/220) of patients who were included in the Swedish Rectal Cancer Trial and who were alive after a minimum of five years. Thirty-two patients were excluded, mainly because of postoperative stomas and dementia, which left 171 for analysis. RESULTS: Median bowel frequency per week was 20 in the irradiated group (n = 84) and 10 in the surgery-alone group (n = 87; P &lt; 0.001). Incontinence for loose stools (P &lt; 0.001), urgency (P &lt; 0.001), and emptying difficulties (P &lt; 0.05) were all more common after irradiation. Sensory functions such as &quot;discrimination between gas and stool&quot; and &quot;ability to safely release flatus&quot; did not, however, differ between groups. Thirty percent of the irradiated group stated that they had an impaired social life because of bowel dysfunction, compared with 10 percent of the surgery-alone group (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that high-dose radiotherapy influences long-term bowel function, thus emphasizing the need for finding predictive factors for local recurrence to exclude patients with a very high probability for cure with surgery alone and to use optimized radiation techniques</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="298"><COL><DATA> We examined the effects of postoperative 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusions and oral treatment with 1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil (HCFU) on patients curatively resected for stages II-IV colorectal cancer. The study was prospectively randomized, and 251 (93.3%) of 269 patients were valid candidates for statistical assessment. The inductive regimen for group A included 5-FU 10 mg intravenous (i.v.) injections on days 0, 1, 2, 7, 8 and 9, postoperatively. For maintenance therapy, group A received HCFU 300 mg orally and daily for 52 weeks beginning 2 weeks after surgery. The regimen for group B included only 5-FU injections. The effects of this chemotherapy were also retrospectively analyzed for groups at a high risk for recurrence, stages III-IV, transmural invasion-positive and lymph node metastasis-positive cases. There was no statistical difference in survival time between the groups for 251 eligible cases (p = 0.079). In group A given 5-FU plus HCFU, there was a reduction in the recurrence rate for patients with stages III-IV or lymph node metastasis-positive colorectal cancers (p &lt; 0.05) and prolongation of the survival time for patients with stage III-IV, transmural invasion-positive or lymph node-positive colorectal cancers (p &lt; 0.05).

The fall in the mean haematocrit from baseline to the last pre-operative value was significantly lower in the rhEPO group (41.4 to 37.6% versus 41.8 to 34.8%, P = 0.0004). rhEPO increases the ability of cancer patients to donate autologous blood during a short pre-operative period and enhances the restoration of haematological values after the donation period</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="331"><COL><DATA> The use of bolus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as a short-term infusion over 10-30 min is increasing at the cost of a push injection, mainly due to practical advantages. Since even a short prolongation of the administration time results in lower 5-FU peak and area under the curve (AUC) levels, there might be a risk of decreased efficacy. The aim of this study was to compare a rapid intravenous (i.v.) 5-FU injection and a short-term 5-FU infusion with respect to objective responses and toxicity in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. 203 patients with measurable advanced colorectal cancer were randomised to bolus 5-FU either as an injection for 2-4 min or as a short-term infusion lasting 10-20 min. In both groups, the 5-FU dose was 500 mg/m2 and leucovorin 60 mg/m2 was given 40 min after the start of 5-FU. Treatment was given on two successive days every other week until progression. Objective tumour regression was seen in 27/100 (27%) in the injection group and in 13/103 (13%) in the infusion group (P = 0.02). Severe toxicity was rare and did not differ significantly between the groups. Progression-free survival tended to be longer in the injection group (P = 0.07), but overall survival did not differ between the groups. Bolus 5-FU should be administered as a rapid i.v. injection rather than as a short-term infusion, since the former rate of administration results in a higher response rate without being significantly more toxic</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="333"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Our aim was to test the hypothesis that laparoscopic-assisted resection for colorectal cancer has an immunologic advantage over traditional open surgery. METHODS: Sixteen patients with colorectal cancer were randomized to undergo laparoscopic-assisted resection or open surgery. Basic patient data were recorded, and serum interleukin-6 levels, relative proportions of lymphocytes, and human leukocyte antigen-DR expression on monocytes were determined at specific time intervals. RESULTS: Operating time was longer for laparoscopic-assisted resection (P=0.02), but analgesic requirements were less (P=0.04). All patients exhibited the following: interleukin-6 levels increased to a maximum at 4 hours and returned to preoperative levels within 48 hours. This response appeared greater for open resection (mean peak level, 313 vs. 173 pg/ml; P=0.25). Relative granulocytosis (P &lt; 0.001) was seen within 48 hours, which was offset by a decrease in percentage of lymphocytes (P &lt; 0.001). Changes in lymphocyte subfractions were most significant seven days postsurgery: natural killer cells decreased (P=0.003); T cells increased (P=0.008), with elevation in the CD4/CD8 ratio (P=0.003). B cells were largely unchanged at all time periods. Human leukocyte antigen-DR expression on monocytes was significantly less at 48 hours postsurgery (P &lt; 0.001). All changes were reversed within three weeks of surgery. There were no differences when comparing laparoscopic-assisted resection with open surgery.

Because of this concern, the routine use of intraperitoneal chemotherapy after laparoscopic colectomy for cancer was suggested recently. We assessed if laparoscopic vs. conventional surgery increases exfoliated malignant cells in the peritoneal cavity during resection of colorectal cancer. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized fashion, 38 colorectal cancer patients undergoing an elective, curative operation were assigned to either a conventional or laparoscopic procedure between June 1996 and May 1997. In either group (n = 19), after the abdominal cavity was entered, saline was instilled into the peritoneal cavity, and the fluid was collected (Specimen 1). During surgery, all irrigating fluids were collected (Specimen 2). Both specimens were assessed for malignancy using four techniques: filtration process (ThinPrep), smear, cell block, and immunochemistry using Ber-EP4. The change in the amount of tumor cells in both specimens was compared between surgical groups. A pilot study was performed to validate the proposed cytologic method. RESULTS: In the pilot study of 20 consecutive patients with colorectal cancer, postresectional peritoneal cytology was positive in six patients, including two Stage II (T3, N0, M0) patients. The pilot study also validated that our semiquantitative scoring system can be reliably used to assess the amount of free peritoneal cancer cells. In the main study, 16 right colectomies, 3 extended right colectomies, 17 proctosigmoidectomies, and 1 left colectomy were performed. The T and N stages were T1 (n = 13, T2 (n = 5), T3 (n = 8), T4 (n = 11); N0 (n =22), N1 (n = 8), N2 (n = 7). Malignant cells were not detected in any Specimens 1 or, more importantly, in Specimens 2 in either surgical group.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a prospective, randomized trial in one surgical department comparing laparoscopic (LAP) and conventional (CON) techniques in 109 patients undergoing bowel resection for colorectal cancers or polyps. Postoperatively, all patients underwent measurement of pulmonary function tests every 12 hours, and were treated identically on a highly controlled protocol with regard to analgesic administration, feeding, and postoperative care. RESULTS: Of the 55 patients assigned to LAP and 54 to the CON group, there were 42 and 38 with cancer, respectively (the other patients had large adenomas). Overall recovery of 80% of forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity was a median of 3 days for LAP and 6.0 days for CON (p = 0.01). LAP patients used significantly less morphine than CON patients up to the second day after surgery (0.78 +/- 0.32 versus 0.92 +/- 0.34 mg/kg per day, p = 0.02). Flatus returned a median of 3.0 days after LAP versus 4.0 days after CON surgery (p = 0.006). Tumor margins were clear in all patients. After a median followup of 1.5 years (LAP) and 1.7 years (CON), there were no port site recurrences in the LAP group. Seven cancer-related deaths have occurred (three in the LAP group, four in the CON group). CONCLUSIONS: Within this prospective, randomized trial, laparoscopic techniques were as safe as conventional surgical techniques and offered a faster recovery of pulmonary and gastrointestinal function compared with conventional surgery for selected patients undergoing large bowel resection for cancer or polyps.

METHODS: Between 1987 and 1990, 207 consecutive patients who underwent curative resections for primary untreated large-bowel carcinoma were randomly assigned to a conventional follow-up group (Group A; n = 103) and to an intense follow-up group (Group B; n = 104). All the patients were followed up prospectively, and the outcome was known for all of them at five years. Patients in Group A were seen at six-month intervals for one year, and once a year thereafter. Patients in Group B were checked every three months during the first two years, at six-month intervals for the next three years, and once a year thereafter. RESULTS: Of the 103 patients in Group A, local recurrence was detected in 20; 9 (13 percent) of these patients had colon cancer, and 11 (29 percent) had rectal cancer. Of the 104 patients in Group B, local recurrence was detected in 26; 12 (16 percent) of these patients had colon cancer, and 14 (45 percent) had rectal cancer. Twelve cases (60 percent) of local recurrence in Group A and 24 cases (92 percent) in Group B were detected at scheduled visits (P &lt; 0.05). Local recurrences were detected earlier in patients of Group B (10.3 +/- 2.7 vs. 20.2 +/- 6.1 months; P &lt; 0.0003). Curative re-resection was possible in 2 patients (10 percent) in Group A, 1 with colon cancer and 1 with rectal cancer, and in 17 patients (65 percent) in Group B, 6 with colon cancer and 11 with rectal cancer (P &lt; 0.01). Of the Group B patients who had curative re-resections of local recurrence, 8 (47 percent) were disease-free and long-term survivors as of the last follow-up, and 2 (11.7 percent) were alive, but with a new recurrence. The 2 patients in Group A who had curative re-resections died as a result of cancer. The five-year survival rate in Group A was 58.3 percent and in Group B was 73.1 percent. The difference is statistically significant (P &lt; 0.02).

The laparoscopic approach to colorectal tumors may result in less pain as well as less fatigue, and may improve postoperative recovery after colorectal resections. METHODS: Sixty patients were included into a prospective randomized trial to determine the influence of laparoscopic (n = 30) or conventional (n = 30) resection of colorectal tumors on postoperative pain and fatigue. Major endpoints of the study were dose of morphine sulfate during patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), visual analog scale for pain while coughing (VASC), and visual analogue scale for fatigue (VASF). Efficacy of pain medication was assessed by visual analogue score at rest (VASR). RESULTS: Preoperative age, sex, stage, and localization of tumors were comparable in both groups. The PCA dose of morphine given immediately after surgery until postoperative day 4 was higher in the conventional group (median, 1.37 mg/kg; 5-95 percentile 0.71-2. 46 mg/kg) than the laparoscopic group (0.78 mg/kg; 0.24-2.38 mg/kg, p &lt; 0.01). Postoperative VASR was comparable between both groups, but VASC was higher from the first to the seventh postoperative day (p &lt; 0.01). Postoperative fatigue was higher after conventional than after laparoscopic surgery from the second to the seventh day (p &lt; 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that analgetic requirements are lower and pain is less intense after laparoscopic than after conventional colorectal resection. Patients also experience less fatigue after minimal invasive surgery. Because of these differences, the duration of recovery is shortened, and the postoperative quality of life is improved after laparoscopic colorectal resections</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="339"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: A shorter duration of postoperative ileus and earlier oral alimentation of patients may be a clinically relevant benefit of laparoscopic compared with conventional colorectal resection. PATIENTS/METHODS: A total of 60 patients were randomised to either laparoscopic (n=30) or conventional (n=30) resection of colorectal tumours. Major endpoints were the postoperative time to the first bowel movement and the time until oral feeding without parenteral alimentation was tolerated. Minor endpoints were the postoperative interval to the first peristalsis and first passage of flatus, the distribution of radio-opaque markers in abdominal radiographs on day 3 and day 5 and the incidence of postoperative vomiting. RESULTS: Age, gender. ASA-classification and type of resection were comparable in the two groups. Peristalsis was first noticed 26+/-9 h after laparoscopic and 38+/-17 h after conventional colorectal resection (P&lt;0.01). First flatus occurred 50+/-19 h after laparoscopic and 79+/-21 h after conventional surgery (P&lt;0.01). The incidence of postoperative vomiting was similar in both groups. Three days after surgery radio-opaque markers were found more often in the right colon (P&lt;0.01) and less often in the small intestine (P&lt;0.05) in laparoscopic compared with conventional patients. Five days after laparoscopic surgery, more markers had reached the left colon (P&lt;0.05). The first bowel movement occurred 70+/-32 h after laparoscopic and 91+/-22 h after conventional resection (P&lt;0.01). Oral feeding without additional parenteral alimentation was tolerated 3.3+/-0.7 days after laparoscopic and 5.0+/-1.5 days after conventional surgery (P&lt;0.01). CONCLUSION: The shorter duration of postoperative ileus allows earlier restoration of oral feeding after laparoscopic compared with conventional colorectal resection and therefore increases quality of life immediately after resection of colorectal tumours</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="353"><COL><DATA> The purpose of this study was to compare the objective response rate, duration of remission, and survival of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) versus those of 5-FU plus levamisole in metastatic colorectal cancer using the same dose and schedule of these agents as in the North Central Cancer Treatment Group and intergroup studies of adjuvant therapy. Patients with no prior history of chemotherapy for metastatic disease were entered on this Hoosier Oncology Group randomized Phase III trial. Patients were stratified by Karnofsky performance status and presence or absence of liver metastases. They were randomized to receive 450 mg/m2 5-FU i.v. for 5 days followed by 15 mg/kg i.v. weekly (arm 1) or the same dose of 5-FU plus levamisole 50 mg p.o. every 8 h for 3 days every 2 weeks (arm 2). The duration of treatment for both arms was 26 weeks. From April 1990 to March 1995, 199 patients were entered. One hundred eighty-two patients, 91 in each arm, were fully evaluable. The response rates were 12% on arm 1 and 13% on arm 2. The median duration of response was 18 weeks on both arms. The median survival was 48 weeks on arm 1 and 41 weeks on arm 2 (P = 0.20). This study failed to show any improvement in survival, response, or duration of remission with the addition of levamisole to 5-FU in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="359"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Dietary calcium and antioxidants have been suggested as protective agents against colorectal cancer. This has been supported by animal experimental studies, case control and cohort studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective intervention study of colorectal adenomas, and intermediary stage in colorectal carcinogenesis, 116 polyp-bearing patients received a placebo-controlled daily mixture of beta-carotene 15 mg, vitamin C 150 mg, vitamin E 75 mg, selenium 101 microg, and calcium (1.6 g daily) as carbonate for a period of 3 years with annual colonoscopic follow-up to test if the mixture was able to reduce polyp growth or recurrence. All polyps of &lt; 10 mm at enrollment or follow-up were left unresected until the end of the study. RESULTS: 87-91% of the patients attended the annual endoscopic follow-up investigations, and 19% of the patients dropped out of the medical intervention. The rest consumed 85% of the total amount of tablets over the 3 years. The fecal calcium concentration was 2.3-2.7 times higher in patients taking active medication compared to the placebo group. Diet registration showed that, when adding the intake of antioxidants and calcium from diet and intervention, there was a significant difference between the intake of these substances in the active and the placebo group. No difference was detected in the growth of adenomas between the active and the placebo group from year to year and for the total study period. Moreover, there was no effect on polyps of &lt; 5 or 5-9 mm, or on polyps in the different colonic segments analyzed separately. A reduced growth of adenomas was found in patients &lt;60 years of age taking active medication (n = 8) compared to those taking placebo (n = 6; mean difference 2.3 mm; 95% CI 0.26-4.36). There was a significantly lower number of patients free of new adenomas in the placebo group compared to those taking active medication as tested by logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank test p value 0.035). Subgroup analysis showed that only the group of patients with no family history of colorectal cancer, those with only one adenoma at inclusion, and those &lt;65 years benefitted from the intervention medication. CONCLUSION: The study did not find an overall effect on polyp growth. Our data, however, may support a protective role of calcium and antioxidants on new adenoma formation</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="375"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: As previously shown, antibody treatment increased survival of patients with resected colorectal cancer of stage Dukes&apos; C. Since the 5-year analysis was criticized because of the wide range (2.7 to 7.5 years) of follow-up time, we performed a 7-year analysis with only four of 189 patients monitored for less than 5 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 189 patients with resected Dukes&apos; C colorectal cancer were randomly allocated to infusions of a total of 900 mg 17-1A antibody, 500 mg postoperatively followed by 4 monthly doses of 100 mg (n=99), or to observation only (n=90). Primary end points were overall survival and disease-free interval. Patients were stratified by a dynamic randomization according to center, sex, location of tumor, number of affected lymph nodes, and preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen concentration. RESULTS: Randomization produced balanced distribution of risk factors. After 7 years of follow-up evaluation, treatment had reduced overall mortality by 32% (Cox&apos;s proportional hazard, P &lt; .01; log-rank, P=.01) and decreased the recurrence rate by 23% (Cox&apos;s proportional hazard, P &lt; .04; log-rank, P=.07). The intention-to-treat analysis gave a significant effect for overall survival (Cox&apos;s proportional hazard, P &lt; .01; log-rank, P=.02) and disease-free survival (Cox&apos;s proportional hazard, P=.02; log-rank, P=.11 ). While distant metastases were significantly reduced (Cox&apos;s proportional hazard, P=.004; log-rank, P=.004), local relapses were not (Cox&apos;s proportional hazard, P=.65; log-rank, P=.52). This differential effect of 17-1A antibody on disseminated isolated tumor cells versus occult local satellites may explain the increased significance seen in the overall survival. CONCLUSION: The now-matured study shows that 17-1A antibody administered after surgery prevents the development of distant metastasis in approximately one third of patients. The therapeutic effect is maintained after 7 years of follow-up evaluation</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="377"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Guidelines on the type and frequency of follow-up of patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer are unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the survival benefit of a planned follow-up program. METHODS: Three hundred twenty-five patients who underwent curative resection of colorectal cancer were prospectively randomized to either intensive or standard follow-up. After stratification according to Dukes&apos; stage and site in the colon or rectum, patients were randomized to intensive follow-up of yearly colonoscopy, computerized tomography (CT) of the liver, and chest radiography and clinical review and simple screening vs. structured clinical review and simple screening tests only. RESULTS: On completion of 5-year follow-up, there was no significant difference in survival between the two groups. Yearly colonoscopy failed to detect any asymptomatic local recurrences. Only one asymptomatic curable metachronous colon tumor was detected. Liver CT resulted in earlier detection of hepatic metastases but did not increase the number of curative hepatectomies. Only 1 patient had an asymptomatic CT-detected liver metastasis, and another had an asymptomatic chest radiography-detected lung metastasis. Both had curative resections. CONCLUSIONS: Yearly colonoscopy, liver CT, and chest radiography will not improve survival from colorectal cancer when added to symptom and simple screening review</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="380"><COL><DATA> Although the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) modulated by leucovorin is well established for advanced colorectal cancer, the question of the most effective regimen and optimal dose of leucovorin remains unanswered. This prospective randomized trial compares low-dose (group 1) and high-dose (group 2) leucovorin, combined with the same dose of 5-FU to determine whether high-dose leucovorin was more beneficial than low-dose on overall survival. Inclusion criteria were: unresectable metastatic colorectal carcinoma, with or without evaluable tumor response; a performance status of less than grade 3 (World Health Organization classification); and no previous chemotherapy for metastases. Forty-two patients were randomized in group 1 (leucovorin, 20 mg/m2/day, days 1 through 5) and 41 patients in group 2 (leucovorin, 200 mg/m2/day, days 1-5). All the patients in the two groups received a 1-hour infusion of 400 mg/m2/day 5-FU every 4 weeks. The two groups were matched with no statistically significant differences in gender ratio, site of primary tumor, performance status, and tumor extent. Toxicity in the two regimens was low and not significantly different between the two groups. Overall median survival was 346 days in group 1 and 323 days in group 2 and was not significantly different between the two groups. At 1 year, the test of equivalence was significant (p &lt; 0.01), demonstrating an absence of more than 20% benefit in 1-year survival for the high-dose regimen. The use of high-dose leucovorin combined with 5-FU in the 5-day regimen does not significantly improve overall survival for patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="381"><COL><DATA> Controversy exists regarding the role of prophylactic oophorectomy during resection for primary colorectal cancer. PURPOSE: A prospective, randomized trial was initiated to evaluate the influence of oophorectomy on recurrence and survival in patients with Dukes Stages B and C colorectal cancer. METHOD: Between November 1986 and March 1997, 155 patients were randomized to oophorectomy or no oophorectomy at laparotomy for resection of colorectal cancer. RESULTS: No incidence of gross or microscopic metastatic disease to the ovary was found among 77 patients randomized to oophorectomy, in contrast to previous reports. Preliminary crude survival curves suggested a survival benefit for oophorectomy between two and three years from surgery, but Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that this was not statistically significant and the benefit does not appear to persist at five years. Kaplan-Meier curves of recurrence-free survival, however, suggest a more substantial separation of the curves, with 80 percent vs. 65 percent five-year disease-free survival for oophorectomy vs. nonoophorectomy, but further patient accrual is necessary to provide sufficient statistical power. CONCLUSIONS: Occult colorectal carcinoma metastatic to the ovaries has not been documented in this series of putative Dukes Stages B and C tumors. The possibility of a recurrence-free survival advantage emphasizes the need to continue this preliminary work</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="498"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To determine whether high-dose infusional fluorouracil (FU) is effectively modulated by leucovorin (LV), interferon (IFN) alpha-2b, or both when given to patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 236) with progressive, measurable disease were randomized to three groups and received FU 2,600 mg/m2 as a 24-hour continuous infusion (CI) weekly for 6 weeks with 2 weeks rest (FU24h) and LV 500 mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion before FU or IFN 3 x 10(6) U subcutaneously 3 times weekly or both. Treatment continued until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity was observed. Pairs of treatment arms were analyzed sequentially to detect equivalence or a 25% difference in response rates. RESULTS: The rate of objective remission in patients who received FU24h/LV (44%; 40 of 91) was significantly higher than in patients who received FU24h/IFN (18%; 16 of 90; P &lt; .05). The response rates of patients who received FU24h/LV versus FU24h/LV/IFN (27%; 13 of 49) were statistically equivalent. Significant differences were observed for time to tumor progression (TTP) (FU24h/LV, 7.1 months; FU24h/IFN, 3.9 months; FU24h/LV/IFN, 6.3 months; global P value &lt; .009) and survival (16.6 months, 12.7 months, 19.6 months, respectively; global P value &lt; .04). Unpredictable and life-threatening toxicity in the FU24h/LV/IFN arm required dose reduction of FU to 2,000 mg/m2/day and early stoppage of this arm. Toxicity was manageable in patients who received both FU24h/LV (grade 3 to 4 diarrhea, 21%) and FU24h/IFN (grade 3 to 4 diarrhea, 15%). CONCLUSION: Response rate, TTP, and overall survival were superior for LV-containing regimens compared with IFN modulation alone. The addition of IFN to high-dose infusional FU plus LV offers no advantage and may increase toxicity. The regimen of high-dose infusional FU24h/LV warrants further evaluation in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="500"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of adjuvant hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) on survival relative to resection alone in patients with radical resection of colorectal liver metastases. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Nearly 40% to 50% of all patients with colorectal carcinoma develop liver metastases. Curative resection results in a 5-year survival rate of 25% to 30%. Intrahepatic recurrence occurs after a median of 9 to 12 months in up to 60% of patients. The authors hypothesized that adjuvant intraarterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) might decrease the rate of intrahepatic recurrence and improve survival in patients with radical resection of colorectal liver metastases. METHODS: Between April 5, 1991, and December 31, 1996, patients with colorectal liver metastases from 26 hospitals were stratified by the number of metastases and the site of the primary tumor and randomized to resection of the liver metastases followed by adjuvant HAI of 5-FU (1000 mg/m2 per day for 5 days as a continuous 24-hour infusion) plus folinic acid (200 mg/m2 per day for 5 days as a short infusion), or liver resection only. RESULTS: The first planned intention-to-treat interim analysis after inclusion of 226 patients and 91 events (deaths) showed a median survival of 34.5 months for patients with adjuvant therapy versus 40.8 months for control patients. The median time to progression was 14.2 months for the chemotherapy group versus 13.7 months for the control group. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities (World Health Organization), mainly stomatitis (57.6%) and nausea (55.4%), occurred in 25.6% of cycles and 62.9% of patients. CONCLUSION: According to this planned interim analysis, adjuvant HAI, when used in this dose and schedule in patients with resection of colorectal liver metastases, reduced the risk of death at best by 15%, but at worst the risk of death was doubled. Thus, the chance of detecting an expected 50% improvement in survival by the use of HAI was only 5%. Patient accrual was therefore terminated</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="556"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: This randomized, prospective study assesses the impact of postoperative external-beam radiation therapy on local recurrence (LR), overall survival (OS), and quality of life after limb-sparing resection of extremity sarcomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with extremity tumors and a limb-sparing surgical option were randomized to receive or not receive postoperative adjuvant external-beam radiotherapy. Patients with high-grade sarcomas received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy whereas patients with low-grade sarcomas or locally aggressive nonmalignant tumors were randomized after surgery alone. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients with high-grade lesions were randomized; 47 to receive radiotherapy (XRT) and 44 to not receive XRT. With a median follow-up of 9.6 years, a highly significant decrease (P2 = .0028) in the probability of LR was seen with radiation, but no difference in OS was shown. Of 50 patients with low-grade lesions (24 randomized to resection alone and 26 to resection and postoperative XRT), there was also a lower probability of LR (P2 = .016) in patients receiving XRT, again, without a difference in OS. A concurrent quality-of-life study showed that extremity radiotherapy resulted in significantly worse limb strength, edema, and range of motion, but these deficits were often transient and had few measurable effects on activities of daily life or global quality of life. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that although postoperative external-beam radiotherapy is highly effective in preventing LRs, selected patients with extremity soft tissue sarcoma who have a low risk of LR may not require adjuvant XRT after limb- sparing surgery (LSS)</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="559"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND/AIMS: A prospective randomized clinical trial combining adjuvant locoregional chemoimmunotherapy for pancreatic carcinoma in 512 patients was conducted from September 1991 to September 1998 at Athens Medical Center. METHODOLOGY: All patients were randomly assigned to (A) Resective Surgery (n=274), and (B) Palliative Surgery (n=238) groups. Each group was further subdivided into: (1) surgery alone, and (2) surgery plus 1-day bolus chemotherapy (Gemcitabine 1 gm/m2, Carboplatin 200 mg/m2 and Mitoxantrone 0.2 g/kg bw suspended in 10 ml of Lipiodol and 2 ml of 58% urografin), and immunotherapy (1 ml IL-2 and 0.5 ml gamma-IFN suspended in 5 ml of Lipiodol and 1 ml of 58% urografin) followed by a 5-day course of transplenic and another 5-day course of transtumoral immunotherapy using the same agents. This was repeated at 2-month intervals during the first post-operative year and every 3 months thereafter. RESULTS: Significant reduction in patient symptomatology and improvements in post-treatment quality of life were noted in patients receiving adjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. Moreover, the mean survival rate significantly improved in patients receiving the adjuvant treatment, both for the resective (32 months) and the palliative (16 months) groups.

In patients who have breast cancer and metastatic bone disease, the bisphosphonate clodronate (clodronic acid) reduces the frequency of skeletal complications. Experiments in animals and preliminary clinical observations indicate that early clodronate therapy reduces the incidence of new bony metastases in breast cancer. We investigated the effects of clodronate on the incidence and extent of new metastases in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: Between 1990 and 1995, 302 patients with primary breast cancer and tumor cells in the bone marrow (the presence of which is a risk factor for the development of distant metastases) were randomly assigned to receive clodronate at a dose of 1600 mg per day orally for two years (157 patients) or standard follow-up (145 patients). The median length of observation was 36 months. All patients in both groups received standard surgical treatment and customary hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. RESULTS: Distant metastases were detected in 21 patients in the clodronate group and in 42 patients in the control group (P&lt;0.001). The incidence of both osseous and visceral metastases was significantly lower in the clodronate group than in the control group (P=0.003 for both osseous and visceral metastases).

Eighty consecutive patients were randomized to treatment with embolization (Group A, n = 40), or to symptomatic treatment (Group B, n = 40), there being no differences between both groups regarding the degree of liver function impairment and tumor stage. Eighty-two percent of the patients presented a self-limited postembolization syndrome, without treatment-related mortality. Fifty-five percent of the treated cases exhibited a partial response, which resulted in a lower probability of tumor progression during follow-up (57% vs. 77% at 1 year; P &lt; .005). However, after a median follow-up of 24 months (30 deaths in each group), there are no differences in survival (Group A: 49% and 13%; Group B: 50% and 27%, at 2 and 4 years, respectively; P = .72). The absence of differences was maintained even when dividing patients according to Child-Pugh&apos;s grade, Okuda stage, or performance status test (PST). Furthermore, there were no differences in the probability of complications or in the need of hospital admissions. In conclusion, TAE has a marked antitumoral effect associated to a slower growth of the tumor, but it does not improve the survival of patients with nonsurgical HCC</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="675"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Standard treatment of inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma has not been established. Somatostatin has been shown to possess antimitotic activity against a variety of non-endocrine tumours. AIMS: To assess the presence of somatostatin receptors in human liver and to treat advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with the somatostatin analogue, octreotide. METHODS: Somatostatin receptors were measured in liver tissue homogenates from patients with acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Fifty eight patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma were randomised to receive either subcutaneous octreotide 250 micrograms twice daily, or no treatment. Groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, Okuda classification, presence of cirrhosis, and liver biochemistry and virology. RESULTS: Various amounts of somatostatin receptors were identified in liver tissue of all patients including those with hepatocellular carcinoma. Treated patients had an increased median survival (13 months versus four months, p = 0.002, log rank test) and an increased cumulative survival rate at six and 12 months (75% versus 37%, and 56% versus 13% respectively). Octreotide administration significantly reduced alpha fetoprotein levels at six months. When a multivariable Cox&apos;s proportional hazards model was fitted, variables associated with increased survival were: treatment administration, absence of cirrhosis, increased serum albumin, and small tumours. Treated patients clearly had a lower hazard (0.383) in the multivariate analysis.

DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: A tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: During a 54-month period, 142 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent hepatic resection at 1 institution. Sixty-six patients who survived the operation and had no demonstrable evidence of residual disease on ultrasonographic examination and hepatic angiographic testing at 1 month after surgery agreed to participate in the study. The median follow-up time was 28.3 months. INTERVENTION: Thirty patients received a combination of intravenous epirubicin hydrochloride (8 doses of 40 mg/m2 each at 6-week intervals) and transarterial chemotherapy using an emulsion of iodized oil and cisplatin (3 courses with a maximum dose of 20 mL each at 2-month intervals). Thirty-six patients had no adjuvant treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recurrence rate and disease-free survival. RESULTS: A total of 138 courses of intravenous epirubicin was given to the 30 patients. Sixty-one courses of transarterial chemotherapy were given to only 29 of the 30 patients assigned to the treatment group, because the hepatic artery in 1 patient was thrombosed. Six patients (20%) had chemotherapy-related complications with no mortality. Twenty-three of 30 patients in the treatment group and 17 of 36 patients in the control group had recurrences (P=.01). Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy had a higher incidence of extrahepatic metastases (11 patients vs 5 patients; P=.03). The respective disease-free survival rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 50%,36%, and 18% for the treatment group and 69%, 53%, and 48% for the control group (P=.04).

Different polymer materials may have different effects on clogging. In vitro studies have shown a direct relation between the frictional coefficient of a polymer and the amount of encrusted material. Teflon appeared to be the best polymer for biliary stents. Two different types of stents made of Teflon have been tested in clinical practice and showed favourable patency rates. However, a randomized trial has never been performed. We compared the patency of an Amsterdam-type polyethylene stent with a Teflon stent in a prospective randomized trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1995 and November 1996, 42 patients received a Teflon stent and 42 patients a polyethylene stent. All patients had a distal malignant biliary stricture without a previous drainage procedure. Diagnoses included carcinoma of the pancreas (n = 76), papilla (n = 1), bile duct (n = 5) and metastases (n = 2). The internal and external diameter (10 Fr), length (9 cm) and stent design (a straight stent with two side flaps and one side hole at each end) were similar for both stents. RESULTS: A reduction in bilirubin of more than 20% within one week was seen in 91% of the patients. Early complication rates were similar in both groups (10%). The median follow-up was 142 days. Stent dysfunction occurred in 28 Teflon and 29 polyethylene stents. The thirty-day mortality was 14% in both groups.

Its prevention is a challenging problem, especially in high-risk patients. The authors introduced a new method to prevent surgical wound infections and evaluated its efficacy in a prospective, randomized trial in markedly high-risk patients. METHODS: Patients with biliary tract carcinoma who were scheduled to undergo combined liver and extrahepatic bile duct resection with biliary reconstruction were randomly assigned to one of two groups, well matched in terms of clinical characteristics at baseline. In one group the new treatment was employed (sealed group, n=31), and in the other the wound was treated in the usual fashion (open group, n=28). In the sealed group, povidone-iodine gel was administered to the subcutaneous tissue, and the skin and peritoneum were approximated with a continuous suture. Wound infection was registered up to 30 days after surgery. RESULTS: Wound infection occurred in 18 patients: 5 (16%) patients in the sealed group and 13 (46%) in the open group (P&lt;0.05). All 18 underwent preoperative percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage and had positive bile culture findings. In 13 of these 18 patients (72%) the microorganisms isolated from the infected wound were identical to those in the bile. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm the close association between infected bile and wound infection in hepatobiliary surgery. Our new method, &quot;direct wound sealing,&quot; is simple, easy to perform, virtually cost-free, and has the potential to prevent wound infections even in markedly high-risk patients</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="761"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: The aim of this trial was to compare the outcome achieved with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy to that achieved with radiotherapy alone for patients with locoregionally advanced undifferentiated or poorly differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) meeting one of the following criteria: Ho&apos;s T3 disease, Ho&apos;s N2-N3 disease, or lymph node size &gt; or =3 cm. METHODS: Between September 1989 and August 1993, 334 patients were enrolled in the study, with equal numbers of patients randomized to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy arm (CT arm) and the radiotherapy arm (RT arm). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 2-3 cycles of cisplatin (60 mg/m2 on Day 1) and epirubicin (110 mg/m2 on Day 1) followed by radiotherapy was given to the CT arm. For radiotherapy, a dose of 66-74 gray (Gy) (median, 71 Gy) was delivered to the primary tumor and 60-76 Gy (median, 66 Gy) to the neck. Two hundred eighty-six eligible patients completed the treatment and were evaluable for treatment response (134 in the CT arm, 152 in the RT arm). All patients were included in the survival analysis based on the intention to treat. The median follow-up was 30 months for the whole cohort and 41 months for the surviving patients. RESULTS: Analysis of the 334 patients based on the intention to treat showed no significant difference in relapse free survival (RFS) or overall survival (OS) between the 2 treatment arms (3-year RFS rate: 48% in the CT arm vs. 42% in the RT arm, P = 0.45; 3-year OS rate: 78% vs. 71%, P = 0.57). In an efficacy analysis based on only the 286 evaluable patients, a trend of improved RFS favoring the CT arm was observed (3-year RFS rate: 58% vs. 46%, P = 0.053), with again no significant difference in OS (3-year OS rate: 80% vs. 72%, P = 0.21). In the subgroup of 49 patients with bulky neck lymph nodes &gt;6 cm, improved RFS (3-year RFS rate: 63% vs. 28%, P = 0.026) and OS (3-year OS rate: 73% vs. 37%, P = 0.057) were observed, favoring the CT arm. CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter randomized study did not demonstrate any benefit with the addition of cisplatin-epirubicin neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma; therefore routine administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to this target group cannot be recommended. Although the overall incidence of recurrence was reduced with the addition of chemotherapy in the efficacy analysis, the overall survival was not affected. A more effective chemotherapy regimen, the selection of an appropriate target group, and the use of an alternative strategy for combining chemoradiotherapy should be explored in future trials</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="762"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) coordinated an Intergroup study with the participation of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). This randomized phase III trial compared chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone in patients with nasopharyngeal cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiotherapy was administered in both arms: 1.8- to 2.0-Gy/d fractions Monday to Friday for 35 to 39 fractions for a total dose of 70 Gy. The investigational arm received chemotherapy with cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 22, and 43 during radiotherapy; postradiotherapy, chemotherapy with cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on day 1 and fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m2/d on days 1 to 4 was administered every 4 weeks for three courses. Patients were stratified by tumor stage, nodal stage, performance status, and histology. RESULTS: Of 193 patients registered, 147 (69 radiotherapy and 78 chemoradiotherapy) were eligible for primary analysis for survival and toxicity. The median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 15 months for eligible patients on the radiotherapy arm and was not reached for the chemo-radiotherapy group. The 3-year PFS rate was 24% versus 69%, respectively (P &lt; .001). The median survival time was 34 months for the radiotherapy group and not reached for the chemo-radiotherapy group, and the 3-year survival rate was 47% versus 78%, respectively (P = .005). One hundred eighty-five patients were included in a secondary analysis for survival. The 3-year survival rate for patients randomized to radiotherapy was 46%, and for the chemoradiotherapy group was 76% (P &lt; .001).

There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival between the treatment arms (P = 0.22). Increased toxicity was observed in the treatment arm containing P of which leucopenia, alopecia and nausea/vomiting were the most pronounced.

Our hypothesis was that an adjuvant treatment with low doses of interferon alpha could be effective in patients with localised melanoma. METHODS: After resection of a primary cutaneous melanoma thicker than 1.5 mm, patients without clinically detectable node metastases were randomly assigned to receive either 3x10(6) IU interferon alpha-2a, three-times weekly for 18 months, or no treatment. The primary endpoint was the relapse-free interval. FINDINGS: 499 patients were enrolled, of whom 489 were eligible. When used as part of a sequential procedure, interferon alpha-2a was of significant benefit for relapse-free interval (p=0.038). A long-term analysis, after a median follow-up of 5 years, showed a significant extension of relapse-free interval (p=0.035) and a clear trend towards an increase in overall survival (p=0.059) in interferon alpha-2a-treated patients compared with controls. There were 100 relapses and 59 deaths among the 244 interferon alpha-2a-treated patients compared with 119 relapses and 76 deaths among the 245 controls. The estimated 3-year-relapse rates were 32% in the interferon alpha-2a group and 44% in controls; the 3-year death rates were 15% and 21%, respectively. Only 10% of patients experienced WHO grade 3 or 4 adverse events. Treatment was compatible with normal daily life. INTERPRETATION: Adjuvant therapy of high-risk melanoma with low doses of interferon alpha-2a for 18 months is safe and is beneficial when started before clinically detectable node metastases develop</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="805"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: A phase III, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial of active specific immunotherapy (ASI) using vaccinia melanoma oncolysate (VMO) was performed in patients with stage III (American Joint Commission on Cancer) melanoma to determine the efficacy of VMO to increase the disease-free interval (DFI) or overall survival (OS) in these patients. Two interim analyses of data from this trial were performed in May 1994 and June 1995. Although the results from these analyses showed no statistically significant improvement in DFI or OS in all patients using VMO, two subsets-men aged 44-57 years with one to five positive nodes and all patients with clinical stage I and pathologic stage II disease-showed an overall survival advantage with VMO therapy. A final analysis of data from this trial was performed in May 1996 and is reported here. The design of future melanoma vaccine trials is discussed based on information learned from this first randomized, multicenter trial of ASI therapy. STUDY DESIGN: A polyvalent VMO was prepared using melanoma cells derived from four melanoma cell lines and vaccinia vaccine virus (V). Patients were accrued from 11 United States institutions and were randomized by the Statistical Center at the University of Alabama, Birmingham. Two hundred fifty patients were randomized to treatment with either VMO (1 U containing 2 mg of total protein derived from 5 x 10(6) melanoma cells and 10(5.6) 50% tissue culture infectious dose of vaccinia virus) or control V (1 U containing 10(5.4) 50% tissue culture infectious dose of vaccinia virus) once a week for 13 weeks and then once every 2 weeks for a total of 12 months, or until recurrence. Patient data were collected by the Statistical Center and analyzed as of May 1996 for DFI and OS using Wilcoxon test and log-rank analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred seventeen patients were found to be eligible according to the inclusion criteria. Data from these patients were analyzed for DFI and OS after a median followup of 46.3 months (50.2 months for VMO and 41.3 months for V). This final analysis showed no statistically significant increase in either DFI (p = 0.61) or OS (p = 0.79) of patients treated with VMO (n = 104) compared with V (n = 113). At 2-, 3-, and 5-year intervals, 47.8%, 43.8%, and 41.7% of patients treated with VMO were disease-free, respectively, compared with 51.2%, 44.8%, and 40.4% of patients treated with V. At the same intervals, 70.0%, 60.0%, and 48.6% of patients treated with VMO survived, compared with 65.4%, 55.6%, and 48.2% of patients treated with V. In a retrospective subset analysis, male patients aged 44-57 years (n = 20) with one to five positive nodes showed 18.9%, 26.82%, and 21.3% improvement in survival at 2-, 3-, and 5-year intervals, respectively, after treatment with VMO when compared with V (n = 18) (p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: This study was a randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled evaluation of an active specific immunotherapeutic agent to increase the DFI or OS of patients with stage III melanoma in a surgical adjuvant setting. In this trial, ASI with VMO when compared with V showed no difference in either DFI or OS. In a retrospective subset analysis, however, a subset of men with one to five positive nodes, between the ages of 44 and 57 years, showed a survival advantage with VMO. This result suggests that one must include a detailed subset analysis in the design of future trials of ASI for patients with American Joint Commission on Cancer stage III melanoma. An appropriate control arm also must be included in ASI trials</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="806"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To investigate the response rate, time to treatment failure (TTF), overall survival, and toxicity in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with dacarbazine alone, dacarbazine plus interferon (IFN), dacarbazine plus tamoxifen (TMX), or dacarbazine plus IFN plus TMX. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred seventy-one patients (258 were eligible) were randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial design to receive one of the above treatments. The trial was designed to detect a 50% improvement in survival with 83% power. RESULTS: Nine complete (CRs) and 18 partial responses (PRs) were observed in the patients who received treatments that contained IFN compared with four CRs and 18 PRs in the patients who received treatments that did not contain IFN. Five CRs and 20 PRs occurred in patients treated with TMX compared with eight CRs and 16 PRs in those treated without TMX. Response differences were nonsignificant. The overall median TTF was 2.6 months, and the overall median survival was 8.9 months. There was no significant difference in TTF or survival among any of the different treatments. Poor performance status (PS), hepatic metastases, and weight loss were significant adverse prognostic factors. Twenty-three patients had a TTF greater than 20 months, and these durable responses were evenly distributed among the treatment arms. Significantly more severe and life-threatening toxic events occurred with treatments that contained IFN. CONCLUSION: Neither IFN, TMX, nor the combination significantly improved the response rate, TTF, or survival when added to dacarbazine, but IFN significantly increased toxicity</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="807"><COL><DATA> The purpose of this study was to evaluate in a randomized phase II trial the efficacy and toxicity of combination biochemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with metastatic melanoma. Sixty-five patients with metastatic melanoma (ECOG performance status 0 or 1) were randomized to receive intravenous BCNU 100 mg m(-2) (day 1, alternate courses), cisplatin 25 mg m(-2) (days 1-3), DTIC 220 mg m(-2) (days 1-3) and oral tamoxifen 40 mg (BCDT regimen) with (n = 35) or without (n = 30) subcutaneous interleukin 2 (IL-2) 18 x 10(6) iu t.d.s. (day - 2), 9 x 10(6) iu b.d. (day - 1 and 0) and interferon 2 alpha (IFN-alpha) 9 MU (days 1-3). Evidence for immune activation was determined by flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Treatment was repeated every 4 weeks up to six courses depending on response. The overall response rate of BCDT with IL-2/IFN-alpha was 23% [95% confidence interval (CI) 10-40%] with one complete response (CR) and seven partial responses (PR), and for BCDT alone 27% (95% CI 12-46%) with eight PRs; the median durations of response were 2.8 months and 2.5 months respectively. Sites of response were similar in both groups. There was no difference between the two groups in progression-free survival or overall survival (median survival 5 months for BCDT with IL-2/IFNalpha and 5.5 months for BCDT alone). Although 3 days of subcutaneous IL-2 resulted in significant lymphopenia, evidence of immune activation was indicated by a significant rise in the percentage of CD56- (NK cells) and CD3/HLA-DR-positive (activated T cells) subsets, without any change in the percentage of CD4 or CD4 T-cell subsets. Toxicity assessment revealed a significantly higher incidence of severe thrombocytopenia in patients treated with combination chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone (37% vs 13%, P = 0.03) and a higher incidence of grade 3/4 flu-like symptoms (20% vs 10%) and fatigue (26% vs 13%). The addition of subcutaneous IL-2 and IFNalpha to BCDT chemotherapy in a randomized phase II trial resulted in immune activation but did not improve response rates in patients with metastatic melanoma, and indeed may increase some treatment-related toxicity</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="808"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Patients with primary cutaneous melanoma with a Breslow thickness &gt; or = 1.5 mm have only a 30% to 70% probability of survival after surgery, and no adjuvant therapy has so far improved this outcome. Since interferon alfa-2a (IFNalpha2a) exhibits antitumor activity in metastatic melanoma, we investigated whether adjuvant IFNalpha2a diminishes the occurrence of metastases and thus prolongs disease-free survival in melanoma patients after excision of the primary tumor. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective randomized study, 311 melanoma patients with a Breslow thickness &gt; or = 1.5 mm were assigned to either adjuvant IFNalpha2a treatment (n = 154) or observation (n = 157) after excision of the primary tumor. IFNalpha2a was given daily at a dose of 3 mIU subcutaneously (s.c.) for 3 weeks (induction phase), after which a dose of 3 mIU s.c. three times per week was given over 1 year (maintenance phase). RESULTS: Prolonged disease-free survival was observed in patients treated with IFNalpha2a versus those who underwent surgery alone. This difference was significant (P = .02) for all patients enrolled onto the study (intention-to-treat analysis) at a mean observation time of 41 months. Subgroup analysis showed that Breslow tumor thickness had no influence on treatment results in the groups of patients investigated.

A phase III international study was designed to evaluate whether prophylactic isolated limb perfusion (ILP) could prevent regional recurrence and influence survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 832 assessable patients from 16 centers entered the study; 412 were randomized to wide excision (WE) only and 420 to WE plus ILP with melphalan and mild hyperthermia. Median age was 50 years, 68% of patients were female, 79% of melanomas were located on a lower limb, and 47% had a thickness &gt; or = 3 mm. RESULTS: Median follow-up duration is 6.4 years. There was a trend for a longer disease-free interval (DFI) after ILP. The difference was significant for patients who did not undergo elective lymph node dissection (ELND). The impact of ILP was clearly on the occurrence-as first site of progression - of in-transit metastases (ITM), which were reduced from 6.6% to 3.3%, and of regional lymph node (RLN) metastases, with a reduction from 16.7% to 12.6%. There was no benefit from ILP in terms of time to distant metastasis or survival. Side effects were higher after ILP, but transient in most patients. There were two amputations for limb toxicity after ILP.

Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of immediate node dissection in patients with melanoma of the trunk and without clinical evidence of regional node and distant metastases. METHODS: An international multicentre randomised trial was carried out by the WHO Melanoma Programme from 1982 to 1989. The trial included only patients with a trunk melanoma 1.5 mm or more in thickness. After wide excision of primary melanoma, patients were randomised to either immediate regional node dissection or a regional node dissection delayed until appearance of regional-node metastases. FINDINGS: Of the 252 patients entered, 240 (95%) were eligible and evaluable for analysis. 122 of these were randomised to immediate node dissection. 5-year survival observed in patients who had delayed node dissection was 51.3% (95% CI 41.7-60.1) compared with 61.7% (52.0-70.1) of patients who had immediate node dissection (p=0.09). 5-year survival rate in patients with occult regional node metastases was 48.2% (28.0-65.8) and 26.6% (13.4-41.8, p=0.04) in patients in whom the regional node dissection was delayed until the time of appearance of regional node metastases. Multivariate analysis showed that routine use of immediate node dissection had no impact on survival (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.5-1.02), whilst the status of regional nodes affected survival significantly (p=0.007). The patients with regional nodes that became clinically and histologically positive during follow-up had the poorest prognosis.

The aim of this randomized trial was to assess the activity of 5-fluorouracil versus etoposide when combined with epirubicin plus cisplatin in patients with advanced gastric carcinoma (AGC). METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, multicenter Phase III study, previously untreated patients with histopathologically proven AGC enrolled after giving informed consent. Patients were allocated to receive either EEP (etoposide 120 mg/m2, epirubicin 30 mg/m2, and cisplatin 40 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8) or FEP (5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2, epirubicin 60 mg/m2, and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on Day 1), and the regimens were to be repeated every fourth week. RESULTS: Of a total of 131 eligible patients, 64 were in the EEP group and 67 were in the FEP group. The objective response (complete + partial) rates for evaluable patients (n = 118) were comparable (P = 0.63) in the EEP (20.3%, 12/59) and FEP (15.3%, 9/59) groups, respectively.

This randomized trial sought to determine whether a large volume of chemotherapy solution used perioperatively to flood the peritoneal cavity could eliminate microscopic residual disease and thereby improve survival of patients with gastric cancer. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Surgical treatment failures in patients with gastric cancer are confined to the abdomen in most patients. Resection site and peritoneal surface spread, along with liver metastases, are the most common areas of recurrence. Survival and quality of life of patients with gastric cancer would be improved if disease progression at these anatomic sites was reduced. METHODS: In a prospective randomized trial of 248 patients, intraperitoneal mitomycin C on day 1 and intraperitoneal 5-fluorouracil on days 2 through 5 were administered after gastric cancer resection. Patients who were thought to have stage II or stage III disease were randomized after resection to surgery alone versus surgery plus early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy. After final pathologic examinations, there were 39 patients with stage I, 50 with stage II 95 with stage III, and 64 with resected stage IV cancer. RESULTS: The 5-year survival of the surgery-only group was 29.3%, and the surgery-plus-intraperitoneal chemotherapy group was 38.7% (p = 0.219). In a subset analysis, the patients with stage I, stage II, and stage IV disease showed no statistically significant difference in survival. The 5-year survival rate of patients with stage III disease who underwent surgery only was 18.4% versus a survival rate of 49.1% for patients who underwent surgery plus intraperitoneal chemotherapy (p = 0.011).

In patients who have breast cancer and metastatic bone disease, the bisphosphonate clodronate (clodronic acid) reduces the frequency of skeletal complications. Experiments in animals and preliminary clinical observations indicate that early clodronate therapy reduces the incidence of new bony metastases in breast cancer. We investigated the effects of clodronate on the incidence and extent of new metastases in patients with breast cancer. METHODS: Between 1990 and 1995, 302 patients with primary breast cancer and tumor cells in the bone marrow (the presence of which is a risk factor for the development of distant metastases) were randomly assigned to receive clodronate at a dose of 1600 mg per day orally for two years (157 patients) or standard follow-up (145 patients). The median length of observation was 36 months. All patients in both groups received standard surgical treatment and customary hormonal therapy or chemotherapy. RESULTS: Distant metastases were detected in 21 patients in the clodronate group and in 42 patients in the control group (P&lt;0.001). The incidence of both osseous and visceral metastases was significantly lower in the clodronate group than in the control group (P=0.003 for both osseous and visceral metastases). Six patients in the clodronate group died, as did 22 in the control group (P=0.001). The mean number of bony metastases per patient in the clodronate group was roughly half that in the control group (3.1 vs. 6.3).

METHODOLOGY: The patients were assigned to combination chemotherapy consisting of concomitant 5-fluorouracil 200 mg/m2, doxorubicin 15 mg/m2, and mitomycin 5 mg/m2 by intravenous administration. This combination chemotherapy was given concurrently as the initial dose within 1 week after palliative operation, and this regimen was repeated for at least 2 whole courses at 4-week intervals before the next course of therapy. Forty-two cases of this combination chemotherapy group and 41 of the control group were completely eligible for analysis. RESULTS: Regarding the overall 50% inhibition of tumor progression and that of gallbladder carcinoma, there were significantly better outcomes in the modified FAM therapy group. In this group, tumor reduction was achieved in 1 complete response (CR) and 2 partial response (PR) patients. With respect to the overall and differentiated survival times according to the tumor sites and the clinical efficacy, there was no difference between the groups. The most frequent adverse reactions were gastrointestinal manifestations such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; also noted was alopecia. CONCLUSIONS: Since this combination chemotherapy inhibited the tumor progression for significantly longer duration and, to a lesser extent, reduced the tumor size in non-resectable gallbladder carcinomas compared to a non-administrated chemotherapy group, this study will function as the basis for pursuing a more effective chemotherapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1044"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND/AIMS: In an attempt to improve treatment protocols for advanced pancreatic cancer, the value of regional chemotherapy compared with systemic chemotherapy was investigated in this randomized study.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The usefulness of performing an extended lymphadenectomy and retroperitoneal soft-tissue clearance in conjunction with a pancreatoduodenal resection in the treatment of ductal adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas is still unknown. Published studies suggest a benefit for the procedure in terms of better long-term survival rates; however, these studies were retrospective or did not prospectively evaluate large series of patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-one patients undergoing a pancreatoduodenal resection for a potentially curable ductal adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas were randomized to a standard (n = 40) or extended (n = 41) lymphadenectomy and retroperitoneal soft-tissue clearance in a prospective, multicentric study. The standard lymphadenectomy included removal of the anterior and posterior pancreatoduodenal, pyloric, and biliary duct, superior and inferior pancreatic head, and body lymph node stations. In addition to the above, the extended lymphadenectomy included removal of lymph nodes from the hepatic hilum and along the aorta from the diaphragmatic hiatus to the inferior mesenteric artery and laterally to both renal hila, with circumferential clearance of the origin of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery. Patients did not receive any postoperative adjuvant therapy. RESULTS: Demographic (age, gender) and histopathologic (tumor size, stage, differentiation, oncologic clearance) characteristics were similar in the two patient groups. Performance of the extended lymphadenectomy added time to the procedure, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (397 +/- 50 minutes vs. 372 +/- 50 minutes, p &gt; 0.05). Transfusion requirements, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates, and overall survival did not differ between the two groups. When subgroups of patients were analyzed, using an a posteriori analysis that was not planned at the time of study design, there was a significantly (p &lt; 0.05) longer survival rate in node positive patients after an extended rather than a standard lymphadenectomy. The survival curve of node positive patients after an extended lymphadenectomy could be superimposed onto the curves of node negative patients. Survival curves in node negative patients did not differ according to the magnitude of the lymphadenectomy. Multivariate analysis of all patients showed that long-term survival was affected by tumor differentiation (well vs. moderately vs. poorly differentiated, p &gt; 0.001), diameter (&lt; or = 2.0 cm. vs. &gt; 2.0 cm., p &lt; 0.01), lymph node metastasis (absent vs. present, p &lt; 0.01) and need for 4 or more units of transfused blood (&lt; 4 vs. &gt; or = 4, p &lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of an extended lymphadenectomy and retroperitoneal soft-tissue clearance to a pancreatoduodenal resection does not significantly increase morbidity and mortality rates. Although the overall survival rate does not differ in the two groups, there appears to be a trend toward longer survival in node positive patients treated with an extended rather than a standard lymphadenectomy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1046"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND/AIMS: The effects on early and late results of combined pancreatic resection with neo- and adjuvant immuno-chemotherapy for patients undergoing pancreatic resection are prospectively evaluated. METHODOLOGY: A group of 26 patients was divided into two groups, which were matched in terms of age-sex ratio, stage of disease, histological diagnosis and mode of pancreatic resection. Group A patients received a multimodality therapy, combining pancreatic resection with neo- and adjuvant locoregional targeting immunochemotherapy. Group B received pancreatic surgery only. RESULTS: For Group A patients (n = 14pts), a complete response was seen in 11 patients with a time interval ranging from 9 to 29 months. In the remaining 3 patients liver secondaries developed 12 months after pancreatic resection in 2 patients and the other patient developed pulmonary metastases 22 months after pancreatic resection. All patients (n = 3pts) are alive, but continue to have the disease. For Group B patients (n = 12pts), a complete response was seen in 3 patients with a survival of 9, 10 and 20 months following pancreatic resection. Six patients died due to locoregional recurrence of the disease, with the survival rate ranging from 7 to 18 months (mean 10 months). Locoregional recurrence was complicated with liver secondaries (n = 3) and with peritoneal dissemination of the disease in a further 3 patients. The remaining 3 patients are alive, but continue to have the disease due to locoregional recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Patients in whom neo- and adjuvant locoregional immunochemotherapy was carried out in conjunction with pancreatic resection, demonstrated a significantly higher response rate to treatment. Therefore the data collected offers clear evidence, regarding the usefulness, applicability and safety of combined neo- and adjuvant therapy with pancreatic resection. A Multi-modality approach is therefore highly recommended</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1047"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVES: To assess whether flutamide (Drogenil), a pure androgen receptor blocking agent, improves survival in patients with pancreatic carcinoma and thus whether testosterone is a major growth factor for this tumour. DESIGN: A prospective, randomised, double blind placebo controlled trial. SUBJECTS: 49 patients with a clinical diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma. INTERVENTIONS: 24 patients received flutamide and 25 received placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Death of the patient. RESULTS: Analysis of all patients at 6 months and 1 year showed 14 and eight patients alive, respectively, in the flutamide group compared with 10 and one in the placebo group. After exclusion of those patients in both groups who received less than 6 weeks&apos; treatment because of advanced disease and early death the comparable results were 14 (88%) and eight (50%) alive in the flutamide group compared with 10 (50%) and one (5%) in the placebo group. Median survival for all patients was 8 months in the flutamide group compared with 4 months in the placebo group. With the 6 week exclusions median survival was 12 months compared with 5 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the concept that testosterone is a growth factor for pancreatic carcinoma and that blockade of androgen receptors offers an appropriate new approach to treatment</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1065"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: A prospective, multiinstitutional trial was initiated in 1991 to examine the tolerance to and efficacy of a program of preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CTRT) and surgical resection for patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty- three patients were assessable for analysis, with a median follow-up of 52 months for survivors. Radiation therapy (RT) totaling 5,040 cGy in 180 cGy fractions with mitomycin 10 mg/m2 day 2 and fluorouracil (5-FU) 1,000 mg/m2/d continuous infusion days 2 through 5 and 29 through 32 were given as preoperative adjuvant therapy. Twelve patients did not proceed to surgery (one death, one toxicity, three local progression, six distant metastases, one intercurrent illness), whereas 41 patients underwent surgery. Of these, 17 patients did not have resection (11, hepatic and/or peritoneal metastases and six local extension that precluded resection). Twenty-four patients had tumor resection (19 Whipple, four total pancreatectomy, one distal pancreatectomy). RESULTS: Treatment toxicity was primarily hematologic, although a comparable number suffered biliary tract complications, either from obstruction or cholangitis as a result of an occluded stent or the primary tumor. There was one postoperative death. Median survival for the entire group and for the 24 patients with resection was 9.7 and 15.7 months. This survival rate reflected the advanced state of most resected cancers (positive peritoneal cytology, three patients; margins within 2 mm, 13 patients; involved lymph nodes, four patients; and need for superior mesenteric vein (SMV) resection, four patients). Tumor progression was most frequent at metastatic sites. CONCLUSION: This preoperative CTRT protocol was feasible and safe in a cooperative group setting. Entry of patients with advanced tumors probably accounted for the suboptimal resectability and survival results</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1066"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To evaluate the toxicities, radiographic and pathologic responses, and event-free outcomes with combined modality treatment that involves preoperative rapid-fractionation chemoradiation, pancreaticoduodenectomy, and electron-beam intraoperative radiation therapy (EB-IORT) for patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with radiographically resectable localized adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head were entered onto a preoperative protocol that consisted of a 2-week course of fluorouracil (5-FU) 300 mg/m2 daily 5 days per week and concomitant rapid-fractionation radiation 30 Gy, 3 Gy daily 5 days per week. Radiographic restaging was performed 4 weeks after chemoradiation, and patients with localized disease underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with EB-IORT 10 to 15 Gy. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were entered onto the study and completed chemoradiation, 34 (97%) as outpatients. Three patients (9%) experienced grade 3 nausea and vomiting; no other grade 3 or 4 toxicities were observed. Of the 27 patients taken to surgery, 20 patients (74%) underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with EB-IORT. All patients had a less than grade III pathologic response to preoperative chemoradiation. At a median follow-up of 37 months, the 3-year survival rate in patients who underwent combined modality therapy was 23%. CONCLUSION: Combined modality treatment with preoperative rapid- fractionation chemoradiation, pancreaticoduodenectomy, and EB-IORT is associated with minimal toxicity and excellent locoregional control. This represents one approach to maximize the proportion of patients who receive all components of combined modality therapy and avoids the toxicity of pancreaticoduodenectomy in patients found to have metastatic disease at the time of restaging</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1103"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen, a drug with antioestrogenic effects, is predicted to prevent the occurrence of breast cancer. We have undertaken a trial of tamoxifen in healthy women who are at increased risk of breast cancer because of family history. We report a planned interim analysis. METHODS: Between October, 1986, and April, 1996, we accrued 2494 healthy women aged between 30 and 70 with a family history of breast cancer. They have been randomised (double blind) to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day orally or placebo for up to 8 years. Follow-up included clinical assessment, annual mammography, and assessment of toxicity and compliance. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of breast cancer, which was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis with a survival curve. FINDINGS: With a median follow-up of 70 months, 2471 women (tamoxifen 1238, placebo 1233) were suitable for analysis. The groups were evenly matched at baseline, and compliance was good. The overall frequency of breast cancer is the same for women on tamoxifen or placebo (tamoxifen 34, placebo 36, relative risk 1.06 [95% CI 0.7- 1.7], p=0.8). Participants who were already on hormone-replacement therapy when they entered the study had an increased risk of breast cancer compared with non-users. Those participants who started such therapy while on trial had a significantly reduced risk. The safety profile of tamoxifen was as expected. INTERPRETATION: We have been unable to show any effect of tamoxifen on breast-cancer incidence in healthy women, contrary to the report from the NSABP-P1 study showing a 45% reduction in healthy women given tamoxifen versus placebo. Differences in the study populations for the two trials may underlie these conflicting findings: eligibility in our trial was based predominantly on a strong family history of breast cancer whereas in the NSABP trial was mostly based on non-genetic risk factors. The importance of oestrogen promotion may vary between such populations</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1106"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen is a candidate chemopreventive agent in breast cancer, although the drug may be associated with the development of endometrial cancer. Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive. METHODS: In October, 1992, we started a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomised trial of tamoxifen in women (mainly in Italy) who did not have breast cancer and who had had a hysterectomy. Women were randomised to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day or placebo, both orally for 5 years. The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years&apos; follow-up. In June, 1997, the trialists and the data-monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study. Recruitment ended on July 11, 1997, and the study will continue as planned. The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from breast cancer. This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention-to-treat. FINDINGS: 5408 women were randomised; participating women have a median follow-up of 46 months for major endpoints. 41 cases of breast cancer occurred so far; there have been no deaths from breast cancer. There is no difference in breast-cancer frequency between the placebo (22 cases) and tamoxifen (19) arms. There is a statistically significant reduction of breast cancer among women receiving tamoxifen who also used hormone-replacement therapy during the trial: among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo, we found eight cases of breast cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen. Compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of vascular events and hypertriglyceridaemia among women on tamoxifen. INTERPRETATION: Although this preliminary analysis has low power, in this cohort of women at low-to-normal risk of breast cancer, the postulated protective effects of tamoxifen are not yet apparent. Women using hormone- replacement therapy appear to have benefited from use of tamoxifen. There were no deaths from breast cancer recorded in women in the study. It is essential to continue follow-up to quantify the long-term risks and benefits of tamoxifen therapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1114"><COL><DATA> Between August 1990 and January 1992, 184 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, FIGO stage II B IV A were randomised (study 1) to receive either two cycles of bleomycin, ifosfamide-mesna and cisplatin (BIP) chemotherapy (CT) followed by radiotherapy (RT) &apos;CT-RT Group&apos; n = 94 or RT alone, RT Group n = 90. In the &apos;CT-RT Group&apos;, of evaluable 89 patients, 64 responded: complete response (CR) four (4.5%) and partial response (PR) 60 (67.5%). Of the remaining 25 patients 23 had stable disease and two progressed. Eighty of 89 patients completed RT as planned. Following RT 56 (70%) achieved CR, 19 (23.7%) had residual disease and five (6.3%) had progressed. Patients aged &gt; 45 and those with Hb &gt; 10 gm/dL had significantly better response to CT. Further, CT responders had a better response to RT; 83% (49/59) vs 33.3% (seven/21), p &lt; 0.01. In the &apos;RT Group&apos; 88 patients were evaluable; 61 (69.3%) patients achieved CR, 25 had residual disease and two progressed. The estimated overall survival at 48 months in the &apos;CT-RT Group&apos; and the &apos;RT Group&apos; is 38% +2.01 (SE) and 36% +1.85 (SE), p = 0.59 respectively. In a subsequent randomised study (study 2) 36 patients with stage III B cervical cancer received three cycles of BIP (as above) followed by RT vs 36 patients who received RT alone. In the &apos;CT-RT Group&apos; 29 patients responded; CR-8 (22.2%), PR-21 (58.3%). Six patients had no response to CT and one patient died of CT toxicity. Following RT-24 of 35 (68-6%) patients achieved CR, eight had residual disease and three patients progressed while on RT. In the &apos;RT Group&apos;-21 of 36 (58.4%) achieved CR, 12 had residual disease and three progressed. Estimated survival was 71% in the &apos;CT-RT Group&apos; and 69% in the &apos;RT Group&apos;, p = ns. Nausea/vomiting, alopecia, grade I-II myelosuppression, diarrhoea and mucositis were the major side effects of CT. Three patients died of CT toxicity-two in study 1 and one in study 2. Cystitis, proctitis and local skin reaction after RT occurred equally in the two groups in both the studies. BIP CT prior to RT in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer results in a high response rate. Response to CT predicts response to RT. There is no increase in the toxicity to subsequent RT. Our studies have failed to demonstrate any significant difference in overall and disease-free survival when neoadjuvant CT is added prior to the standard RT regimen</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1115"><COL><DATA> The objective of this study was to determine whether the addition of concurrent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and/or a change in radiation fractionation improves pelvic control and survival or decreases complications in advanced cervical cancer, FIGO stages IB/IIA (&gt;=5 cm) to IVA inclusive. After stratification by pelvic disease extent, 234 of a planned 292 patients were randomized to receive one of four possible treatments: (a) standard external beam pelvic irradiation (RT) 5000 cGy in 25 fractions versus (b) RT as in arm (a) with infusional IV 5-FU 1g/m2 daily in the first and last 4 days of RT, (c) partially hyperfractionated RT, 5280 cGy in 33 fractions, two fractions per day on the first and last 4 days of RT, or (d) arm (c) with the same FU. All were followed with a linear source of intracavitary RT to deliver 40 Gy. The median duration of follow-up for the 221 evaluable patients was 59 months. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier disease-free survival (DFS) in arm (a), (c), (d), and (b), respectively, were 45, 53, 58, and 61%. The differences in survival and pelvic control were not statistically significant. An exploratory subset analysis was performed within stratum 1 and stratum 2 to generate hypotheses for future studies. Only for the 99 patients in stratum 1 (IB/IIA or medial parametrial IIB disease) was the 5-year DFS significantly better (long rank P = 0.05) for standard RT and 5-FU. The DFS was 39% for arm (a), 76% for arm (b), 58% for arm (c), and 65% for arm (d). A multivariate analysis of patient, tumor, and treatment related prognostic factors identified only the use of 5-FU to account for the observed difference. The crude serious late bowel or bladder complication rate was 5.9%. Overall concurrent infusional 5-FU was not beneficial when added to standard RT in this study. The possible benefit for patients in stratum 1 requires exploration in a further randomized trial with appropriate accrual.

This report extends those findings. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women (N = 818) with localized DCIS were randomly assigned to lumpectomy or lumpectomy plus radiation (50 Gy). Tissue was removed so that resected specimen margins were histologically tumor-free. Mean follow-up time was 90 months (range, 67 to 130). Size and method of tumor detection were determined by central clinical, mammographic, and pathologic assessment. Life-table estimates of event-free survival and survival, average annual rates of occurrence for specific events, relative risks for event-specific end points, and cumulative probability of specific events comprising event-free survival are presented. RESULTS: The benefit of lumpectomy plus radiation was virtually unchanged between 5 and 8 years of follow-up and was due to a reduction in invasive and noninvasive ipsilateral breast tumors (IBTs). Incidence of locoregional and distant events remained similar in both treatment groups; deaths were only infrequently related to breast cancer. Incidence of noninvasive IBT was reduced from 13.4% to 8.2% (P = .007), and of invasive IBT, from 13.4% to 3.9% (P &lt; .0001). All cohorts benefited from radiation regardless of clinical or mammographic tumor characteristics. CONCLUSION: Through 8 years of follow-up, our findings continue to indicate that lumpectomy plus radiation is more beneficial than lumpectomy alone for women with localized, mammographically detected DCIS. When evaluated according to the mammographic characteristics of their DCIS, all groups benefited from radiation</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1175"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: There have been many randomised trials of adjuvant prolonged polychemotherapy among women with early breast cancer, and an updated overview of their results is presented. METHODS: In 1995, information was sought on each woman in any randomised trial that began before 1990 and involved treatment groups that differed only with respect to the chemotherapy regimens that were being compared. Analyses involved about 18,000 women in 47 trials of prolonged polychemotherapy versus no chemotherapy, about 6000 in 11 trials of longer versus shorter polychemotherapy, and about 6000 in 11 trials of anthracycline- containing regimens versus CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil). FINDINGS: For recurrence, polychemotherapy produced substantial and highly significant proportional reductions both among women aged under 50 at randomisation (35% [SD 4] reduction; 2p&lt;0.00001) and among those aged 50-69 (20% [SD 3] reduction; 2p&lt;0.00001); few women aged 70 or over had been studied. For mortality, the reductions were also significant both among women aged under 50 (27% [SD 5] reduction; 2p&lt;0.00001) and among those aged 50-69 (11% [SD 3] reduction; 2p=0.0001). The recurrence reductions emerged chiefly during the first 5 years of follow-up, whereas the difference in survival grew throughout the first 10 years. After standardisation for age and time since randomisation, the proportional reductions in risk were similar for women with node-negative and node-positive disease. Applying the proportional mortality reduction observed in all women aged under 50 at randomisation would typically change a 10-year survival of 71% for those with node-negative disease to 78% (an absolute benefit of 7%), and of 42% for those with node-positive disease to 53% (an absolute benefit of 11%). The smaller proportional mortality reduction observed in all women aged 50-69 at randomisation would translate into smaller absolute benefits, changing a 10-year survival of 67% for those with node-negative disease to 69% (an absolute gain of 2%) and of 46% for those with node-positive disease to 49% (an absolute gain of 3%). The age-specific benefits of polychemotherapy appeared to be largely irrespective of menopausal status at presentation, oestrogen receptor status of the primary tumour, and of whether adjuvant tamoxifen had been given. In terms of other outcomes, there was a reduction of about one-fifth (2p=0.05) in contralateral breast cancer, which has already been included in the analyses of recurrence, and no apparent adverse effect on deaths from causes other than breast cancer (death rate ratio 0.89 [SD 0.09]). The directly randomised comparisons of longer versus shorter durations of polychemotherapy did not indicate any survival advantage with the use of more than about 3-6 months of polychemotherapy. By contrast, directly randomised comparisons did suggest that, compared with CMF alone, the anthracycline-containing regimens studied produced somewhat greater effects on recurrence (2p=0.006) and mortality (69% vs 72% 5-year survival; log-rank 2p=0.02). But this comparison is one of many that could have been selected for emphasis, the 99% CI reaches zero, and the results of several of the relevant trials are not yet available. INTERPRETATION: Some months of adjuvant polychemotherapy (eg, with CMF or an anthracycline-containing regimen) typically produces an absolute improvement of about 7-11% in 10-year survival for women aged under 50 at presentation with early breast cancer, and of about 2-3% for those aged 50-69 (unless their prognosis is likely to be extremely good even without such treatment). Treatment decisions involve consideration not only of improvements in cancer recurrence and survival but also of adverse side-effects of treatment, and this report makes no recommendations as to who should or should not be treated</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1179"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: In phase II studies, irinotecan is active in metastatic colorectal cancer, but the overall benefit has not been assessed in a randomised clinical trial. METHODS: Patients with proven metastatic colorectal cancer, which had progressed within 6 months of treatment with fluorouracil, were randomly assigned either 300-350 mg/m2 irinotecan every 3 weeks with supportive care or supportive care alone, in a 2:1 ratio. FINDINGS: 189 patients were allocated irinotecan and supportive care and 90 supportive care alone. The mean age of the participants was 58.8 years; 181 (65%) were men and 98 (35%) were women. WHO performance status was 0 in 79 (42%) patients, 1 in 77 (41%) patients, and 2 in 32 (17%) patients. Tumour-related symptoms were present in 134 (71%) patients and weight loss of more than 5% was seen in 15 (8%) patients. With a median follow-up of 13 months, the overall survival was significantly better in the irinotecan group (p=0.0001), with 36.2% 1-year survival in the irinotecan group versus 13.8% in the supportive-care group. The survival benefit, adjusted for prognostic factors in a multivariate analysis, remained significant (p=0.001). Survival without performance-status deterioration (p=0.0001), without weight loss of more than 5% (p=0.018), and pain-free survival (p=0.003) were significantly better in the patients given irinotecan. In a quality-of-life analysis, all significant differences, except on diarrhoea score, were in favour of the irinotecan group. INTERPRETATION: Our study shows that despite the side-effects of treatment, patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer, and for whom fluorouracil has failed, have a longer survival, fewer tumour-related symptoms, and a better quality of life when treated with irinotecan than with supportive care alone</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1182"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: In phase II trials, irinotecan is active in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, but the survival and clinical benefit of irinotecan compared with second-line fluorouracil by continuous infusion is not known. METHODS: 267 patients who had failed to respond to first-line fluorouracil, or whose disease had progressed after treatment with first-line fluorouracil were randomly allocated irinotecan 300-350 mg/m2 infused once every 3 weeks or fluorouracil by continuous infusion. Treatment was given until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or the patient refused to continue treatment. The primary endpoint was survival, while progression-free survival, response rate, symptom-free survival, adverse events, and quality of life (QoL) were secondary endpoints. FINDINGS: 133 patients were randomly allocated irinotecan and 134 were allocated fluorouracil by continuous infusion. Patients treated with irinotecan lived for significantly longer than patients on fluorouracil (p=0.035). Survival at 1 year was increased from 32% in the fluorouracil group to 45% in the irinotecan group. Median survival was 10.8 months in the irinotecan group and 8.5 months in the fluorouracil group. Median progression-free survival was longer with irinotecan (4.2 vs 2.9 months for irinotecan vs fluorouracil, respectively; p=0.030). The median pain-free survival was 10.3 months and 8.5 months (p=0.06) for irinotecan and fluorouracil, respectively. Both treatments were equally well tolerated. QoL was similar in both groups.

METHODS: In 1995, information was sought on each woman in any randomised trial that began before 1990 of adjuvant tamoxifen versus no tamoxifen before recurrence. Information was obtained and analysed centrally on each of 37000 women in 55 such trials, comprising about 87% of the worldwide evidence. Compared with the previous such overview, this approximately doubles the amount of evidence from trials of about 5 years of tamoxifen and, taking all trials together, on events occurring more than 5 years after randomisation. FINDINGS: Nearly 8000 of the women had a low, or zero, level of the oestrogen-receptor protein (ER) measured in their primary tumour. Among them, the overall effects of tamoxifen appeared to be small, and subsequent analyses of recurrence and total mortality are restricted to the remaining women (18000 with ER-positive tumours, plus nearly 12000 more with untested tumours, of which an estimated 8000 would have been ER-positive). For trials of 1 year, 2 years, and about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, the proportional recurrence reductions produced among these 30000 women during about 10 years of follow-up were 21% (SD 3), 29% (SD 2), and 47% (SD 3), respectively, with a highly significant trend towards greater effect with longer treatment (chi2(1)=52.0, 2p&lt;0.00001). The corresponding proportional mortality reductions were 12% (SD 3), 17% (SD 3), and 26% (SD 4), respectively, and again the test for trend was significant (chi2(1) = 8.8, 2p=0.003). The absolute improvement in recurrence was greater during the first 5 years, whereas the improvement in survival grew steadily larger throughout the first 10 years. The proportional mortality reductions were similar for women with node-positive and node-negative disease, but the absolute mortality reductions were greater in node-positive women. In the trials of about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen the absolute improvements in 10-year survival were 10.9% (SD 2.5) for node- positive (61.4% vs 50.5% survival, 2p&lt;0.00001) and 5.6% (SD 1.3) for node-negative (78.9% vs 73.3% survival, 2p&lt;0.00001). These benefits appeared to be largely irrespective of age, menopausal status, daily tamoxifen dose (which was generally 20 mg), and of whether chemotherapy had been given to both groups. In terms of other outcomes among all women studied (ie, including those with &quot;ER-poor&quot; tumours), the proportional reductions in contralateral breast cancer were 13% (SD 13), 26% (SD 9), and 47% (SD 9) in the trials of 1, 2, or about 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. The incidence of endometrial cancer was approximately doubled in trials of 1 or 2 years of tamoxifen and approximately quadrupled in trials of 5 years of tamoxifen (although the number of cases was small and these ratios were not significantly different from each other). The absolute decrease in contralateral breast cancer was about twice as large as the absolute increase in the incidence of endometrial cancer. Tamoxifen had no apparent effect on the incidence of colorectal cancer or, after exclusion of deaths from breast or endometrial cancer, on any of the other main categories of cause of death (total nearly 2000 such deaths; overall relative risk 0.99 [SD 0.05]). INTERPRETATION: For women with tumours that have been reliably shown to be ER-negative, adjuvant tamoxifen remains a matter for research. However, some years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment substantially improves the 10-year survival of women with ER-positive tumours and of women whose tumours are of unknown ER status, with the proportional reductions in breast cancer recurrence and in mortality appearing to be largely unaffected by other patient characteristics or treatments</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="9"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To investigate whether dose escalation of megestrol acetate (MA) improves response rate and survival in comparison with standard doses of MA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred sixty-eight patients with metastatic breast cancer, positive and/or unknown estrogen and progesterone receptors, zero or one prior trial of hormonal therapy, and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were prospectively randomized into three groups. The groups of patients received either MA 160 mg/d (one tablet per day), MA 800 mg/d (five tablets per day), or MA 1,600 mg/d (10 tablets per day). RESULTS: Patient characteristics were well balanced in the three treatment groups. Three hundred sixty-six patients received treatment and were included in the analyses. The response rates were 23%, 27%, and 27% for the 160-mg, 800-mg, and 1,600-mg arms, respectively. Response duration correlated inversely with dose. Median durations of response were 17 months, 14 months, and 8 months for the 160-mg, 800-mg, and 1,600-mg arms, respectively. No significant differences in the treatment arms were noted for time to disease progression or for survival; survival medians were 28 months (low dose), 24 months (mid dose) and 29 months (high dose). The most frequent and troublesome toxicity, weight gain, was dose-related, with approximately 20% of patients on the two higher-dose arms reporting weight gain of more than 20% of their prestudy weight, compared with only 2% in the 160-mg dose arm. CONCLUSION: With a median follow-up of 8 years, these results demonstrate no advantage for dose escalation of MA in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="10"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To define the correct time to remove the drain after axillary dissection for carcinoma of the breast. DESIGN: Prospective randomised trial. SETTING: Two public hospitals, Israel. SUBJECTS: 90 women who required axillary dissection for carcinoma of the breast. INTERVENTIONS: 42 were randomised to have the drain removed on postoperative day 3, and 48 to keep the drain in until discharge had decreased to less than 35 ml/24 hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Formation of seromas or wound infections, need to reinsert the drain, and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS: Early removal of the axillary drain was associated with a significantly higher incidence of seromas (9/42 compared with 2/48, p = 0.02) unless the total amount of fluid drained during the first three postoperative days was less than 250 ml. CONCLUSION: Drains should be removed after axillary dissection only when the daily amount of fluid discharged is low, unless the drainage during the first three days is less than 250 ml</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="11"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: This phase III study compared docetaxel with mitomycin plus vinblastine (MV) in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) progressing despite previous anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n=392) were randomized to receive either docetaxel 100 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) every 3 weeks (n=203) or mitomycin 12 mg/m2 i.v. every 6 weeks plus vinblastine 6 mg/m2 i.v. every 3 weeks (n=189), for a maximum of 10 3-week cycles. RESULTS: In an intention-to-treat analysis, docetaxel produced significantly higher response rates than MV overall (30.0% v 11.6%; P &lt; .0001), as well as in patients with visceral involvement (30% v 11%), liver metastases (33% v 7%), or resistance to previous anthracycline agents (30% v 7%). Median time to progression (TTP) and overall survival were significantly longer with docetaxel than MV (19 v 1 weeks, P=.001, and 1 1.4 v 8.7 months, P=.0097, respectively). Neutropenia grade 3/4 was more frequent with docetaxel (93.1 % v62.5%; P &lt; .05); thrombocytopenia grade 3/4 was more frequent with MV (12.0% v 4.1%; P &lt; .05). Severe acute or chronic nonhematologic adverse events were infrequent in both groups. Withdrawal rates because of adverse events (MV, 10.1%; docetaxel, 13.8%) or toxic death (MV, 1.6%; docetaxel, 2.0%) were similar in both groups. Quality-of-life analysis was limited by a number of factors, but results were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: Docetaxel is significantly superior to MV in terms of response, TTP, and survival. The safety profiles of both therapies are manageable and tolerable. Docetaxel represents a clear treatment option for patients with MBC progressing despite previous anthracycline-containing chemotherapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="12"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: A prospective, multicenter, randomized, Phase III trial comparing the efficacy of combination chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) with a combination of vinorelbine and doxorubicin (NA) in the treatment of patients with advanced breast carcinoma was undertaken. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-seven patients who previously were untreated for recurrent or metastatic breast carcinoma were entered into the study; 7 patients could not be assessed. The final analysis relates to 85 patients who were treated with FAC and 85 patients who were treated with NA, of whom 21 (25%) and 44 (52%), respectively, had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall response rates were similar for the two treatments and were unaffected by prior exposure to adjuvant therapy; overall response rate (ORR) for FAC was 74% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 65-83%), and the ORR for NA was 75% (95% CI, 66-84%). The activity of NA in patients with liver involvement was greater than that of FAC in terms of survival. Overall survivals were similar, with a median of 17.3 months for patients receiving FAC and 17.8 months for patients receiving NA. Severe toxicity was uncommon with World Health Organization Grade 3-4 neutropenia affecting only 7% of patients in each arm of the study. NA was associated with a higher incidence of mild to moderate constipation, neurotoxicity, and phlebitis, whereas FAC produced a slight excess of mild cardiotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of these two regimens is very similar, although NA may be more active in a subset of patients with visceral metastatic disease, particularly liver involvement. It is clear that, in a direct comparison with an established three-drug regimen, the newer two-drug combination of NA demonstrated equivalent activity with no significant excess of Grade 3-4 toxicity</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="71"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Postmastectomy radiotherapy is associated with a lower locoregional recurrence rate and improved disease-free and overall survival when combined with chemotherapy in premenopausal high-risk breast-cancer patients. However, whether the same benefits apply also in postmenopausal women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen for similar high-risk cancer is unclear. In a randomised trial among postmenopausal women who had undergone mastectomy, we compared adjuvant tamoxifen alone with tamoxifen plus postoperative radiotherapy. METHODS: Between 1982 and 1990, postmenopausal women with high-risk breast cancer (stage II or III) were randomly assigned adjuvant tamoxifen (30 mg daily for 1 year) alone (689) or with postoperative radiotherapy to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes (686). Median follow-up was 123 months. The endpoints were first site of recurrence (locoregional recurrence, distant metastases, or both), and disease-free and overall survival. FINDINGS: Locoregional recurrence occurred in 52 (8%) of the radiotherapy plus tamoxifen group and 242 (35%) of the tamoxifen only group (p&lt;0.001). In total there were 321 (47%) and 411 (60%) recurrences, respectively. Disease-free survival was 36% in the radiotherapy plus tamoxifen group and 24% in the tamoxifen alone group (p&lt;0.001). Overall survival was also higher in the radiotherapy group (385 vs 434 deaths; survival 45 vs 36% at 10 years, p=0.03). INTERPRETATION: Postoperative radiotherapy decreased the risk of locoregional recurrence and was associated with improved survival in high-risk postmenopausal breast-cancer patients after mastectomy and limited axillary dissection, with 1 year of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Improved survival in high-risk breast cancer can best be achieved by a strategy of both locoregional and systemic tumour control</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="72"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: We have shown previously that lumpectomy with radiation therapy was more effective than lumpectomy alone for the treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). We did a double-blind randomised controlled trial to find out whether lumpectomy, radiation therapy, and tamoxifen was of more benefit than lumpectomy and radiation therapy alone for DCIS. METHODS: 1804 women with DCIS, including those whose resected sample margins were involved with tumour, were randomly assigned lumpectomy, radiation therapy (50 Gy), and placebo (n=902), or lumpectomy, radiation therapy, and tamoxifen (20 mg daily for 5 years, n=902). Median follow-up was 74 months (range 57-93). We compared annual event rates and cumulative probability of invasive or non-invasive ipsilateral and contralateral tumours over 5 years. FINDINGS: Women in the tamoxifen group had fewer breast-cancer events at 5 years than did those on placebo (8.2 vs 13.4%, p=0.0009). The cumulative incidence of all invasive breast-cancer events in the tamoxifen group was 4.1% at 5 years: 2.1% in the ipsilateral breast, 1.8% in the contralateral breast, and 0.2% at regional or distant sites. The risk of ipsilateral-breast cancer was lower in the tamoxifen group even when sample margins contained tumour and when DCIS was associated with comedonecrosis.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with T1-3N0-1M0 disease were randomized to receive either paclitaxel (250 mg/m(2)) as 24-hour infusion or FAC in standard doses at every-3-week intervals. Each patient was treated with four cycles of preoperative chemotherapy. Clinical response and extent of residual disease in the breast and lymph nodes was assessed after four cycles of induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: A total of 174 patients were registered, and 87 were randomized to each arm of the study. Clinical response, ie, complete and partial responses, was similar in both arms of the study. Three patients in the FAC arm and one patient in the paclitaxel subgroup had progressive disease. The extent of residual disease by intent-to-treat analysis at the time of surgery was similar between the two arms of the study. CONCLUSION: The results of this prospective study demonstrated that single-agent paclitaxel as neoadjuvant therapy has significant antitumor activity, and this was clinically comparable to FAC. Similar fractions of patients had clinical complete and partial responses, and very few patients had no response to either therapy. The value of alternate non-cross-resistant therapies as used in this protocol on the clinical course of this disease would require longer follow-up</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="74"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: In 1989, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project initiated the B-22 trial to determine whether intensifying or intensifying and increasing the total dose of cyclophosphamide in a doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide combination would benefit women with primary breast cancer and positive axillary nodes. B-25 was initiated to determine whether further intensifying and increasing the cyclophosphamide dose would yield more favorable results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 2,548) were randomly assigned to three groups. The dose and intensity of doxorubicin were similar in all groups. Group 1 received four courses, ie, double the dose and intensity of cyclophosphamide given in the B-22 standard therapy group; group 2 received the same dose of cyclophosphamide as in group 1, administered in two courses (intensified); group 3 received double the dose of cyclophosphamide (intensified and increased) given in group 1. All patients received recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Life-table estimates were used to determine disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in DFS (P =.20), distant DFS (P =.31), or survival (P =.76) among the three groups. At 5 years, the DFS in groups 1 and 2 (61% v 64%, respectively; P =. 29) was similar to but slightly lower than that in group 3 (61% v 66%, respectively; P = 08). Survival in group 1 was concordant with that in groups 2 (78% v 77%, respectively; P =.71) and 3 (78% v 79%, respectively; P =.86). Grade 4 toxicity was 20%, 34%, and 49% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Severe infection and septic episodes increased in group 3. The decrease in the amount and intensity of cyclophosphamide and delays in therapy were greatest in courses 3 and 4 in group 3. The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia increased in all groups. CONCLUSION: Because intensifying and increasing cyclophosphamide two or four times that given in standard clinical practice did not substantively improve outcome, such therapy should be reserved for the clinical trial setting</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="75"><COL><DATA> The Italian Oncology Group for Clinical Research tested two experimental chemotherapy strategies in an attempt to improve the results achievable with conventional chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. One hundred sixty-two patients were randomly allocated as follows: (a) to the conventional cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy regimen (CMF); (b) to a rotational crossing program (ROT-CROSS); or (c) to a sequential intensification program (SEQ-INT). The same single agents (C, M, F, cisplatin, etoposide, and doxorubicin) were administered in both experimental arms, but following a different policy. The SEQ-INT program induced a significantly higher complete response (32% vs. 6%, p = 0.0006) and objective response rate (72% vs. 42%, p = 0.0047) than CMF did. There were no differences in survival between CMF and either experimental arm. A number of side effects were significantly more with both experimental chemotherapies than with CMF, but the treatments were generally tolerable. Although some caution is required when interpreting a significant advantage found between an entire chemotherapeutic strategy and a single conventional combination, this study documents the potential therapeutic advantage of administering different sequential chemotherapies, and changing each at the time of maximum result without waiting for a progression. The impressive cytoreductive effects achievable with this policy (SEQ-INT) in metastatic disease merit further investigation in the adjuvant setting</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="76"><COL><DATA> The effectiveness of combining mitomycin C (MMC), tamoxifen (TAM), and 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil (tegafur) was evident in patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers. UFT, an oral preparation of tegafur and uracil at a molar ratio of 1:4, was reported to have higher antitumor effects than tegafur alone for patients with breast cancer. Therefore, the combined chemotherapy of MMC, TAM and UFT may possibly be effective for breast cancer. From 1988 to 1991. we studied the effects of postoperative adjuvant therapy for Japanese women with stage 11 breast cancer, all seen at 71 institutions in western areas of Japan. Five hundred and ninety four patients with stage II primary breast cancer who had undergone curative surgery, including total mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection, were enrolled. On the day of surgery, each patient was given 13 mg/m2 of MMC intravenously. Patients with ER+ tumors were then assigned to group A or group B. Group A received 30 mg/day of TAM given orally from postoperative 2 weeks, for 2 years. Group B was additionally given an oral dose of 300 mg/day of UFT for 2 years, given concomitantly with 30 mg/day of TAM. Patients with ER- tumors were assigned to group C or group D. Group C were prescribed 300 mg/day of UFT, orally, from postoperative 2 weeks for 2 years, and group D were additionally given an oral dose of 30 mg/day of TAM together with 300 mg/day of UFT. There were no differences among the groups regarding prognostic factors or doses of MMC and TAM in ER+ patients and MMC and UFT in ER- patients. Toxicity rates for leukopenia, anorexia, and nausea/vomiting were higher in group B than in group A patients. There were no statistical differences in the overall survival and disease-free survival times between groups A and B, or groups C and D, for all eligible cases. In a retrospective subgroup analysis using Bonferroni&apos;s adjustments, the additional effect of UFT on the combined treatment of MMC and TAM lengthened the disease-free survival time for patients with premenopausal ER+ cancers (corrected P value by Bonferroni&apos;s adjustments &lt;0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that effects of the combined treatment of MMC, TAM, and UFT was significantly related to the menopausal status (P&lt;0.01).

METHODS: Nine pathologic features observed in a pathologic subset of 623 of 814 evaluable women enrolled in this randomized clinical trial were assessed for their role in the prediction of second ipsilateral breast tumors (IBT), other events, and selection of breast irradiation (XRT) following lumpectomy. RESULTS: The frequency of subsequent IBT was reduced from 31% to 13% (P = 0.0001) by XRT. The average annual hazard rates for IBT were reduced by XRT for all pathologic features examined. Four characteristics were individually noted to be significantly related to IBT, but only moderate-to-marked and absent-to-slight comedo necrosis were found to be independent high and low risk predictors, respectively, for such an event in patients of both treatment groups. XRT effected a 7% absolute reduction at 8 years in the low risk group. Despite a relatively high incidence (approximately 40%) of IBT consisting of invasive cancer, mortality due to breast carcinoma after DCIS for the entire cohort was found to be only 1.6% at 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: The degree of comedo necrosis in patients with DCIS appears to be sufficient for discriminating between high and low risks for IBT following lumpectomy for DCIS. Although margin status, unlike in our previous report, was found to have only a slight or borderline influence on the frequency of IBT at 8 years, excision of DCIS with free margins is advised. The low risk group exhibits a statistically significant reduction of IBT from XRT. The decision to forgo XRT in the treatment of this singular subset of patients would appear to depend on clinical considerations and the input of informed patients rather than being standard practice.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 365 women with measurable metastatic breast cancer, previously untreated with chemotherapy for their metastatic disease, were randomized to receive either immediate chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) or up to four cycles of one of five sequential cohorts of single-agent drugs: trimetrexate, melphalan, amonafide, carboplatin, or elsamitrucin, followed by CAF. RESULTS: The toxicity of each single agent followed by CAF was comparable to that of CAF alone. The cumulative response rates for the single agent followed by CAF were not statistically different from those of CAF alone (44% v 52%; P = .24). However, in the multivariate analysis, patients with visceral disease had a trend toward lower response rates on the phase II agent plus CAF arm (P = .078). Although survival and response duration also were not statistically significantly different between the two study arms (P = .074 and P = .069, respectively), there was a suggestion of benefit for the CAF-only arm. CONCLUSION: The brief use of a phase II agent, regardless of its efficacy, followed by CAF resulted in response rates, toxicities, durations of response, and survival statistically equivalent to those seen with the use of CAF alone. These findings support the use of a new paradigm for the evaluation of phase II agents in the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="79"><COL><DATA> The purpose of this randomized phase III trial was to study whether medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) maintenance treatment prolongs the time to progression in advanced breast cancer patients responding to an induction chemotherapy. Patients with progressive advanced breast cancer previously untreated with anthracylines and progestins were given epirubicin (30 mg/m2) and ifosfamide (2 g/m2) on days 1 and 8 at 3-weekly intervals. Patients without disease progression after 6 cycles of chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive, until progression, either no treatment or MPA at a daily total dose of 500 mg. Ninety patients were randomized: 46 to the MPA arm and 44 to the observation arm. Median time to progression was longer in the MPA arm: 4.9 months versus 3.7 months in the intent-to-treat analysis (p = 0.02), and 4.9 months versus 3.0 months in the secondary efficacy analysis (p = 0.012). Seven patients were removed from MPA due to side effects. The changes in patient-rated quality of life scores were similar in both groups. The median length of survival from randomization was 17.4 months for patients receiving MPA and 18.3 months for patients randomized to observation (p = 0.39). In conclusion, in patients with advanced breast cancer achieving remission or non-progression with 6 cycles of epirubicin and ifosfamide chemotherapy, MPA maintenance treatment led to a significant, though modest, prolongation of the time to progression without affecting overall survival of the study patients</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="142"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To compare the short and medium term result of hand-sewn and stapled anastomoses after oesophagectomy.

METHODS: Twenty-six patients were randomly allocated to either retrosternal (n = 14) or posterior mediastinal (n = 12) reconstruction after gastric tube formation. Radionuclide transit studies were applied to obtain objective functional data and a standardized quality-of-life assessment was performed. RESULTS: Retrosternal reconstruction showed an increased morbidity (15 vs 13 major complications) and mortality (14.2 vs 8.3%). Radionuclide clearance in the supine position was delayed in the gastric tube in general, compared with normal controls (retention index &gt; 40% vs &lt; 10%). There was a significantly higher retention (p &lt; 0.005) in the retrosternal group in the middle third of the tube and the whole tube after intake of the liquid tracer.

We previously reported results of a study conducted from January 1986 to April 1990 of combined chemotherapy and RT vs RT alone when an interim analysis revealed significant benefit for combined therapy. OBJECTIVE: To report the long-term outcomes of a previously reported trial designed to determine if adding chemotherapy during RT improves the survival rate of patients with esophageal carcinoma. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial conducted 1985 to 1990 with follow-up of at least 5 years, followed by a prospective cohort study conducted between May 1990 and April 1991. SETTING: Multi-institution participation, ranging from tertiary academic referral centers to general community practices. PATIENTS: Patients had squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, T1-3 N0-1 M0, adequate renal and bone marrow reserve, and a Karnofsky score of at least 50. Interventions Combined modality therapy (n = 134): 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks, plus cisplatin intravenously on the first day of weeks 1, 5, 8, and 11, and fluorouracil, 1 g/m2 per day by continuous infusion on the first 4 days of weeks 1, 5, 8, and 11. In the randomized study, combined therapy was compared with RT only (n = 62): 64 Gy in 32 fractions over 6.4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall survival, patterns of failure, and toxic effects. RESULTS: Combined therapy significantly increased overall survival compared with RT alone. In the randomized part of the trial, at 5 years of follow-up the overall survival for combined therapy was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15%-37%) compared with 0% following RT. In the succeeding nonrandomized part, combined therapy produced a 5-year overall survival of 14% (95% CI, 6%-23%). Persistence of disease (despite therapy) was the most common mode of treatment failure; however, it was less common in the groups receiving combined therapy (34/130 [26%]) than in the group treated with RT only (23/62 [37%]). Severe acute toxic effects also were greater in the combined therapy groups. There were no significant differences in severe late toxic effects between the groups. However, chemotherapy could be administered as planned in only 89 (68%) of 130 patients (10% had life-threatening toxic effects with combined therapy vs 2% in the RT only group).

There has previously been no direct randomized comparison of these two modalities with survival or disease specific outcome end points. METHODS: Ninety-nine patients with operable squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were randomly allocated to surgery or radiotherapy after stratification for tumor length (&lt; or = or &gt;5 cm). Those randomized to surgery underwent transthoracic esophagectomy with limited lymphadenectomy, whereas those in the radiotherapy arm received 50 gray in 28 fractions followed by a 15-gray boost to the primary tumor. Disease specific outcome was assessed for 4 subgroups: 1) disease specific symptoms, 2) physical symptoms, 3) ability to work, and 4) social/family interaction and global perception of disease specific outcome. The questionnaire was given prior to treatment and posttreatment at 3-month intervals for 1 year. Death was a secondary end point. RESULTS: There was an overall improvement in the quality of swallowing in both treatment arms after treatment and with the passage of time. The swallowing status was better in the surgery arm than in the radiotherapy arm at 6 months after treatment (P = 0.03, Fisher&apos;s exact test). Logistic regression analysis showed randomization arm (P = 0.035), time since treatment (P = 0.003), and pretreatment swallowing status to be significant determinants of posttreatment swallowing status. Surgery was twice as likely to result in improvement in swallowing than radiotherapy after correction for time and pretreatment swallowing status. Overall survival was better in the surgery arm than in the radiotherapy arm (P = 0.002, log rank test) (OR = 2.74 with 95% confidence intervals 1.51-4.98; P &lt; 0.009, Cox proportional hazards model). CONCLUSIONS: Both surgery and radiotherapy can improve the quality of swallowing significantly for patients with operable esophageal carcinoma. Surgery is marginally superior to radiotherapy in improving the quality of swallowing. In this trial, survival in the surgery arm was significantly better than in the radiotherapy arm, although the small number of patients is a limitation</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="146"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: After potentially curative resection of oesophageal cancer and prevertebral gastric tube reconstruction, approximately one-quarter of patients develop secondary dysphagia due to locoregional recurrence. In half of them dysphagia can be prevented by using an extra-anatomical reconstruction route. The present randomized study was conducted to compare the technical and functional results after prevertebral and retrosternal gastric tube reconstruction. METHODS: Sixty patients underwent resection of a carcinoma of the oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction with curative intent. Subsequently, these patients were randomly allocated to either prevertebral (n = 30) or retrosternal (n = 30) gastric tube reconstruction. Early and late complications and functional results were carefully monitored. RESULTS: Creation of the retrosternal tunnel was not accompanied by any perioperative complications. Postoperative recovery, anastomotic leakage and benign stricture formation were not significantly different between the two groups. Functional results, as measured by scintigraphic gastric emptying, quantitative and qualitative oral food intake, and changes in body-weight were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSION: After subtotal oesophagectomy retrosternal gastric tube reconstruction can be performed easily and safely, and gives functional results similar to those obtained with prevertebral reconstruction. In patients at high risk for developing secondary malignant dysphagia the extra-anatomical route is the reconstruction of first choice</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="213"><COL><DATA> Adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to alter the natural history of resected colon cancer. Two regimens (5-fluorouracil [5-FU] plus calcium folinate and 5-FU plus levamisole [Ergamisol]) have been found to prolong disease-free survival and overall survival in affected patients. Previous comparisons of these two regimens indicate that 5-FU plus calcium folinate may offer a small disease-free survival and overall survival advantage. The demonstration that UFT (uracil and tegafur) plus oral calcium folinate (Orzel) offers significant antitumor activity and an acceptable toxicity profile makes this a logical formulation for the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer. The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Protocol C-06 is a randomized comparison of the relative efficacies of 5-FU/calcium folinate vs UFT plus oral calcium folinate. Preliminary analysis of toxicity findings among 473 evaluable patients indicates that both regimens are well tolerated and have similar toxicity profiles. If, in the final survival analysis, UFT plus oral calcium folinate treatment yields the same or better disease-free survival and/or overall survival as the 5-FU/calcium folinate treatment and the toxicity profiles remain similar, it is likely that UFT plus oral calcium folinate will be accepted as a new standard for adjuvant treatment of colon cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="214"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Colonic pouches have gained increasing popularity in reconstruction after low anterior resection. In this prospective, randomized trial colonic pouch reconstruction is compared with side-to-end anastomosis for functional outcome. METHODS: From October 1995 to October 1996, 29 patients had colonic pouch and 30 patients had side-to-end anastomosis reconstruction after low anterior resection. Patients were matched for age, gender, and tumor stage and localization. All patients underwent functional evaluation preoperatively and at three and six months postoperatively. RESULTS: There was no difference in preoperative anorectal function. The operating time was higher in the colonic pouch group (167 vs. 149 minutes). Twenty-three patients (79.3 percent) with colonic pouch had a protective stoma compared with 21 patients (70 percent) with side-to-end anastomosis. Postoperative complications were 10.3 and 13.3 percent, respectively. There was no difference in manometric pressure of the anus, in anorectal angle, and in continence status after three and six months. Stool frequency was higher in the side-to-end anastomosis group, with 2.2 vs. 5.4 per day at three months and 2.3 vs. 3.1 per day at six months. Constipation was noted in two patients with colonic pouch (7 percent) and none in the side-to-end anastomosis group at three months and two vs. none at six months. Maximum tolerated volume and threshold volume was higher in the colonic pouch group at three and at six months. CONCLUSION: Both forms of reconstruction have similar satisfactory long-term functional results. The major advantage of colonic pouch was seen in the immediate postoperative phase</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="215"><COL><DATA> HYPOTHESIS: Senna is more efficient than polyethylene glycol as mechanical preparation before elective colorectal surgery. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, single-blind study. SETTING: Multicenter study (18 centers). PATIENTS: Five hundred twenty-three consecutive patients with colonic or rectal carcinoma or sigmoid diverticular disease, undergoing elective colonic or rectal resection followed by immediate anastomosis. INTERVENTION: Two hundred sixty-two patients were randomly allotted to receive senna (1 package diluted in a glass of water) and 261 to receive polyethylene glycol (2 packages diluted in 2-3 L of water), administered the evening before surgery. All patients received 5% povidone iodine antiseptic enemas (2 L) the evening and the morning before surgery. Ceftriaxone sodium and metronidazole were given intravenously at anesthetic induction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Degree of colonic and rectal cleanliness. RESULTS: Colonic cleanliness was better (P=.006), fecal matter in the colonic lumen was less fluid (P=.001), and the risk for moderate or large intraoperative fecal soiling was lower (P=.11) with senna. Overall, clinical tolerance did not differ significantly between groups, but 20 patients receiving polyethylene glycol (vs 16 with senna) had to interrupt their preparation, and 15 patients (vs 8 with senna) complained of abdominal distension. Senna, however, was better tolerated (P = .03) in the presence of stenosis. There was no statistically significant difference found in the number of patients with postoperative infective complications (14.7% vs 17.7%) or anastomotic leakage (5.3% vs 5.7%) with senna and polyethylene glycol, respectively. CONCLUSION: Mechanical preparation before colonic or rectal resection with senna is better and easier than with polyethylene glycol and should be proposed in patients undergoing colonic or rectal resection, especially patients with stenosis</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="216"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: The objectives of the current study were: 1) to verify whether the addition of modulating low doses of interferon-2b (IFN) to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and levofolinic acid (1-FA) could improve clinical results in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma; and 2) to evaluate the role of tumor burden and liver involvement as prognostic factors. METHODS. A total of 204 untreated patients were randomized to receive 1-FA at 100 mg/m2 and 5-FU at 375 mg/m2 for 5 consecutive days with or without IFN every 3 weeks. IFN was given subcutaneously at 3 MU/day for 7 days starting 2 days before chemotherapy administration. Patients were stratified according to the presence or absence of hepatic disease (H+ or H-) and to total tumor burden defined as &quot;low&quot; or &quot;high&quot; using an area of 10 cm2 as the cutoff value. Thus, four patient categories were obtained: Group 1: H+ &gt; or = 10 cm2; Group 2: H+ &lt; 10 cm2; Group 3: H- &gt; or = 10 cm2; and Group 4: H- &lt; 10 cm2. RESULTS. No differences were observed in the objective response rate (23% for the combination of 1-FA and 5-FU vs. 24% for the 1-FA, 5-FU, and IFN regimen), median duration of response (11 months vs. 10 months), time to progression (5 months in both arms), and median survival (11 months vs. 12 months). A statistically significant improvement in response rate was observed in patients with limited liver involvement versus those with massive involvement independent of the chemotherapy arm (44% vs. 22%; P = 0.02). Overall survival also was improved in patients with limited liver disease (P = 0.0001) and in those without liver involvement (P = 0.004). Multivariate analysis confirmed these data and identified response and female gender as positive prognostic factors. Toxic side effects (mainly diarrhea, mucositis, and fever) were statistically more frequent in the IFN arm. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of low modulating doses of IFN to the regimen of 5-FU and I-FA failed to increase the response rate and survival of patients with advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma and significantly worsened toxicity. High tumor burden and the presence of liver involvement were confirmed prospectively as poor prognostic factors and should be taken in account in designing future Phase II or comparative trials</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="217"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Colon cancer is curable by surgery, but cure rate depends on the extent of disease. We investigated whether adjuvant active specific immunotherapy (ASI) with an autologous tumour cell-BCG vaccine with surgical resection was more beneficial than resection alone in stage II and III colon cancer. METHODS: In a prospective randomised trial, 254 patients with colon cancer were randomly assigned postoperative ASI or no adjuvant treatment. ASI was three weekly vaccinations starting 4 weeks after surgery, with a booster vaccination at 6 months with 10(7) irradiated autologous tumour cells. The first vaccinations contained 10(7) BCG organisms. We followed up patients for time to recurrence, and recurrence-free and overall survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. FINDINGS: The 5.3 year median follow-up (range 8 months to 8 years 11 months) showed 44% (95% CI 7-66) risk reduction for recurrence in the recurrence-free period in all patients receiving ASI (p=0.023). Overall, there were 40 recurrences in the control group and 25 in the ASI group. Analysis by stage showed no significant benefit of ASI in stage III disease. The major impact of ASI was seen in patients with stage II disease, with a significantly longer recurrence-free period (p=0.011) and 61% (18-81) risk reduction for recurrences. Recurrence-free survival was significantly longer with ASI (42% risk reduction for recurrence or death [0-68], p=0.032) and there was a trend towards improved overall survival. INTERPRETATION: ASI gave significant clinical benefit in surgically resected patients with stage II colon cancer. ASI has minimal adverse reactions and should be considered in the management of stage II colon cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="267"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Randomized studies have shown that postoperative chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy (RT) improved local control and survival of patients with stages II or III rectal cancer. However, the optimal sequence of treatments and the optimal chemotherapeutic regimen have not been defined. Modulation of fluorouracil (FU) by leucovorin (LV) has yielded a highly significant difference in response rate from that of FU monotherapy, as suggested by an overview of randomized trials in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. However, this difference in response rate did not translate into a survival benefit. PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact on the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with stages II or III rectal cancer of postoperative RT and concomitant bolus FU administration alone or with additional chemotherapy using FU and high-dose LV. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October 1989 until February 1997, 220 patients were randomized postoperatively to receive either one cycle of chemotherapy with FU (600 mg/m2/week x 6 followed by a two-week rest) and leucovorin (LV, 500 mg/m2/week x 6 as a two-hour infusion) followed by pelvic RT with concomitant FU (400 mg/m2) as a rapid intravenous injection during the first three and last three days of RT, and three more cycles of the same chemotherapy with FU and LV (standard, group A, 111 patients) or pelvic RT with concomitant FU only (experimental, group B, 109 patients). RESULTS: As of August 1998, after a median follow-up of 4.9 years, there was no significant difference in either three-year DFS (Group A, 70.3%; group B, 68.2%, P = 0.53) or OS (group A, 77%; group B, 73.3%. P = 0.75). Cox multivariate analysis revealed stage of disease, number of infiltrated nodes, tumor grade, presence of regional implants and perforation to be significant prognostic factors. The incidence of severe side effects was significantly higher in the patients in group A than in those in group B (32.4% vs. 4.6%, P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of additional chemotherapy with FU and LV into postoperative concomitant RT and bolus infusion of FU does not offer a &gt; or = 10% three-year survival benefit over that of concomitant RT and bolus infusion of FU, and significantly increases toxicity in patients with stages II or III rectal cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="288"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Some clinical studies report the effects of parenteral nutrition in malnourished cancer patients, but few discuss the tumor response to parenteral nutrition plus chemotherapy. If used in combination, the antitumor activity of chemotherapeutic agents may compensate for the tumor stimulation of parenteral nutrition. METHODS: Ninety-two patients with operable gastrointestinal cancer and malnutrition were randomly assigned to four interventions that were administered for 7 days preoperatively: parenteral nutrition alone, parenteral nutrition plus chemotherapy, chemotherapy alone, or no treatment (control). The preintervention and postintervention DNA content, DNA index, percentage of cells in S phase, and tumor cell sensitivity to chemotherapy were measured using image cytometry. RESULTS: Parenteral nutrition resulted in a significant proliferation of tumor cells and a significant increase in the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy; these effects were not seen in tumors of patients receiving parenteral nutrition plus chemotherapy. There was, however, a nonsignificant increase in tumor cell proliferation and sensitivity to chemotherapy in the tumors of subjects receiving combined therapy compared with those of subjects who received chemotherapy alone. The postintervention nutritional status of both the parenteral nutrition group and the parenteral nutrition plus chemotherapy group were significantly better than that of the control group and the chemotherapy group. The short-term, postoperative clinical outcomes in the chemotherapy group were significantly worse than those in the other three groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that combining chemotherapy and nutrition support preoperatively for malnourished patients with gastrointestinal cancer improves short-term nutritional status without increasing the proliferation of tumor cells and prevents the postoperative complications that occur when such patients are given chemotherapy without nutrition support. The results also suggest--but do not prove--that parenteral nutrition may increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy in malnourished patients</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="289"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To document local recurrence in primary rectal cancer when standardised techniques of surgery, radiotherapy, and pathology are used, and to investigate whether the local recurrence rate after total mesorectal excision permits the omission of adjuvant short term preoperative radiotherapy. DESIGN: Prospective randomised study. SETTING: Dutch (n = 80), English (n = 1), German (n = 1), Swedish (n = 9), and Swiss (n = 1) hospitals. SUBJECTS: The first 500 randomised Dutch patients with primary rectal cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Local recurrence, survival, operation-related factors, specific pathological tumour characteristics, short and long term morbidity, and quality of life. RESULTS: Between January 1996 and April 1998, 871 Dutch and 94 other patients were randomised. Our feasibility analysis shows that cooperation between and within the participating disciplines goes well. With regard to the surgical part, this can be confirmed by the large number of operations attended by consultant surgeons (58%). The number of abdominoperineal resections appeared to be low (30%), as did the percentage of lateral margins involved (13%). The rate of adverse effects of radiotherapy was acceptable. Apart from a larger operative blood loss and a higher infective complication rate in the irradiated group, no significant differences were found with regard to morbidity and mortality between the randomised groups.

However, there is no agreement about the optimal duration of this postoperative drainage. The aim of this controlled trial was to compare 1 versus 5 days of transurethral catheterization after rectal resection, with special reference to urinary tract infection and bladder retention. METHODS: One hundred twenty-six patients undergoing rectal resection were included in a prospective randomized study designed to compare the results for patients undergoing 1 day of transurethral catheterization after rectal resection (1-day group) with those for patients undergoing 5 days&apos; catheterization (5-day group). RESULTS: Patients were randomly assigned to the 1-day and 5-day groups (n = 64 and 62, respectively). Clinical findings and surgical procedures were comparable in both groups. Acute urinary retention occurred in 16 patients (25%) in the 1-day group versus 6 (10%) in the 5-day group (P &lt; .05). Urinary tract infection was observed in 13 of 64 patients (20%) in the 1-day group versus 26 of 62 (42%) in the 5-day group (P &lt; .01). Multivariate analysis revealed that after 1 day of catheterization carcinoma of the low rectum and lymph node metastasis were significant risk factors for acute urinary retention (P &lt; .05 for both factors). After selection of patients without low rectum carcinoma, the acute urinary retention rate was comparable in both groups (14% in the 1-day group versus 7% in the 5-day group), but the urinary tract infection rate was significantly lower in the 1-day group versus the 5-day group (14% vs 40, P &lt; .01). CONCLUSIONS: Our controlled study showed that after rectal resection 1 day of urinary drainage can be recommended for most patients.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the erythropoietic response after different doses of r-HuEPO in order to find the minimum effective dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty anemic sideropenic patients (hemoglobin &lt;/=110 g/l; serum iron &lt;600 microg/l) with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract were randomly allocated to two groups: the first (n = 10) received 400 U/kg of r-Hu EPO divided in 4 doses (100 U/kg each, every 4 days); the second (n = 10) received 200 U/kg of r-HuEPO (50 U/kg each, every 4 days). Both groups were given intravenous iron gluconate (125 mg) every day for 15 days. RESULTS: After treatment, the serum iron level significantly rose in both groups. The production of new red blood cells was 176.3+/-90.8 ml in the 200 U/kg group and 268.4+/-79.4 ml in the 400 U/kg group (p = 0.036). The increase of hemoglobin was significantly higher in the 400 U/kg group (22.3+/-2.0 g/l) than in the 200 U/kg group (14.1+/-2.7 g/l) (p = 0.017).

Therefore, this study examined the protective effects of a parenteral Gln supplementation in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma receiving 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/calcium-folinate (CF) chemotherapy. In a prospective study, a total of 24 patients underwent three courses of 5-FU/CF chemotherapy and were randomised with (n = 12) or without (n = 12) glycyl-L-glutamine. Effects on gastrointestinal mucosa were assessed by endoscopic examinations and histomorphometric measurements. Clinical side-effects were documented according to the World Health Organisation grading. In the Gln group, a significant reduction in mucositis and ulcerations of the gastric (P &lt; 0.01) and duodenal mucosa (P &lt; 0.05) was documented after the third course of chemotherapy. In the same group, the villus height/crypt depth ratio was significantly higher after therapy than in the unsupplemented group (1st course P &lt; 0.01; 3rd course P &lt; 0.05).

Improved therapeutic efficacy has been reported using biochemical modulation of 5-FU by leucovorin (LV) or interferon alpha (IFN), the combination of 5-FU/LV frequently considered as standard therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer. In an attempt to enhance the cytotoxicity of 5-FU, a prospective randomised trial was initiated to compare 5-FU/LV with 5-FU/LV plus IFN. Patients were randomised to receive either LV, 100 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.), followed by 5-FU, 500 mg/m2 as a 1-h i.v. infusion, daily for 4 days, followed by weekly infusions until week 8, or the same regimen of 5-FU/LV plus IFN-alpha-2c, 30 micrograms subcutaneously (s.c.), three times weekly. Cycles were repeated after a 2-week rest period. Among 269 enrolled patients, 219 were available for response and 243 for toxicity. An objective tumour response was observed in 38 of 107 (36%) and 28 of 112 (25%) patients in the treatment arms with and without IFN, respectively (difference not significant). There was no significant difference between the two groups in response duration (median 8.4 versus 12.1 months), time to treatment failure (median 6.5 versus 4.9 months), or overall survival (median 10.0 versus 12.6 months). However, patients in the IFN arm experienced significantly more haematological and gastrointestinal toxicity and more frequent alopecia. In conclusion, the addition of IFN to 5-FU/LV in the schedules and doses used in the study did not provide any clinical benefit over 5-FU/LV alone and cannot be recommended for routine use in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="337"><COL><DATA> In a double-blind placebo-controlled study we investigated the effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO), on the perioperative hemoglobin concentration and the use of blood transfusions in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery with a preoperative hemoglobin level &lt;/=8.5 mmol/L. Altogether 100 were included, and 81 patients could be evaluated. A total of 38 patients received r-HuEPO in a dose of 300 IU/kg body weight on day 4 before surgery and 150 IU/kg daily for the following 7 days; 43 patients received placebo. In addition, all patients received daily doses of 200 mg iron orally for 4 days before surgery. There were no differences between the two groups with regard to sex, height, weight, serum electrolytes, and liver function tests at study entry. The preentry hemoglobin concentration was similar in the two groups, with a median value of 7.9 (range 5.3-8.5) mmol/L in the erythropoietin group and 7.6 (5.1-8.5) mmol/L in the placebo group. On the day of surgery the median hemoglobin concentration was 7.8 (5. 3-9.2) mmol/L in the erythropoietin group and 7.2 (4.6-8.5) mmol/L in the placebo group (p &lt; 0.05). On postoperative days 3 and 7 the values were 7.2 (5.3-8.2) and 7.5 (5.4-9.4) mmol/L, respectively, in the erythropoietin group compared to 6.7 (5.2-7.8) and 6.9 (5.1-8.6) mmol/L in the placebo group (p &lt; 0.01). At discharge the hemoglobin concentration was 7.8 (5.9-8.8) mmol/L in the erythropoietin group and 7.2 (5.4-8.6) mmol/L in the placebo group (p &lt; 0.002). The blood loss during operation was similar in the two groups. In the erythropoietin group the median value was 280 ml (range 25-2000 ml), with the lower and upper quartiles 150 and 500 ml, respectively. In the placebo group the blood loss was median 300 ml (range 50-1800 ml), with the lower and upper quartiles 200 and 750 ml, respectively.

We tried to improve these outcomes by treating patients with hepatic arterial infusion of floxuridine plus systemic fluorouracil after liver resection. METHODS: We randomly assigned 156 patients at the time of resection of hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer to receive six cycles of hepatic arterial infusion with floxuridine and dexamethasone plus intravenous fluorouracil, with or without leucovorin, or six weeks of similar systemic therapy alone. Patients were stratified according to previous treatment and the number of liver metastases identified at operation. The study end points were overall survival, survival without recurrence of hepatic metastases, and survival without any metastases at two years. RESULTS: The actuarial rate of overall survival at two years was 86 percent in the group treated with local plus systemic chemotherapy and 72 percent in the group given systemic therapy alone (P=0.03). The median survival was 72.2 months in the combined-therapy group and 59.3 months in the monotherapy group, with a median follow-up of 62.7 months. After two years, the rates of survival free of hepatic recurrence were 90 percent in the monotherapy group and 60 percent in the monotherapy group (P&lt;0.001), and the respective rates of progression-free survival were 57 percent and 42 percent (P=0.07). At two years, the risk ratio for death was 2.34 among patients treated with systemic therapy alone, as compared with patients who received combined therapy (95 percent confidence interval, 1.10 to 4.98; P=0.027), after adjustment for important variables. The rates of adverse effects of at least moderate severity were similar in the two groups, except for a higher frequency of diarrhea and hepatic effects in the combined-therapy group.

Adjuvant intra-arterial chemotherapy was therefore considered a promising therapeutic approach in high-risk patients. PATIENTS/METHODS: From July 1984 to December 1985, a total of 42 consecutive patients underwent R0 resection of colorectal liver metastases. Thirty patients with mesenteric lymph-node metastases (Dukes C) were randomised into two groups. In 14 group-A patients, a hepatic artery port catheter was placed during liver resection. Four courses of adjuvant chemotherapy were administered at 4-week intervals, consisting of mitomycin C (8 mg/m2, day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (800 mg/m2, days 1-5). Sixteen group-B patients served as controls. The 12 patients with no mesenteric lymph-node metastases (Dukes A/B) were included in the follow-up program.

The hypothesis that chronomodulation of delivery rate along the 24 h time scale would improve the tolerable doses of both drugs was tested. Combined HAI FUDR (80 mg/m2/day) and i.v. 5-FU (1200 mg/m2/day) were administered for five consecutive days every 3 weeks, either as a constant rate infusion (schedule A, 27 patients) or as chronotherapy (schedule B, 29 patients). This latter regimen consisted of a sinusoidal modulation of the delivery rate over the 24 h scale with a maximum at 16:00 for FUDR and 4:00 for 5-FU. Intrapatient dose escalation up to the individual maximum tolerated doses (MTD) was planned for both drugs in the absence of any previous grade 3 or 4 toxicity. All patients had metastatic colorectal cancer, with adjuvant or palliative chemotherapy given to six patients (22%) on schedule A and 12 patients on schedule B (41%). Severe stomatitis occurred in 71% of the patients and was dose limiting. No hepatic toxicity was encountered.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Numerous retrospective reports and one prospective randomized trial have suggested that the performance of an extended lymphadenectomy in association with a pancreaticoduodenal resection may improve long-term survival for some patients with pancreatic and other periampullary adenocarcinomas. Many of these previously published studies can be criticized for their retrospective and nonrandomized designs, for the inclusion of nonconcurrent control groups, and for their small numbers. METHODS: Between April 1996 and December 1997, 114 patients with periampullary adenocarcinoma were enrolled in an ongoing, prospective, randomized trial at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. After intraoperative verification of completely resected periampullary adenocarcinoma, the patients were randomized to receive either a standard pancreaticoduodenectomy (removing only the peripancreatic lymph nodes en bloc with the specimen) or a radical pancreaticoduodenectomy (standard resection plus distal gastrectomy and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy). All pathology specimens were reviewed and categorized. The postoperative morbidity, mortality, and short-term outcomes were examined. RESULTS: Of the 114 patients randomized, 56 underwent a standard pancreaticoduodenectomy and 58 a radical pancreaticoduodenectomy. The two groups were statistically similar with regard to age and gender, but there was a higher percentage of white patients in the radical group. All the patients in the radical group underwent distal gastric resection, whereas 86% of the patients in the standard group underwent pylorus preservation. The mean operative time in the radical group was 6.8 hours, compared with 6.2 hours in the standard group. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to the intraoperative blood loss, transfusion requirements, location of primary tumor, mean tumor size, positive lymph node status, or positive margin status. There were three deaths in the standard group and two in the radical group. The complication rates were 34% for the standard group and 40% for the radical group. Patients undergoing radical resection had a higher incidence of early delayed gastric emptying but had similar rates of other complications, such as pancreatic fistula, wound infection, intraabdominal abscess, and need for reoperation. The mean total number of lymph nodes resected was higher in the radical group. Of the 58 patients in the radical group, only 10% had metastatic carcinoma in the resected retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and none of those patients had the retroperitoneal nodes as the only site of lymph node involvement. The 1-year actuarial survival rate for patients surviving the immediate postoperative periods was 77% for the standard resection group and 83% for the radical resection group. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that radical pancreaticoduodenectomy (with the addition of a distal gastrectomy and extended retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy to a standard pancreaticoduodenectomy) can be performed with similar morbidity and mortality to standard pancreaticoduodenectomy. However, the survival data are not sufficiently mature and the numbers of patients enrolled are not adequate to allow firm conclusions to be drawn regarding survival benefit</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="561"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To investigate whether dose escalation of megestrol acetate (MA) improves response rate and survival in comparison with standard doses of MA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred sixty-eight patients with metastatic breast cancer, positive and/or unknown estrogen and progesterone receptors, zero or one prior trial of hormonal therapy, and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were prospectively randomized into three groups. The groups of patients received either MA 160 mg/d (one tablet per day), MA 800 mg/d (five tablets per day), or MA 1,600 mg/d (10 tablets per day). RESULTS: Patient characteristics were well balanced in the three treatment groups. Three hundred sixty-six patients received treatment and were included in the analyses. The response rates were 23%, 27%, and 27% for the 160-mg, 800-mg, and 1,600-mg arms, respectively. Response duration correlated inversely with dose. Median durations of response were 17 months, 14 months, and 8 months for the 160-mg, 800-mg, and 1,600-mg arms, respectively. No significant differences in the treatment arms were noted for time to disease progression or for survival; survival medians were 28 months (low dose), 24 months (mid dose) and 29 months (high dose). The most frequent and troublesome toxicity, weight gain, was dose-related, with approximately 20% of patients on the two higher-dose arms reporting weight gain of more than 20% of their prestudy weight, compared with only 2% in the 160-mg dose arm. CONCLUSION: With a median follow-up of 8 years, these results demonstrate no advantage for dose escalation of MA in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="562"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To define the correct time to remove the drain after axillary dissection for carcinoma of the breast.

INTERVENTIONS: 42 were randomised to have the drain removed on postoperative day 3, and 48 to keep the drain in until discharge had decreased to less than 35 ml/24 hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Formation of seromas or wound infections, need to reinsert the drain, and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS: Early removal of the axillary drain was associated with a significantly higher incidence of seromas (9/42 compared with 2/48, p = 0.02) unless the total amount of fluid drained during the first three postoperative days was less than 250 ml.

METHODS: One hundred and seventy-seven patients who previously were untreated for recurrent or metastatic breast carcinoma were entered into the study; 7 patients could not be assessed. The final analysis relates to 85 patients who were treated with FAC and 85 patients who were treated with NA, of whom 21 (25%) and 44 (52%), respectively, had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall response rates were similar for the two treatments and were unaffected by prior exposure to adjuvant therapy; overall response rate (ORR) for FAC was 74% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 65-83%), and the ORR for NA was 75% (95% CI, 66-84%). The activity of NA in patients with liver involvement was greater than that of FAC in terms of survival. Overall survivals were similar, with a median of 17.3 months for patients receiving FAC and 17.8 months for patients receiving NA. Severe toxicity was uncommon with World Health Organization Grade 3-4 neutropenia affecting only 7% of patients in each arm of the study. NA was associated with a higher incidence of mild to moderate constipation, neurotoxicity, and phlebitis, whereas FAC produced a slight excess of mild cardiotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of these two regimens is very similar, although NA may be more active in a subset of patients with visceral metastatic disease, particularly liver involvement. It is clear that, in a direct comparison with an established three-drug regimen, the newer two-drug combination of NA demonstrated equivalent activity with no significant excess of Grade 3-4 toxicity</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="665"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Aminoleban EN contains branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and is known to be beneficial for the protein-energy malnutrition in cirrhotic patients. Patients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma often have background cirrhosis, and the present study investigates the effect of Aminoleban EN on these patients after hepatic resection for the primary disease. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled clinical trial, to which 50 patients were recruited, was carried out. The study group received Aminoleban EN in addition to normal diet for 12 weeks and the control group received an isonitrogenous and isocaloric diet only. RESULTS: After exclusions, there were 21 patients in the study group and 23 patients in the control. The study group had a shorter hospital stay, and had a significantly higher haemoglobin level, higher sodium level, higher albumin level and lower bilirubin during the postoperative course. There was no significant difference in terms of neuropsychiatric symptoms or Karnofsky performance score. There was no difference in gastrointestinal symptoms or other signs. No adverse reaction was associated with the administration of Aminoleban, and there was no significant difference in terms of morbidity and mortality between the two groups of patients. CONCLUSION: Aminoleban EN is safe to administer and does not have significant adverse effects. It contributes to a shorter hospital stay and quicker improvement of liver function in the early postoperative period. These beneficial results require only a 12-week period of administration of BCAA after operation</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="666"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: A multi-centre randomized phase II study of single agent nolatrexed dihydrochloride versus doxorubicin was undertaken in Chinese patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to study and compare the clinical efficacy of the two drugs. METHODS: Fifty-four patients with clinical or histological diagnosis of HCC were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive nolatrexed or doxorubicin. Nolatrexed 725 mg/m(2)/day was given by continuous infusion via a central venous device for 5 days and doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) was given as a rapid intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. RESULTS: No objective responses were observed in either treatment arm. Two patients in the nolatrexed arm and none in the doxorubicin arm had &gt;50% decline in serum alpha-fetoprotein. The median survival for the patients in the nolatrexed and doxorubicin arms was 139 days and 104 days, respectively. Moderate toxicities including leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, mucositis and skin rash were observed in both treatment arms. CONCLUSION: Nolatrexed and doxorubicin are minimally active in the treatment of advanced HCC.

In this prospective randomised trial, we aimed to find out if one dose of postoperative adjuvant intra-arterial iodine-131-labelled lipiodol could reduce the rate of local recurrence and increase disease-free and overall survival. METHODS: Patients who underwent curative resection for hepatocellular carcinoma and recovered within 6 weeks were randomly assigned one 1850 MBq dose of 131I-lipiodol or no further treatment (controls). We compared rates of recurrence and disease-free and overall survival (the primary endpoints) between the two groups by intention to treat. We planned an interim analysis when 30 patients (both groups together) had been followed up for a median of 2 years, with the intention of stopping early if the between-group difference in disease-free survival was significant (p=0.029). FINDINGS: Between April, 1992, and August, 1997, we recruited 43 patients: 21 received intra-arterial 131I-lipiodol and 22 received no adjuvant treatment. During a median follow-up of 34.6 (range 14.1-69.7) months, there were six (28.5%) recurrences among the 21 patients in the adjuvant treatment, compared with 13 (59%) in the controls (p=0.04). Median disease-free survival in the treatment and control groups was 57.2 (0.4-69.7) and 13.6 (2.1-68.3) months, respectively (p=0.037). 3-year overall survival in the treatment and control groups was 86.4% and 46.3%, respectively (p=0.039). The interim analysis showed a significant increase in disease-free survival in the treatment group compared with the controls (p=0.01), so we closed the trial early. 131I-lipiodol had no significant toxic effects. INTERPRETATION: In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, one 1850 MBq dose of intra-arterial 131I-lipiodol given after curative resection significantly decreases the rate of recurrence and increases disease-free and overall survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="668"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) of the hepatic artery is a common treatment method for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but it often induces gastric mucosal injury. We examined whether or not rebamipide administration, beginning 1 week before and ending 2 weeks afterTAE, can prevent worsening of gastric mucosal disorders. METHODS: The subjects were 73 chronic hepatitis C or type C liver cirrhosis patients who concomitantly had HCC and received TAE in our hospital. The patients were randomly allocated to the rebamipide group (oral, 300 mg/day for 3 weeks starting 1 week before TAE) or the non-rebamipide group. Gastric endoscopy was performed 1 week before and 2 weeks afterTAE and the presence of erythema, erosion and/or submucosal haemorrhagic spots was monitored. Based on the findings, gastric mucosal disorder before and after TAE was quantitatively evaluated using the modified Lanza score (MLS). RESULTS: Overall, MLS after TAE increased significantly (P&lt; 0.05). However, in the rebamipide group, MLS did not change. The MLS after TAE increased significantly in patients who had either liver cirrhosis, oesophageal varices or gastropathy (P&lt; 0.01 or &lt; 0.05). In the non-rebamipide group, a significant increase in MLS after TAE was observed in patients who had one of the above-mentioned three diseases (P&lt; 0.01 or &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Gastric lesions which were present before TAE were significantly worsened after TAE.

The aim of this study was twofold: 1) to investigate the correlation between intrahepatic metastatic recurrence (IM) and the HAI score of the noncancerous region of the liver and 2) to estimate the usefulness of postoperative preventive chemotherapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: The study included 158 consecutive patients who underwent curative resection for HCC and had been observed for &gt; 1 year. Based on the HAI scores of the noncancerous region the patients were classified into 3 groups: those with mild hepatitis (n = 33) (i.e., with HAI scores of 0-5), those with moderate hepatitis (n = 77) (with HAI scores of 6-9), and those with severe hepatitis (n = 48) (those with HAI scores of &gt; or = 10). In addition, a prospective randomized trial of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was performed for 21 patients with moderate hepatitis. RESULTS: The patients in the moderate hepatitis group were found to be at higher risk for IM recurrence within 2 years after HCC resection compared with those patients in the mild (P = 0.05) and severe (P &lt; 0.01) hepatitis groups. The incidences of more than two tumors and portal vein involvement in patients with moderate hepatitis were much higher than in those patients with mild or severe hepatitis. Multivariate analysis showed that intraoperative bleeding volume, the number of nodules, portal vein involvement, and moderate hepatitis were independent predictive factors for IM recurrence free survival. Ten patients with moderate hepatitis had received postoperative intrahepatic arterial chemotherapy (2-3 courses with a maximum dose of 80 mg of cisplatin and 10 mg of mitomycin C at 1-month intervals) for the last 3 years. Although the number of patients was small, the therapy improved the disease free survival rate significantly compared with 11 patients who received no therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The patients with moderate hepatitis (HAI score of 6-9) had the highest rate of IM recurrence among the three HAI groups.

Both parenteral and oral progestins yield similar serum levels and response rates, which range from 18% to 34%. The one major study that used oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) noted a response rate at the lower end of the range (18%) and much poorer progression-free and overall survival times (4 and 10.5 months, respectively) than previously reported. The present study sought to confirm this earlier study of oral MPA, to assess the importance of prognostic factors such as histologic grade and receptor levels, and to determine whether a higher dose of MPA would yield a higher response rate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred ninety-nine eligible women with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma were randomized to receive oral MPA either 200 mg/d or 1, 000 mg/d until unacceptable toxicity intervened or their disease progressed. RESULTS: Among 145 patients receiving the low-dose regimen, there were 25 complete (17%) and 11 partial (8%) responses for an overall response rate of 25%. The 154 patients receiving the high-dose regimen experienced 14 (9%) complete and 10 (6%) partial responses for an overall response rate of 15%. Median durations of progression-free survival were 3.2 months and 2.5 months for the low-dose and high-dose regimens, respectively. Median survival durations were 11.1 months and 7.0 months, respectively. The adjusted relative odds of responding to the high-dose regimen compared with the low-dose regimen was 0.61 (90% confidence interval, 0.36 to 1.04). Prognostic factors having a significant impact on the probability of response included initial performance status, age, histologic grade, and progesterone receptor concentration. Compliance with oral therapy was documented with serum levels 1 month after starting therapy, when possible. MPA levels were commensurate with the assigned dose and schedule. CONCLUSION: Oral MPA is active against endometrial carcinoma. Response to progestin therapy is more frequent among patients with a well-differentiated histology and positive progesterone receptor status. This study provides no evidence to support the use of MPA 1,000 mg/d orally instead of MPA 200 mg/d orally. In fact, the trends suggest the opposite. The use of oral MPA 200 mg/d is a reasonable initial approach to the treatment of advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma, particularly those lesions that are well-differentiated and/or progesterone receptor-positive (&gt; 50 fmol/mg cytosol protein).

The authors conducted a randomized trial to test the benefit of adding tamoxifen to dacarbazine and carboplatin chemotherapy for previously untreated patients with metastatic melanoma. METHODS: Eligible patients with histologically confirmed, measurable metastatic melanoma were randomized to carboplatin 300 mg/m2 and dacarbazine 1 g/m2 administered intravenously on Day 1 with or without tamoxifen 20 mg/day administered orally throughout the treatment period (C + D +/- T). Chemotherapy was repeated in 28-day treatment cycles for a minimum of 2 cycles or until disease progression. The study was designed to be stopped after accrual of 28 patients per treatment arm based on 80% power to detect an improvement in response from 20% to 40% among patients treated with tamoxifen. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were randomized; all were evaluable for response and survival. The 2 treatment groups were well balanced for various prognostic factors; 75% of patients had predominant visceral disease. Complete and partial responses combined were 10.7% in the C + D arm and 14.3% in the C + D + T arm (P=1.0). Median survival was 7 months for C + D and 4.6 months for C + D + T (the difference was not significant). The median time to disease progression was worse for the patients treated with tamoxifen (P=0.03). Toxicity was similar in the two groups, with no episodes of deep venous thrombosis.

METHODS: One hundred and seventeen patients with metastatic melanoma randomly were assigned to receive cisplatin, 100 mg/m2, followed after a 3-day rest period by IL-2, 18 x 10(6) IU/m2, on Days 3-6 and Days 17-21 (Arm 1) or cisplatin and IL-2 using an identical schedule plus subcutaneous IFN, 9 x 10(6) U, 3 times a week during IL-2 administration (Arm 2). In the absence of disease progression or undue toxicity, the cycle could be repeated on Day 29. Patients who responded after two cycles eventually could receive a third cycle. One hundred and one patients were evaluable for toxicity and efficacy. RESULTS: On treatment Arm 1, 3 patients (6%) achieved a complete response (CR) and 5 patients (10%) achieved a partial response (PR) with a median response duration of 3.8 months for the CRs and 8.7 months for the PRs. On treatment Arm 2, 2 patients (3%) achieved a CR (durations of 5.9 and 33.1 months, respectively) and 11 patients (21%) a PR with a median response duration of 8.3 months. The median durations of overall survival were 10.4 months (range, 1.1-39.7+ months) and 10.9 months (range, 0.5-38.1+ months) for treatment Arms 1 and 2, respectively. The toxicity profile was consistent with the known side effects of this IL-2 intravenous regimen combined with cisplatin chemotherapy and IFN. Toxicity was more pronounced in treatment Arm 2 compared with treatment Arm 1. There were 2 and 4 patients, respectively, in treatment Arms 1 and 2 who died within 28 days after completion of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The observed overall response rates of 16% and 25% in treatment Arms 1 and 2, respectively, is lower than that expected with biochemotherapy; despite the fact that the objective of the trial was not to show any difference between the 2 treatment arms, our results indicate that the addition of IFN, at the dose and schedule used in this trial, fails to improve the activity of a cisplatin/IL-2 regimen significantly in patients with metastatic melanoma. Although response rates were relatively low, the median overall survival was nearly 1 year in both groups</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="802"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: The combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapeutic agents such as interleukin-2 and interferon alfa-2b has been reported to provide improved treatment results in patients with metastatic melanoma, compared with the use of chemotherapy alone. We have performed a prospective randomized trial in patients with metastatic melanoma, comparing treatment with chemotherapy to treatment with chemoimmunotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred two patients with metastatic melanoma were prospectively randomized to receive chemotherapy composed of tamoxifen, cisplatin, and dacarbazine or this same chemotherapy followed by interferon alfa-2b and interleukin-2. Objective responses, survival, and toxicity in the two groups were evaluated at a median potential follow-up of 42 months. RESULTS: In 52 patients randomized to receive chemotherapy, there were 14 objective responses (27%), including four complete responses. In 50 patients randomized to receive chemoimmunotherapy, there were 22 objective responses (44%) (P2 = .071), including three complete responses. In both treatment groups, the duration of partial responses was often short, and there was a trend toward a survival advantage for patients receiving chemotherapy alone (P2 = .052; median survival of 15.8 months compared with 10.7 months). Treatment-related toxicities were greater in patients receiving chemoimmunotherapy. CONCLUSION: With the treatment regimens used in this study, the addition of immunotherapy to combination chemotherapy increased toxicity but did not increase survival. The use of combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens is not recommended in the absence of well-designed, prospective, randomized protocols showing the benefit of this treatment strategy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="921"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the multicenter application of intraoperative lymphatic mapping, sentinel lymphadenectomy, and selective complete lymph node dissection (LM/SL/SCLND) for the management of early-stage melanoma. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The multidisciplinary technique of LM/SL/SCLND has been widely adopted, but not validated in a multicenter trial. The authors began the international Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT) 5 years ago to evaluate the survival of patients with early-stage primary melanoma after wide excision alone versus wide excision plus LM/SL/SCLND. This study examined the accuracy of LM/SL/SCLND in the MSLT, using the experience of the organizing center (John Wayne Cancer Institute [JWCI]) as a standard for comparison. METHODS: Before entering patients into the randomization phase, each center in the MSLT was required to finish a 30-case learning phase with complete nuclear medicine, pathology, and surgical review. Selection of MSLT patients in the LM/SL/SCLND treatment arm was based on complete pathologic and surgical data. The comparison group of JWCI patients was selected using these criteria: primary cutaneous melanoma having a thickness &gt; or =1 mm with a Clark level &gt; or =III, or a thickness &lt;1 mm with a Clark level &gt; or =IV (MSLT criterion); LM/SL performed between June 1, 1985, and December 30, 1998; and patient not entered in the MSLT. The accuracy of LM/SL/SCLND was determined by comparing the rates of sentinel node (SN) identification and the incidence of SN metastases in the MSLT and JWCI groups. RESULTS: There were 551 patients in the MSLT group and 584 patients in the JWCI group. In both groups, LM performed with blue dye plus a radiocolloid was more successful (99.1 %) than LM performed with blue dye alone (95.2%) (p = 0.014). After a center had completed the 30-case learning phase, the success of SN identification in the MSLT group was independent of the center&apos;s case volume or experience in the MSLT. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymphadenectomy can be successfully learned and applied in a standardized fashion with high accuracy by centers worldwide. Successful SN identification rates of 97% can be achieved, and the incidence of nodal metastases approaches that of the organizing center. A multidisciplinary approach (surgery, nuclear medicine, and pathology) and a learning phase of &gt; or =30 consecutive cases per center are sufficient for mastery of LM/SL in cutaneous melanoma. Lymphatic mapping performed using blue dye plus radiocolloid is superior to LM using blue dye alone</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="950"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: To study the survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in gastric cancer, seven cancer centres in Japan carried out a phase III clinical trial of adjuvant chemotherapy after curative gastrectomy for macroscopically serosa- negative gastric cancer. METHODS: 579 patients were enrolled in the study, strat ified by disease stage (T1, n=188; T2, n=323), and allocated randomly adjuvant c hemotherapy or no further treatment. 285 of 288 cases in the treatment group and 288 of 291 in the control group were eligible. Six cases were excluded because they did not fulfill the entry criteria. The treatment group had intravenous mit omycin (1.4 mg/m2) and fluorouracil (166.7 mg/m2) twice weekly for 3 weeks after surgery, and oral UFT (uracil plus tegafur, 300 mg daily) for 18 months. Analys es were by intention to treat. FINDINGS: No serious toxic effects were observed in the treatment group. At median follow-up of 72 months, 59 patients in the control group and 47 in the treatment group had died. There was no significant difference in survival between the groups (5-year survival 82.9% control vs 85.8% treated; hazard ratio 0.738 [95% CI 0.498-1.093]). 5-year survival of patients wit h T1 (mucosal or submucosal) cancer in the control and treatment groups was 94.9 % versus 92.0%, and that of patients with T2 (muscularis propria or subserosa) cancer was 76.9% versus 83.0%. However, a test for heterogeneity and interaction over T1  and T2 subgroups revealed no significant difference in terms of drug res ponse. INTERPRETATION: There was no survival benefit with this adjuvant therapy regimen for patients with macroscopically serosa-negative gastric cancer (T1 and T2) after curative gastrectomy. Patients with T1 cancer can be excluded from fu ture trials, because curative surgery alone yielded a very good survival rate an d there seemed no need for adjuvant therapy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="951"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND/AIMS: The impact of psychotherapeutic support on survival time in patients with gastrointestinal cancer undergoing surgery was studied. METHODOLOGY: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in cooperation with the Departments of General Surgery and Medical Psychology, University Hospital of Hamburg, Germany. Two hundred and seventy-one consenting patients with a preliminary diagnosis of cancer of the esophagus, stomach, liver/gallbladder, pancreas or colon/rectum were stratified by gender and randomly assigned to a control group that received standard care, as provided on the surgical wards, or to an experimental group that received formal psychotherapeutic support in addition to routine care during the hospital stay. Patients in both groups completed the EORTC-Quality of Life questionnaire pre-operatively, post-operatively, and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months following surgery. Date of death, if applicable, was also recorded. Unadjusted and adjusted survival analyses were performed. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated better survival for the experimental group than for the control group. The unadjusted significance level for group differences was p = 0.002 for survival up to 2 years. Cox regression models that took TNM Staging or the Residual Tumor Classification into account also found significant differences at the 2-year follow-up. Secondary analyses found that most of the differences in favor of the experimental group occurred in females and in patients with stomach, pancreatic, primary liver or colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that patients with gastrointestinal cancer, particularly those who are female and those who undergo surgery for stomach, pancreatic, primary liver or colorectal cancer, benefit from a formal program of psychotherapeutic support in terms of survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="955"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Curative resection is the treatment of choice for gastric cancer, but it is unclear whether this operation should include an extended (D2) lymph-node dissection, as recommended by the Japanese medical community, or a limited (D1) dissection. We conducted a randomized trial in 80 Dutch hospitals in which we compared D1 with D2 lymph-node dissection for gastric cancer in terms of morbidity, postoperative mortality, long-term survival, and cumulative risk of relapse after surgery. METHODS: Between August 1989 and July 1993, a total of 996 patients entered the study. Of these patients, 711 (380 in the D1 group and 331 in the D2 group) underwent the randomly assigned treatment with curative intent, and 285 received palliative treatment. The procedures for quality control included instruction and supervision in the operating room and monitoring of the pathological results. RESULTS: Patients in the D2 group had a significantly higher rate of complications than did those in the D1 group (43 percent vs. 25 percent, P&lt;0.001), more postoperative deaths (10 percent vs. 4 percent, P= 0.004), and longer hospital stays (median, 16 vs. 14 days; P&lt;0.001). Five-year survival rates were similar in the two groups: 45 percent for the D1 group and 47 percent for the D2 group (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -9.6 percent to +5.6 percent). The patients who had R0 resections (i.e., who had no microscopical evidence of remaining disease), excluding those who died postoperatively, had cumulative risks of relapse at five years of 43 percent with D1 dissection and 37 percent with D2 dissection (95 percent confidence interval for the difference, -2.4 percent to +14.4 percent).

The purpose of the study was to determine the activity of high doses of 5-fluorouracil and epirubicin (FE) vs. the same combination + cisplatin (FEP), and particularly the value of cisplatin in the combination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 122 patients was included in the study; 110 of them were assessable. In the FE arm, the treatment involved 1000 mg/m2 in a 6-hr infusion of 5-fluorouracil on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 and 120 mg/m2 of epirubicin i.v. on day 1. In the FEP arm, the same combination of cytostatics + cisplatin (30 mg/m2) was administered on days 2 and 4. The cycles were repeated after 4 weeks. Altogether, 468 cycles of chemotherapy were given (FE, 240; FEP, 228). RESULTS: In the FE arm, 56 patients were assessable, with 2 complete and 14 partial remissions (28.6%); in the FEP arm, 4 complete and 19 partial remissions (42.6%) were observed in 54 assessable patients. Median survival in the FE group was 7.1 months and in the FEP group 9.6 months. The survival difference was statistically significant (Cox&apos;s test, P&lt;0.05). The most frequent side effects included grade 2 and 3 alopecia (FE, 93%; FEP, 94%) and grade 2 and 3 vomiting (FE, 20%; FEP, 35%). Grade 3 and 4 leukopenia was observed in 9% of patients in the FE group and in 13% of patients in the FEP group, with 6 cases of febrile neutropenia (FE, 4%; FEP, 7%). Stenocardia was registered in 1 patient in the FE group and in 2 patients in the FEP group. No treatment-related death was registered.

Between 1992 and 1995, 274 patients with adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma were randomized from eight oncology centres in the UK and analysed for response and survival. The overall response rate was 46% (95% confidence interval (CI), 37-55%) with ECF, and 21% (95% CI, 13-28%) with FAMTX (P = 0.00003). The median survival was 8.7 months with ECF and 6.1 months with FAMTX (P = 0.0005). The 2-year survival rates were 14% (95% CI, 8-20%) for the ECF arm, and 5% (95% CI, 2-10%) for the FAMTX arm (P = 0.03). Histologically complete surgical resection following chemotherapy was achieved in ten patients in the ECF arm (three pathological complete responses to chemotherapy) and three patients in the FAMTX arm (no pathological complete responses). The ECF regimen resulted in a response and survival advantage compared with FAMTX chemotherapy. The probability of long-term survival following surgical resection of residual disease is increased by this treatment.

Much better long-term survival has been reported in retrospective/non-randomized studies with D2 resections that involve a radical extended regional lymphadenectomy than with the standard D1 resections. In this paper we report the long-term survival of patients entered into a randomized study, with follow-up to death or 3 years in 96% of patients and a median follow-up of 6.5 years. In this prospective trial D1 resection (removal of regional perigastric nodes) was compared with D2 resection (extended lymphadenectomy to include level 1 and 2 regional nodes). Central randomization followed a staging laparotomy. Out of 737 patients with histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma registered, 337 patients were ineligible by staging laparotomy because of advanced disease and 400 were randomized. The 5-year survival rates were 35% for D1 resection and 33% for D2 resection (difference -2%, 95% CI = -12%-8%). There was no difference in the overall 5-year survival between the two arms (HR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.87-1.39, where HR &gt; 1 implies a survival benefit to D1 surgery). Survival based on death from gastric cancer as the event was similar in the D1 and D2 groups (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.79-1.39) as was recurrence-free survival (HR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.82-1.29). In a multivariate analysis, clinical stages II and III, old age, male sex and removal of spleen and pancreas were independently associated with poor survival. These findings indicate that the classical Japanese D2 resection offers no survival advantage over D1 surgery. However, the possibility that D2 resection without pancreatico-splenectomy may be better than standard D1 resection cannot be dismissed by the results of this trial</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="959"><COL><DATA> Recent observations and our experience that histologic types of gastric cancer related significantly to patterns of recurrence prompted us to develop intraoperative and postoperative chemotherapy based on the preoperatively diagnosed histologic types of cancer and to evaluate its effectiveness by a prospective randomized trial. This chemotherapy regimen consisted of the intraoperative administration of mitomycin C (MMC) and postoperative administration of cisplatin (80 mg/patient, day 14), and tegaful and uracil (UFT) (300-600 mg/day for 2 years). Patients with a diffuse type of cancer were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: no intraoperative chemotherapy and UFT 300 mg/day (P0 group, n = 16); intraoperative chemotherapy and UFT 300 mg/day (P1 group, n = 13); or UFT 600 mg/day (P2 group, n = 17). Patients with an intestinal type of cancer were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: H0 (n = 17), H1 (n = 12), and H2 (n = 12); each group was subjected to the same protocols as the P0, P1, and P2 groups, respectively, except for the MMC administration route. MMC (10 mg/patient) was administered intraoperatively into the intraperitoneal cavity (P1 and P2 groups) or the portal vein (H1 and H2 groups). All patients underwent curative resection. Background factors did not differ significantly among the treatment groups. The overall survival rates were progressively worsened in the order of P2, P1, and P0 or H2, H1, and H0, respectively. The survival rate of the P2 group was statistically higher than that of the P0 group (p &lt; 0.05). The intermediate-term survival rate of the P2 group or H2 group was significantly higher than that of the P0 group (p &lt; 0.05) or H0 group (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. These results suggest the effectiveness of this therapy and the possible eradication of potential micrometastatic foci outside the surgical field by the direct administration of chemotherapeutic agents to the predicted recurrence site</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="960"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: The majority of advanced gastric carcinoma patients with serosal invasion die of peritoneal recurrence, even when a curative gastrectomy is performed, because peritoneal recurrence occurs due to intraperitoneal free tumor cells that detach from the serosal-invaded focus. In an attempt to prevent peritoneal recurrence, intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemoperfusion (IHCP) treatment was combined with aggressive surgery. METHODS: Between March 1987 and December 1996, 141 gastric carcinoma patients with macroscopic serosal invasion were allocated randomly to 2 groups. Seventy-one patients underwent IHCP combined with surgery (IHCP group) and the remaining 70 patients underwent surgery alone (control group). IHCP was performed just after gastric resection and alimentary tract reconstruction under general anesthesia along with systemic hyperthermia. RESULTS: Postoperative complications were reported in 2 of the 71 patients in the IHCP group and in 2 of the 70 patients in the control group. The peritoneal recurrence rate in the IHCP group was significantly decreased (P = 0.0000847) compared with that in the control group. The 2-year, 4-year, and 8-year survival rates for the IHCP group were 88%, 76%, and 62%, respectively, whereas those for the control group were 77%, 58%, and 49%, respectively. The IHCP group thus reaped a significant survival benefit (P = 0.0362) compared with the control group.

In recent years interest has expanded to superextended lymphadenectomy (D4) of nodes around abdominal aorta (para-aortic lymph nodes from aortic hiatus to aortic bifurcation). Because the therapeutic value of this D4 procedure remains controversial, we initiated a prospective study to compare D3 and D4 lymphadenectomy. METHODS: Seventy patients with T3 or T4 gastric cancer and without macroscopic metastasis to the para-aortic nodes treated by potentially curative total gastrectomy were randomized to D4 (group A, n = 35) and D3 (group B, n = 35) lymphadenectomies. RESULTS: Metastases to para-aortic nodes were found in 4 patients. Postoperative survival after D4 resection was not statistically significant between the groups. Postoperative morbidity for group A was greater. In group A 4 patients had postoperative retention of intra-abdominal fluid (lymphorrhea) and 4 others had prolonged diarrhea. One patient in each group died of postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of microscopic disease in grossly normal para-aortic lymph nodes may generate occasional long-term survivors. Selecting appropriate candidates who might benefit from D4 resections needs to be refined.

Although the mechanisms involved in the antitumor effects of lentinan have been reported experimentally, the clinical outcome on prolongation of survival and improvement of quality of life in gastric cancer patients with unresectable or recurrent diseases has yet to be clarified. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether administration of lentinan prolonged survival or improved quality of life in these patients.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: There is controversy as to whether the optimal surgery for gastric cancer in the distal half of the stomach is subtotal or total gastrectomy. Although only a randomized trial can resolve this oncologic dilemma, the first step is to demonstrate whether the two procedures are penalized by different postoperative morbidity and mortality rates. METHODS: A total of 624 patients with cancer in the distal half of the stomach were randomized to subtotal gastrectomy (320) or total gastrectomy (304), both associated with a second-level lymphadenectomy, in a multicenter trial aimed at assessing the oncologic outcome after the two procedures. The end points considered were the occurrence of a postoperative event, complication, or death and length of postoperative stay. RESULTS: Nonfatal complications and death occurred in 9% and 1% of subtotal gastrectomy patients and in 13% and 2% of total gastrectomy patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis of postoperative events showed that splenectomy or resection of adjacent organs was associated with a twofold risk of postoperative complications. Random surgery and extension of surgery influenced the length of stay. The mean length of stay, adjusted for extension of surgery, was 13.8 days for subtotal gastrectomy and 15.4 days for total gastrectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that subtotal and total gastrectomies, with second-level lymphadenectomy, performed as an elective procedure have a similar postoperative complication rate and surgical outcome. A conclusive long-term evaluation of the two operations and an accurate estimate of the oncologic impact of surgery on long-term survival, not penalized by excess surgical risk of one of the two operations, are consequently feasible</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="997"><COL><DATA> From November 1988 to May 1996, a prospective randomized study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of superselective intra-arterial chemotherapy for surgically proved unresectable gastric carcinoma.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: A previous study of adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy in these cancers by the Gastrointestinal Tract Cancer Cooperative Group of EORTC has been followed by other studies with conflicting results. METHODS: Eligible patients with T1-2N0-1aM0 pancreatic head or T1-3N0-1aM0 periampullary cancer and histologically proven adenocarcinoma were randomized after resection. RESULTS: Between 1987 and 1995, 218 patients were randomized (108 patients in the observation group, 110 patients in the treatment group). Eleven patients were ineligible (five in the observation group and six in the treatment group). Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. One hundred fourteen patients (55%) had pancreatic cancer (54 in the observation group and 60 in the treatment group). In the treatment arm, 21 patients (20%) received no treatment because of postoperative complications or patient refusal. In the treatment group, only minor toxicity was observed. The median duration of survival was 19.0 months for the observation group and 24.5 months in the treatment group (log-rank, p = 0.208). The 2-year survival estimates were 41% and 51 %, respectively. The results when stratifying for tumor location showed a 2-year survival rate of 26% in the observation group and 34% in the treatment group (log-rank, p = 0.099) in pancreatic head cancer; in periampullary cancer, the 2-year survival rate was 63% in the observation group and 67% in the treatment group (log-rank, p = 0.737). No reduction of locoregional recurrence rates was apparent in the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant radiotherapy in combination with 5- fluorouracil is safe and well tolerated.

METHODS: One hundred and seventy-seven patients who previously were untreated for recurrent or metastatic breast carcinoma were entered into the study; 7 patients could not be assessed. The final analysis relates to 85 patients who were treated with FAC and 85 patients who were treated with NA, of whom 21 (25%) and 44 (52%), respectively, had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall response rates were similar for the two treatments and were unaffected by prior exposure to adjuvant therapy; overall response rate (ORR) for FAC was 74% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 65-83%), and the ORR for NA was 75% (95% CI, 66-84%). The activity of NA in patients with liver involvement was greater than that of FAC in terms of survival. Overall survivals were similar, with a median of 17.3 months for patients receiving FAC and 17.8 months for patients receiving NA. Severe toxicity was uncommon with World Health Organization Grade 3-4 neutropenia affecting only 7% of patients in each arm of the study. NA was associated with a higher incidence of mild to moderate constipation, neurotoxicity, and phlebitis, whereas FAC produced a slight excess of mild cardiotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of these two regimens is very similar, although NA may be more active in a subset of patients with visceral metastatic disease, particularly liver involvement. It is clear that, in a direct comparison with an established three-drug regimen, the newer two-drug combination of NA demonstrated equivalent activity with no significant excess of Grade 3-4 toxicity</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1041"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To investigate whether dose escalation of megestrol acetate (MA) improves response rate and survival in comparison with standard doses of MA.

The response rates were 23%, 27%, and 27% for the 160-mg, 800-mg, and 1,600-mg arms, respectively. Response duration correlated inversely with dose. Median durations of response were 17 months, 14 months, and 8 months for the 160-mg, 800-mg, and 1,600-mg arms, respectively. No significant differences in the treatment arms were noted for time to disease progression or for survival; survival medians were 28 months (low dose), 24 months (mid dose) and 29 months (high dose). The most frequent and troublesome toxicity, weight gain, was dose-related, with approximately 20% of patients on the two higher-dose arms reporting weight gain of more than 20% of their prestudy weight, compared with only 2% in the 160-mg dose arm. CONCLUSION: With a median follow-up of 8 years, these results demonstrate no advantage for dose escalation of MA in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1042"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To define the correct time to remove the drain after axillary dissection for carcinoma of the breast. DESIGN: Prospective randomised trial. SETTING: Two public hospitals, Israel. SUBJECTS: 90 women who required axillary dissection for carcinoma of the breast. INTERVENTIONS: 42 were randomised to have the drain removed on postoperative day 3, and 48 to keep the drain in until discharge had decreased to less than 35 ml/24 hours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Formation of seromas or wound infections, need to reinsert the drain, and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS: Early removal of the axillary drain was associated with a significantly higher incidence of seromas (9/42 compared with 2/48, p = 0.02) unless the total amount of fluid drained during the first three postoperative days was less than 250 ml. CONCLUSION: Drains should be removed after axillary dissection only when the daily amount of fluid discharged is low, unless the drainage during the first three days is less than 250 ml</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1048"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND/AIMS: Pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy using the pancreatogastrostomy technique may result in pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and obstruction of the pancreatic duct. A prospective randomized comparison of pancreatogastrostomy and pancreatojejunostomy was therefore performed to assess pathophysiologic changes after pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy. METHODOLOGY: The study population consisted of 23 patients (pancreatogastrostomy: 10, pancreatojejunostomy: 13) who were observed for 2 years. RESULTS: Neither physical condition (dietary intake, body weight, performance status, and frequency of bowel movements) nor nutritional parameters (serum levels of total protein, albumin, total cholesterol, and cholinesterase) differed significantly between the two groups; these parameters recovered to pre-operative levels within 1 year in both groups. Changes in pancreatic function diagnosis (PFD) test results were similar between the two groups. The glucose tolerance test results revealed deterioration of glucose tolerance in 2 patients (20%) in the pancreatogastrostomy group and 3 patients (23%) in the pancreatojejunostomy group. In 2 of 3 patients in each group with non-dilated pancreatic ducts before surgery, the pancreatic ducts dilated after surgery. Diabetes developed after surgery in one such patient in each group. No significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to changes in glucose tolerance test results and the diameter of the pancreatic duct. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective randomized study demonstrates no difference in pathophysiologic changes between patients undergoing pancreatogastrostomy or pancreatojejunostomy after pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy, at least in the first 2 years</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1049"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Pancreaticoduodenectomy, with either gastrectomy (Whipple procedure) or pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD), is a complex procedure. Technical diversity, variation and sampling bias exist among surgeons. Previous reports comparing these two procedures are retrospective and not randomized. These factors should be considered seriously and eliminated in comparisons between the two procedures. METHODS: From August 1994 to August 1997, a prospective randomized comparison was conducted between the Whipple procedure and PPPD performed by the same surgeon with the same approach and same anastomotic fashion for periampullary cancer. After exclusion of seven patients, 31 patients were eligible for the study, 16 receiving PPPD and 15 a Whipple procedure. No significant difference in the age, sex distribution, tumour localization or staging was noted between the two groups. RESULTS: One operative death after PPPD and no operative death after the Whipple procedure resulted in a 3 per cent mortality rate in the 31 patients. Median duration of the Whipple operation was 235 (range 195-305) min, with a median blood loss of 500 (range 230-3100) ml and a median blood transfusion of 0 (range 0-10) units. In the patients who had PPPD, median operating time was 230 (range 170-275) min, median blood loss was 350 (range 100-1200) ml and median blood transfusion was 0 (range 0-4) units. There were two minor leaks from the pancreaticojejunostomy after the Whipple procedure and no leakage after PPPD, resulting in 6 per cent minor leakage in 31 patients. These outcomes were not significantly different. Delayed gastric emptying was observed more frequently after PPPD (six of 16 patients) than after the Whipple procedure (one of 15 patients), with marginal significance (P = 0.08, two-sided Fisher&apos;s exact test). CONCLUSION: In this prospective randomized study, both PPPD and the Whipple procedure were associated with low mortality and operative morbidity rates. There was no significant difference between PPPD and Whipple resection in terms of operative mortality and morbidity, operating time, blood loss and blood transfusion. PPPD was associated with more frequent delayed gastric emptying, although study of more patients is needed to confirm this</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1050"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: According to international guidelines, artificial nutrition may be indicated after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). This clinical study was designed to evaluate whether the route of administration and the composition of the postoperative nutritional support could affect outcome. METHODS: One hundred patients who underwent PD for cancer of the pancreatic head were prospectively studied. Patients were randomized to receive a standard enteral formula (SEN; n = 35) or immunonutrition with an enteral formula enriched with arginine, omega-3 fatty acids, and RNA (IEN group; n = 33), or total parenteral nutrition (TPN; n = 32). Postoperative feeding was started within 12 h after surgery. The three regimens were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous. Tolerance of enteral feeding, rate and severity of postoperative complications, and length of hospital stay (LOS) were evaluated. RESULTS: Full nutritional goal (25 kcal/kg) was achieved in 84% of enterally fed patients versus 96% in the parenteral group (p = NS). The rate of postoperative complications was lower in the IEN group (33%) than in the SEN (40%) and TPN groups (59%). The severity of infectious complications (sepsis score) was lower in the IEN (5.5) than the SEN (7.9) and TPN groups (10.4; p &lt; 0.05). LOS was shorter in the IEN than in the SEN and TPN groups (16.3 vs. 17.8 vs. 19.3 days, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing PD the established nutritional goal can be obtained by enteral feeding.

A prospective randomised study was started to compare safety and activity between CEF and CNF administered using a classical chemotherapeutic schedule in MBC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From December 1987 to June 1993, 151 patients were randomised to receive cyclophosphamide (C) 100 mg m(-2) p.o. days 1-14, fluorouracil (F) 500 mg m(-2) i.v. days 1 and 8, and epirubicin (E) 30 mg m(-2) i.v. days 1 and 8, or mitoxantrone (N) 6 mg m(-2) i.v. days 1 and 8, every 4 weeks. Seventy-three patients were eligible for CEF and 72 for CNF. RESULTS: Objective responses were observed in 61.6% of the CEF group and 44.4% in CNF group (p = 0.004). The median duration of response was 64 weeks in CEF and 50 weeks in CNF group (p = 0.02) and median time to progression was 51 and 33 weeks, respectively (p = 0.0004). At the time of analysis, all except six patients (one in CNF and five in CEF) had died and the median survival time in the CEF group was longer than in CNF (74.4 weeks vs 51.4 weeks; log-rank chi2 test p = 0.015). CNF produced more hematologic toxicity than CEF (WHO scale; grades 2-4); leucopenia 84% vs 68% (p = 0.03) and thrombocytopenia 17% vs 4.5% (p = 0.01); CEF caused more grade 2 and 3 alopecia: 93% vs 70% (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The combination CEF using this schedule and dosage in metastatic breast cancer is more effective with less toxicity than CNF, except for alopecia, and was associated with longer survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1064"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: This paper reports on the clinical relevance of durable static disease (SD) (&gt; or = 24 weeks) in breast cancer patients treated with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients were part of two prospective, randomised, multicentre studies in postmenopausal women with advanced disease in which megestrol acetate was compared with anastrozole 1 mg. Survival from initiation of treatment was analysed by the response type, i.e., complete response (CR)/partial response (PR), static disease (SD) (&gt; or = 24 weeks), or progressive disease (PD), achieved on therapy. RESULTS: Median survival with anastrozole 1 mg was similar between patients who obtained CR/PR and SD (&gt; or = 24 weeks). Similarly, no difference in survival was observed in patients treated with megestrol acetate who achieved CR/PR and SD. With both treatments patients with CR/PR and SD had improved survival over those patients with PD within 24 weeks. There was no difference between treatment arms for patients showing PD within 24 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that durable SD (&gt; or = 24 weeks) is a clinically useful remission criterion in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer with predictive value for overall survival. It also confirms the value of this endpoint with anastrozole, a new generation aromatase inhibitor</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1077"><COL><DATA> Recent studies have concluded that octreotide can prevent complications in patients undergoing pancreatic resections. Given the acquisition cost of octreotide, a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to establish whether if the additional cost associated with its use was justified by a decrease in the consumption of other resources. To evaluate success rates and complication rates, a meta-analysis of double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials was conducted. The rates for pancreatic fistula and fluid collection were 10.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.9 to 13.4) and 3.6% (95% CI 1.9 to 5.2) for octreotide vs. 23.4% (95% CI 19.7 to 27. 1) and 8.8% (95% CI 6.2 to 11.3) for placebo. In a second phase we evaluated the treatment cost for patients with and without complications using two different models of cost savings. In the first model the cost to treat a pancreatic fistula was calculated as the per diem rate (as determined by Statistics Canada) multiplied by the incremental length of stay associated with the complication. In the second model we used data from institutions participating in the Ontario Case Costing Project. In model 1 the estimated incremental length of hospital stay attributed to a pancreatic fistula was 7 days, based on a review of the literature, and the per diem was $552. In model 2 the average cost of care for patients with or without complication was $32,347 (n = 17; 95% CI $20,882 to $43,812) and $11, 169 (n = 18; 95% CI $7558 to $14,779), respectively. The data suggest that when compared to placebo, octreotide is a dominant treatment strategy. In model 1, in a cohort of 100 patients, octreotide saved an average of $853 per patient while allowing 16 incremental patients to avoid complications. In model 2 use of octreotide resulted in an average savings of $1642 per patient while still allowing 16 patients to avoid complications. Detailed one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses suggest that both models were robust. The use of octreotide is a cost-effective strategy in patients undergoing elective pancreatic resection. Consideration should be given to extending its use to patients who are at high risk for development of complications following pancreatic surgery and who do not have any contraindications to the use of this drug</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1079"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: In vitro experimental and animal studies have shown that quinolones reduce the adherence of bacteria on a polyethylene tube and prevent stent blockage. Our aim was to see whether ciprofloxacin prevents stent blockage in patients with malignant stricture of the biliary tract. METHODS: Patients with inoperable biliary or pancreatic tumor not involving the bifurcation of the common hepatic duct were recruited. They were randomized to receive either endoscopic stenting alone or stenting with prophylactic treatment of ciprofloxacin (200 mg i.v. before stenting, followed by 250 mg orally twice per day). In each follow-up visit, clinical symptoms of cholangitis were documented and blood samples taken for blood counts, serum levels of bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. Stent blockage was defined as clinical symptom(s) of cholangitis with biochemical or radiological evidence of stent dysfunction. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were recruited into the study. Three patients in the stenting group and three in the ciprofloxacin group were excluded after randomization. Eleven patients received stenting alone and five patients receiving ciprofloxacin had previous endoscopic stenting. Thirteen patients (50%) in the ciprofloxacin group and eight patients (31%) in the stenting group died before stent blockage. Ten patients (38%) in each group had stent blockage during the follow-up at 20 wk. The median stent patency was 11.6 wk and 11.9 wk in the ciprofloxacin group and the stenting group, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis of stent patency showed no difference between the two groups. Among patients who received endoscopic stenting for the first time, there was a trend favoring ciprofloxacin treatment, but the difference was not significant. The 30- day and 20-wk mortality between the groups were comparable.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 1989 and December 1990, 2,151 patients with Dukes&apos; B (stage II) and Dukes&apos; C (stage III) carcinoma of the colon were entered onto National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowl Project protocol C-04. Patients were randomly assigned to receive FU+LV (weekly regimen), FU + LEV, or the combination of FU+LV+LEV. The average time on study was 86 months. RESULTS: A pairwise comparison between patients treated with FU+LV or FU+LEV disclosed a prolongation in disease-free survival (DFS) in favor of the FU+LV group (65% v 60%; P =.04); there was a small prolongation in overall survival that was of borderline significance (74% v 70%; P =.07). There was no difference in the pairwise comparison between patients who received FU+LV or FU+LV+LEV for either DFS (65% v 64%; P =.67) or overall survival (74% v 73%; P =.99). There was no interaction between Dukes&apos; stage and the effect of treatment. CONCLUSION: In patients with Dukes&apos; B and C carcinoma of the colon, treatment with FU+LV seems to confer a small DFS advantage and a borderline prolongation in overall survival when compared with treatment with FU+LEV. The addition of LEV to FU+LV does not provide any additional benefit over and above that achieved with FU+LV. These findings support the use of adjuvant FU+LV as an acceptable therapeutic standard in patients with Dukes&apos; B and C carcinoma of the colon</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1108"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Bulky stage IB cervical cancers have a poorer prognosis than smaller stage I cervical cancers. For the Gynecologic Oncology Group, we conducted a trial to determine whether weekly infusions of cisplatin during radiotherapy improve progression-free and overall survival among patients with bulky stage IB cervical cancer. METHODS: Women with bulky stage IB cervical cancers (tumor, &gt; or =4 cm in diameter) were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone or in combination with cisplatin (40 mg per square meter of body-surface area once a week for up to six doses; maximal weekly dose, 70 mg), followed in all patients by adjuvant hysterectomy. Women with evidence of lymphadenopathy on computed tomographic scanning or lymphangiography were ineligible unless histologic analysis showed that there was no lymph-node involvement. The cumulative dose of external pelvic and intracavitary radiation was 75 Gy to point A (cervical parametrium) and 55 Gy to point B (pelvic wall). Cisplatin was given during external radiotherapy, and adjuvant hysterectomy was performed three to six weeks later. RESULTS: The relative risks of progression of disease and death among the 183 women assigned to receive radiotherapy and chemotherapy with cisplatin, as compared with the 186 women assigned to receive radiotherapy alone, were 0.51 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.75) and 0.54 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.86), respectively. The rates of both progression-free survival (P&lt;0.001) and overall survival (P=0.008) were significantly higher in the combined-therapy group at four years. In the combined-therapy group there were higher frequencies of transient grade 3 (moderate) and grade 4 (severe) adverse hematologic effects (21 percent, vs. 2 percent in the radiotherapy group) and adverse gastrointestinal effects (14 percent vs. 5 percent).

Women with primary untreated invasive squamous-cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma of the cervix of stage IIB, III, or IVA, without involvement of the para-aortic lymph nodes, were enrolled. The patients had to have a leukocyte count of at least 3000 per cubic millimeter, a platelet count of at least 100,000 per cubic millimeter, a serum creatinine level no higher than 2 mg per deciliter (177 micromol per liter), and adequate hepatic function. All patients received external-beam radiotherapy according to a strict protocol. Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of three chemotherapy regimens: 40 mg of cisplatin per square meter of body-surface area per week for six weeks (group 1); 50 mg of cisplatin per square meter on days 1 and 29, followed by 4 g of fluorouracil per square meter given as a 96-hour infusion on days 1 and 29, and 2 g of oral hydroxyurea per square meter twice weekly for six weeks (group 2); or 3 g of oral hydroxyurea per square meter twice weekly for six weeks (group 3). RESULTS: The analysis included 526 women. The median duration of follow-up was 35 months. Both groups that received cisplatin had a higher rate of progression-free survival than the group that received hydroxyurea alone (P&lt;0.001 for both comparisons). The relative risks of progression of disease or death were 0.57 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.42 to 0.78) in group 1 and 0.55 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.75) in group 2, as compared with group 3.

Between 1990 and 1997, 403 women with advanced cervical cancer confined to the pelvis (stages IIB through IVA or stage IB or IIa with a tumor diameter of at least 5 cm or involvement of pelvic lymph nodes) were randomly assigned to receive either 45 Gy of radiation to the pelvis and para-aortic lymph nodes or 45 Gy of radiation to the pelvis alone plus two cycles of fluorouracil and cisplatin (days 1 through 5 and days 22 through 26 of radiation). Patients were then to receive one or two applications of low-dose-rate intracavitary radiation, with a third cycle of chemotherapy planned for the second intracavitary procedure in the combined-therapy group. RESULTS: Of the 403 eligible patients, 193 in each group could be evaluated. The median duration of follow-up was 43 months. Estimated cumulative rates of survival at five years were 73 percent among patients treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy and 58 percent among patients treated with radiotherapy alone (P=0.004). Cumulative rates of disease-free survival at five years were 67 percent among patients in the combined-therapy group and 40 percent among patients in the radiotherapy group (P&lt;0.001). The rates of both distant metastases (P&lt;0.001) and locoregional recurrences (P&lt;0.001) were significantly higher among patients treated with radiotherapy alone.

METHODS: Two hundred seventy-seven eligible patients were entered with at least two of the following risk factors: &gt;1/3 stromal invasion, capillary lymphatic space involvement, and large clinical tumor diameter. Of 277 patients, 137 were randomized to pelvic radiotherapy (RT) and 140 to no further treatment (NFT). RESULTS: Twenty-one (15%) in the RT group and 39 (28%) in the NFT group had a cancer recurrence, 18 of whom were vaginal/pelvic in the RT and 27 in the NFT group. In the RT group, of 18 (13%) who died, 15 died of cancer. In the NFT group, of the 30 (21%) who died, 25 died from cancer. Life table analysis indicated a statistically significant (47%) reduction in risk of recurrence (relative risk = 0.53, P = 0.008, one-tail) among the RT group, with recurrence-free rates at 2 years of 88% versus 79% for the RT and NFT groups, respectively. Severe or life-threatening (Gynecologic Oncology Group grade 3 or 4) urologic adverse effects occurred in 4 (3.1%) in the RT group and 2 (1.4%) in the NFT group; 3 (2.3%) and 1 (0.7%) hematologic; 4 (3.1%) and 0 gastrointestinal (GI); and 1 (0.8%) and 0 neurologic, respectively. One patient&apos;s death was attributable to grade 4 GI adverse effects.

However, it has not been clearly demonstrated that adjuvant radiation, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both improve the outcome. To evaluate the effect of adjuvant treatment in patients with high-risk cervical cancer after radical hysterectomy, the Austrian Gynecologic Oncology Group conducted a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial between 1989 and 1995. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients with stage IB-IIB cervical cancer treated with radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node metastases and/or vascular invasion randomly received adjuvant chemotherapy (400 mg/m2 carboplatin, and 30 mg bleomycin), standardized external pelvic radiation therapy, or no further treatment. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 4.1 years (range, 2-7) there were no statistically significant differences (P = 0.9530) in disease-free survival among the three treatment arms. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation do not improve survival or recurrence rates in high-risk cervical cancer patients after radical hysterectomy. The most important treatment for these patients seems to be radical abdominal hysterectomy with systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy.

The goals were to determine the superior chemoradiation regimen and to quantitate the relative toxicities. METHODS: All patients had biopsy-proven invasive squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Patients underwent standard clinical staging studies and their tumors were found to be International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics stages IIB, III, or IVA. Negative cytologic washings and para-aortic lymph nodes were required for entry. Patients were randomized to receive either standard whole pelvic RT with concurrent 5-FU infusion and bolus CF or the same RT plus oral HU. RESULTS: Of 388 randomized patients, 368 were eligible; 177 were randomized to CF and 191 to HU. Adverse effects were predominantly hematologic or gastrointestinal in both regimens. Severe or life-threatening leukopenia was more common in the HU group (24%) than in the CF group (4%). The difference in progression-free survival (PFS) was statistically significant in favor of the CF group (P = .033). The sites of progression in the two treatment groups were not substantially different. Survival was significantly better for the patients randomized to CF (P = .018).

However, the confrontation with the results obtained by surgical resection has never been done on an intention-to-treat basis. Between 1989 and 1997, 164 out of 1,265 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were evaluated for surgery. Seventy-seven (48 men, mean 61 years of age, 74 Child-Pugh class A, size 33 +/- 18 mm) were resected (first line option) and 87 (65 men, mean 55 years of age, 50 Child-Pugh class B/C, size 24 +/- 14 mm) were selected for transplantation. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year &quot;intention-to-treat&quot; survival was 85%, 62%, and 51% for resection and 84%, 69%, and 69% for transplantation (8 drop-outs on waiting list). Bilirubin and clinically relevant portal hypertension were independent survival predictors after resection. Thereby, the 5-year survival of the best candidates (absence of clinically relevant portal hypertension, n = 35) was 74%, whereas it was 25% for the worst candidates (portal hypertension and bilirubin &gt;/=1 mg/dL, n = 27) (P &lt;.00001). The variable &quot;drop-out on waiting list&quot; was the sole survival predictor after transplantation. The 2-year survival rate of patients evaluated for transplantation was 84% in the 1989 to 1995 period (mean waiting time, 62 days; no drop-outs) and 54% during 1996 to 1997 (mean waiting time, 162 days; 8 drop-outs)(P &lt;.003). This outcome was significantly lower than that of the best candidates for resection (P =.002).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred sixty-eight patients with metastatic breast cancer, positive and/or unknown estrogen and progesterone receptors, zero or one prior trial of hormonal therapy, and no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease were prospectively randomized into three groups. The groups of patients received either MA 160 mg/d (one tablet per day), MA 800 mg/d (five tablets per day), or MA 1,600 mg/d (10 tablets per day). RESULTS: Patient characteristics were well balanced in the three treatment groups. Three hundred sixty-six patients received treatment and were included in the analyses. The response rates were 23%, 27%, and 27% for the 160-mg, 800-mg, and 1,600-mg arms, respectively. Response duration correlated inversely with dose. Median durations of response were 17 months, 14 months, and 8 months for the 160-mg, 800-mg, and 1,600-mg arms, respectively. No significant differences in the treatment arms were noted for time to disease progression or for survival; survival medians were 28 months (low dose), 24 months (mid dose) and 29 months (high dose). The most frequent and troublesome toxicity, weight gain, was dose-related, with approximately 20% of patients on the two higher-dose arms reporting weight gain of more than 20% of their prestudy weight, compared with only 2% in the 160-mg dose arm.

From January 1964 to January 1968, 737 patients with breast cancer were randomised at the National Cancer Institute in Milan to undergo either Halsted mastectomy or extended mastectomy with internal mammary node dissection. Patients with non-disseminated carcinoma classified as T1, T2, T3, N0, N1 were eligible for the study. No patients received postoperative radiotherapy or systemic therapy. After 30 years of follow-up, the overall survival curves and the specific survival curves do not show any difference between the patients of the two groups. Among the 558 patients who died in the 30 year interval period, 395 (71%) died from breast carcinoma (201 in the Halsted group and 194 in the extended mastectomy group) and 163 from other causes. This study shows that the removal of internal mammary nodes does not improve the survival of patients treated for breast carcinoma. This finding supports the theory that treatment of regional nodes does not influence the survival of cancer patients. The prognostic value of internal mammary node status is, however, high and a biopsy on a selected lymph node should be considered for staging purposes</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1208"><COL><DATA> This open, multicentre, randomized phase II trial was conducted to determine the effect of isolated limb perfusion (ILP) with tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in combination with melphalan with or without interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) in patients with in-transit metastases of melanoma of the limbs (MD Anderson stage IIIA or IIIAB, AJCC stage III). The 64 patients included were randomized to receive either a two- drug regimen consisting of TNFalpha and melphalan (TM-ILP) or a three-drug regimen consisting of TNFalpha, melphalan and INFgamma (TIM-ILP). Patients randomized to receive IFNgamma were pretreated for 2 days before the ILP with once daily 0.2 mg IFNgamma subcutaneously and also received the same amount of IFNgamma during ILP. A total of 47 complete responses (73%) were reported, 22 (69%) of which occurred in the TM-ILP group and 25 (78%) in the TIM-ILP group; the difference was not significant. The 14 partial responses (22%) were split evenly between the treatment groups. In the TM-ILP group, two cases of stable disease and one case of progressive disease were reported. The overall response rate (complete plus partial responses) was 100% in the TIM-ILP group and 91% in the TM-ILP group, yielding an overall response of 95% for this study. In the historical control data, where 103 patients had received melphalan alone (M-ILP), there were 54 records of complete responses (52%) and 80 of complete or partial responses (78%). The median survival time estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 819 days for the TM-ILP group, &gt; 705 days for the TIM-ILP group and 873 days for the combined study population; estimates for time to local progression or recurrence were 327 days, in excess of 498 days and 405 days, respectively. The corresponding figure for the historical controls was 338 days.

Thirty-one French palliative care units agreed to participate in the study and 12 actually recruited at least one patient. To be included, patients had to have an advanced cancer with a surgically inoperable bowel obstruction and to have received no specific anticancer therapy within the preceding 28 days. They had to fulfil at least three of the following criteria: vomiting at least twice a day; colicky abdominal pain; no flatus for 12 h or more; no stool for at least 4 days, faecal impaction being excluded; intestinal distension; air-fluid levels or absence of gas in the colon on an abdominal radiograph. Patients were randomized in three groups to receive either a placebo for 3 days (group A), or methylprednisolone 240 mg daily for 3 days (group B) or methylprednisolone 40 mg daily for 3 days (group C). Symptoms were assessed daily but success or failure of the treatment was assessed on day 4, according to the disappearance or persistence of symptoms. Fifty-eight patients were randomized, of whom 52 were able to be evaluated. Details of symptoms and associated treatments are described below. Of 40 patients without a nasogastric tube, symptoms were relieved in 68% of cases versus 33% among placebo-treated patients (P = 0.047). In 12 patients who had a nasogastric tube already in place, the results are less significant (60% versus 33% with P = 0.080).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 168 patients at 25 treatment centers were enrolled onto this prospective, multicenter, randomized study. The three treatment arms were as follows: (1) fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin (LV) administered via hepatic arterial infusion (HAI), (2) 5-FU/LV administered via intravenous (IV) infusion, and (3) fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR) administered via HAI. RESULTS: Median times to disease progression for the three treatment arms were as follows: 9.2 months for patients treated with HAI 5-FU/LV, 6.6 months for IV 5-FU/LV, and 5.9 months for HAI FUDR. Median survival times for patients treated with HAI 5-FU/LV, IV 5-FU/LV, and HAI FUDR were 18.7 months, 17.6 months, and 12.7 months, respectively. There was a nearly two-fold increase in time to progression in addition to a survival benefit among patients with an intrahepatic tumor burden of less than 25% who were treated with HAI 5-FU/LV. The most common adverse events were stomatitis, nausea and vomiting, skin irritation, diarrhea, and elevated serum levels of liver enzymes. Some patients exhibited severe reactions, including biliary sclerosis and chemical hepatitis. CONCLUSION: Although the use of HAI 5-FU/LV as a means of treating liver metastases after resection of colorectal carcinoma warrants further investigation, it cannot be recommended as a routine therapeutic measure at this time</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="662"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVES: A prospective randomized study was performed to test the hypothesis that tamoxifen might improve the survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to correlate the response of treatment with the expression of hormone receptors. METHODS: One hundred nineteen patients with advanced and otherwise untreatable HCC were included in a placebo-controlled, single-blind trial. The patients were randomized to tamoxifen group (61 patients) and control group (58 patients) and were prescribed with a daily dose of 30 mg of tamoxifen and placebo, respectively. Immunohistochemical tests for estrogen and progesterone receptors were performed on the tumor tissues obtained from 66 patients. All patients were closely monitored and the survival outcome of the two groups of patients was compared and stratified according to the hormonal receptor status. RESULTS: There was no difference in the 1-month mortality rates (32.8% vs. 43.1%, p = 0.246) and the median survival (44 days vs. 41 days, p = 0.703) between the tamoxifen group and the control group. Furthermore, the expression of hormone receptors in the tumors did not affect the survival outcome of the patients treated with tamoxifen. None of the patients who survived longer than 3 months had tumor that had partial response to tamoxifen treatment on follow-up imaging study. CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen has no efficacy in the treatment of patients with advanced HCC and response to treatment was not affected by the expression of hormone receptors</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="663"><COL><DATA> We evaluated the focal therapeutic effect of oily carcinostatic agents administered by transcatheter arterial infusion (TAI) as the initial therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in a randomized controlled clinical trial. Group A (19 patients) received 4 mg of styrene maleic acid neocarzinostatin in 4 ml of Lipiodol, and group B (18 patients) received 100 mg of epirubicin in 4 ml of Lipiodol via the tumor feeding arteries as peripherally as possible. The grade of Lipiodol accumulation and the tumor regression rate were determined 2 weeks after TAI by computerized tomography. Adverse effects within 2 weeks after TAI were evaluated by subjective signs and symptoms such as fever (maximum body temperature) and the frequency of shaking chills and abdominal pain, and by biochemical parameters such as albumin, prothrombin time, and aspartate and alanine aminotransferases. Lipiodol accumulation in the tumor was significantly greater in group A (12/19; 63.2% showing grade IV Lipiodol accumulation) than in group B (3/18; 16.7% showing grade IV) (P&lt;0.05). The tumor regression rate was also significantly greater in group A (8/17; 47.1% showing more than 25% tumor regression) than in group B (1/13; 7.7% showing more than 25% tumor regression) (P&lt;0.05). Although clinically significant elevations of aminotransferases and reductions of cholinesterase, and shaking chills were observed more often in group A than in group B (P&lt;0.0001), these factors had little influence on the clinical outcome. Our results suggest that styrene maleic acid neocarzinostatin in Lipiodol exerts a more favorable focal therapeutic effect than does epirubicin in Lipiodol in the initial treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="664"><COL><DATA> The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the efficacy of interferon alfa-2b (IFN) for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Fifty-eight patients with HCC who were not suitable for resection, transplantation, ethanol injection, or arterial embolization were stratified according to their Okuda stage and randomized to receive IFN (3 x 10(6), 3 times a week, for 1 year) (n = 30) or symptomatic treatment (n = 28). Both groups were identical in terms of age, sex, performance status, presence of constitutional syndrome, Child-Pugh class, Okuda stage, multinodularity, portal thrombosis, and extrahepatic spread. Adhesion to IFN treatment was adequate in 27 patients, with a mean duration of treatment of 8 +/- 3 months. However, IFN treatment was associated with side effects in 23 patients, leading to treatment discontinuation in 13 patients. Two of the 30 patients (6.6%) presented a partial response with greater than 50% size reduction and normalization of alpha-fetoprotein levels. The survival at 1 and 2 years according to intention to treat was not different between the 2 groups (58% and 38% vs. 36% and 12%, respectively, Breslow P =. 19, log rank P =.14) and the absence of difference was maintained when dividing patients according to their Okuda stage. The probability of presenting tumor progression (P =.17), or deterioration of Child-Pugh class (P =.37), performance status (P =. 07), or Okuda stage (P =.44) was not modified by IFN treatment. These results indicate that IFN is not properly tolerated in patients with cirrhosis and advanced HCC and that its administration prompts no benefit in terms of tumor progression rate and survival</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="750"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Stent blockage is a multifactorial process in which stent design and materials, bacteria, proteins, and bile viscosity play a role. AIMS: To compare the patency of the 10 Fr Teflon Tannenbaum (TT) stent to that of the 10 Fr Cotton-Leung (CL) polyethylene stent with sideholes, in patients with malignant obstructive jaundice. METHODS: Patients were recruited to this prospective multicentre randomised study if they had a newly diagnosed malignant bile duct stricture below the hilum of the liver suitable for stenting with a 10 Fr stent. Data were collected and monitored by a professional monitoring company. Primary patency was the interval between stent placement and first exchange or death without recurrent jaundice. RESULTS: 134 consecutive patients were recruited between November 1994 and June 1997; 65 were randomised to the TT stent and 69 to the CL stent. Median patency and 95% confidence intervals were 181 (59, 303) days for the TT stent and 133 (92, 174) days for the CL stent, with no significant difference between the two stents (p=0.49). Median survival and 95% confidence intervals were 115 (71, 159) days for the TT stent and 151 (112, 190) days for the CL stent, with no significant difference between the two stents (p=0.765).

METHODS: Eligible patients were stratified according to tumor thickness, anatomical site, and ulceration, and then prerandomized to either ELND or nodal observation. By using Cox stepwise multivariate regression analysis, the independent predictors of outcome were tumor thickness (P &lt; .001), the presence of tumor ulceration (P &lt; .001), trunk site (P = .003), and patient age more than 60 years (P = .01). RESULTS: Overall 10-year survival was not significantly different for patients who received ELND or nodal observation (77% vs. 73%; P = .12). Among the prospectively stratified subgroups of patients, 10-year survival rates favored those patients with ELND, with a 30% reduction in mortality rate for the 543 patients with nonulcerated melanomas (84% vs. 77%; P = .03), a 30% reduction in mortality rate for the 446 patients with tumor thickness of 1.0 to 2.0 mm (86% vs. 80%; P = .03), and a 27% reduction in mortality rate for 385 patients with limb melanomas (84% vs. 78%; P = .05). Of these subgroups, the presence or absence of ulceration should be the key factor for making treatment recommendations with regard to ELND for patients with intermediate thickness melanomas. CONCLUSIONS: These long-term survival rates from patients treated at 77 institutions demonstrate that ulceration and tumor thickness are dominant predictive factors that should be used in the staging of stages I and II melanomas, and confer a survival advantage for these subgroups of prospectively defined melanoma patients</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="768"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Postoperative radiotherapy for International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage-1 endometrial carcinoma is a subject of controversy due to the low relapse rate and the lack of data from randomised trials. We did a multicentre prospective randomised trial to find whether postoperative pelvic radiotherapy improves locoregional control and survival for patients with stage-1 endometrial carcinoma. METHODS: Patients with stage-1 endometrial carcinoma (grade 1 with deep [&gt; or =50%] myometrial invasion, grade 2 with any invasion, or grade 3 with superficial [&lt;50%] invasion) were enrolled. After total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, without lymphadenectomy, 715 patients from 19 radiation oncology centres were randomised to pelvic radiotherapy (46 Gy) or no further treatment. The primary study endpoints were locoregional recurrence and death, with treatment-related morbidity and survival after relapse as secondary endpoints. FINDINGS: Analysis was done according to the intention-to-treat principle. Of the 715 patients, 714 could be evaluated. The median duration of follow-up was 52 months. 5-year actuarial locoregional recurrence rates were 4% in the radiotherapy group and 14% in the control group (p&lt;0.001). Actuarial 5-year overall survival rates were similar in the two groups: 81% (radiotherapy) and 85% (controls), p=0.31. Endometrial-cancer-related death rates were 9% in the radiotherapy group and 6% in the control group (p=0.37). Treatment-related complications occurred in 25% of radiotherapy patients, and in 6% of the controls (p&lt;0.0001). Two-thirds of the complications were grade 1. Grade 3-4 complications were seen in eight patients, of which seven were in the radiotherapy group (2%). 2-year survival after vaginal recurrence was 79%, in contrast to 21% after pelvic recurrence or distant metastases. Survival after relapse was significantly (p=0.02) better for patients in the control group. Multivariate analysis showed that for locoregional recurrence, radiotherapy and age below 60 years were significant favourable prognostic factors. INTERPRETATION: Postoperative radiotherapy in stage-1 endometrial carcinoma reduces locoregional recurrence but has no impact on overall survival. Radiotherapy increases treatment-related morbidity. Postoperative radiotherapy is not indicated in patients with stage-1 endometrial carcinoma below 60 years and patients with grade-2 tumours with superficial invasion</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="770"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Efficient mechanical bowel preparation has been regarded as essential in preventing postoperative complications of colorectal surgery, but the necessity of bowel cleansing has been disputed recently. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of elective colorectal surgery in patients with or without bowel preparation. METHODS: Altogether, 267 consecutive adult patients admitted for elective open colorectal surgery were randomly assigned either to the bowel preparation group with oral polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution (138 patients) or no preparation group (129 patients). Patients who were unable to drink polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution, those who had had bowel preparation within the previous week, and patients not needing opening of the bowel were excluded. Routine colorectal surgery was undertaken, and infectious and other complications were registered daily. Late complications were checked up one to two months after surgery. RESULTS: No deaths were recorded, and 76 percent of the patients in the polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution group and 81 percent in the unprepared group recovered without complication. Anastomotic leaks occurred in 4 percent of the polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution patients and in 2 percent of the other cases, and other surgical site infections occurred in 6 and 5 percent, respectively. None of the differences was statistically significant. There was no difference in restoration of bowel function. The median postoperative stay was eight days in both groups.

Additionally, we compared conventional (open) intraoperative ultrasonography with bimanual liver palpation to contrast-enhanced computerized tomography in a subset of patients. METHODS: From December 1995 to March 1998, 77 consecutive patients underwent curative (n = 63) or palliative (n = 14) resections for colorectal cancer. All patients undergoing curative resections were randomized to either laparoscopic (n = 34) or conventional (n = 29) surgery after informed consent. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced computerized tomography, diagnostic laparoscopy, and laparoscopic ultrasonography before resection. In those patients who had conventional procedures, intraoperative ultrasonography with bimanual liver palpation was also done. All laparoscopic ultrasonography and intraoperative ultrasonography evaluations were performed by one of two radiologists who were blinded to the CT results. All hepatic segments were scanned using a standardized method. The yield of each modality was calculated using the number of lesions identified by each imaging modality divided by the total number of lesions identified. RESULTS: In 43 of the 77 patients, both the laparoscopic ultrasonography and CT scan were negative for any liver lesions. In 34 patients, a total of 130 lesions were detected by laparoscopic ultrasonography, CT, or both. When compared with laparoscopic ultrasonography, intraoperative ultrasonography with bimanual liver palpation identified one additional metastatic lesion and no additional benign lesions. laparoscopic ultrasonography identified two patients with mets who had negative preoperative contrast-enhanced computerized tomography. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic ultrasonography of the liver at the time of primary resection of colorectal cancer yields more lesions than preoperative contrast-enhanced computerized tomography and should be considered for routine use during laparoscopic oncologic colorectal surgery</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="772"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: A randomized prospective trial was performed to determine the efficacy of preoperative and postoperative adjuvant oral UFT, administered with mitomycin C (MMC) after resection for advanced colorectal cancer.

From May, 1995, 74 consecutive patients with MBC were randomly treated with 6 courses of two FEC regimens containing 60 (60FEC) or 120 (120FEC, supported by primary G-CSF) mg/m2 of EPI. Drugs were administered every 21 days. The QoL was assessed over and after treatment by the EORTC QLQ-C30 (VER 2.0) and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires, compiled by the patient, and the Spitzer&apos;s QL-index, compiled by the physician. The study was prematurely closed in May, 1997, due to RR and QoL data of 4th interim analysis. The delivered EPI DI was 20.0 and 37.9 mg/m2/week in 60- and in 120FEC, respectively.

Recent reports have suggested the efficacy of topical sclerosants at reducing their formation. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial was performed to examine the effect of intraoperatively administered topical tetracycline on the occurrence of postoperative mastectomy seromas. Thirty-two women were randomized to the control arm (normal saline) and 30 women to the tetracycline arm. In the treatment group, 100 ml (2 g) of tetracycline solution was administered topically to the chest wall and skin flaps prior to skin closure. The control group received an equal volume of normal saline. Patients were monitored for the development of postoperative wound seroma. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups regarding total volume of closed suction drainage, numbers of patients leaving hospital with drains in place, or duration of catheter drainage. Seroma formation 2 weeks postoperatively was greater in the tetracycline group than the control group (53% vs. 22%, P = 0.01).

We studied prospectively whether cancer mortality during follow-up in women with previously untreated breast, and pelvic cancer is reduced in those who randomly received LMW heparin (Certoparin) compared to patients given unfractionated heparin (UF heparin) for thrombosis prophylaxis during primary surgery. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial, 160 patients received Certoparin and 164 UF heparin until post-operatively day 7. Survival estimations are based on the outcome data from a subset of 140 LMW heparin - and 147 UF heparin recipients. Long-term survival in the Certoparin group compared to the UF heparin group was significantly improved after 650 days (P=0. 0066) but not thereafter when analysis was performed on all cancer cell types combined. In the probability estimates survival benefit within this time was restricted to patients with pelvic cancer but was not observed in breast cancer. However, in breast cancer patients who received LMW heparin the impact of classical tumor prognostic markers was statistically significant after 1,050 days but not after 650 days. Thus, breast cancer patients with unfavorable prognosis seem to benefit in terms of survival advantage from LMW heparin within the 650 days after surgery. These results suggest that improvement in cancer survival can be achieved after even a short course of treatment with LMWH (compared to UFH) given for DVT prophylaxis in the post-operative period. An effect of UFH on disease outcome is not excluded. Further definitive trials of LMWH vs. placebo for cancer outcome (rather then DVT) using doses and schedules that may be more optimal are indicated </DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="795"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To determine the suitability of a single-layer continuous technique for intestinal anastomosis in a surgical training program. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Several recent reports have advocated the use of a continuous single-layer technique for intestinal anastomosis. Purported advantages include shorter time for construction, lower cost, and perhaps a lower rate of anastomotic leakage. The authors hypothesized that the single-layer continuous anastomosis could be safely introduced into a surgical training program and that it could be performed in less time and at a lower cost than the two-layer interrupted anastomosis. METHODS: The study was conducted during a 3- year period ending September 1999. All adult patients requiring intestinal anastomosis were considered eligible. Patients who required anastomosis to the stomach, duodenum, and rectum were excluded. Patients were also excluded if the surgeon did not believe either technique could be used. Patients were randomly assigned to one- or two- layer techniques. Single-layer anastomoses were performed with a continuous 3-0 polypropylene suture. Two-layer anastomoses were constructed using interrupted 3-0 silk Lembert sutures for the outer layer and a continuous 3-0 polyglycolic acid suture for the inner layer. The time for anastomosis began with the placement of the first stitch and ended when the last stitch was cut. Anastomotic leak was defined as radiographic demonstration of a fistula or nonabsorbable material draining from a wound after oral administration, or visible disruption of the suture line during reexploration. RESULTS: Sixty-five single-layer and 67 two-layer anastomoses were performed. The groups were evenly matched according to age, sex, diagnosis, and location of the anastomosis. Two leaks (3.1%) occurred in the single-layer group and one (1.5%) in the two-layer group. Two abscesses (3.0%) occurred in each group. A mean of 20.8 minutes was required to construct a single- layer anastomosis versus 30.7 minutes for the two-layer technique. Mean length of stay was 7.9 days for single-layer patients and 9.9 days for two-layer patients; this difference did not quite reach statistical significance. Cost of materials was $4.61 for the single-layer technique and $35.38 for the two-layer method. CONCLUSIONS: A single- layer continuous anastomosis can be constructed in significantly less time and with a similar rate of complications compared with the two- layer technique. It also costs less than any other method and can be incorporated into a surgical training program without a significant increase in complications</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="796"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To compare, in 305 patients with advanced metastatic melanoma, temozolomide and dacarbazine (DTIC) in terms of overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS), objective response, and safety, and to assess health-related quality of life (QOL) and pharmacokinetics of both drugs and their metabolite, 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl)imidazole-4-carboximide (MTIC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive either oral temozolomide at a starting dosage of 200 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days every 28 days or intravenous (IV) DTIC at a starting dosage of 250 mg/m(2)/d for 5 days every 21 days. RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat population, median survival time was 7.7 months for patients treated with temozolomide and 6.4 months for those treated with DTIC (hazards ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.52). Median PFS time was significantly longer in the temozolomide-treated group (1.9 months) than in the DTIC-treated group (1.5 months) (P =.012; hazards ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.75). No major difference in drug safety was observed. Temozolomide was well tolerated and produced a noncumulative, transient myelosuppression late in the 28-day cycle. The most common nonhematologic toxicities were mild to moderate nausea and vomiting, which were easily managed. Temozolomide therapy improved health-related QOL; more patients showed improvement or maintenance of physical functioning at week 12. Systemic exposure (area under the curve) to the parent drug and the active metabolite, MTIC, was higher after treatment with oral temozolomide than after IV administration of DTIC. CONCLUSION: Temozolomide demonstrates efficacy equal to that of DTIC and is an oral alternative for patients with advanced metastatic melanoma</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="999"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Surgical or medical castration and antiestrogenic treatment with tamoxifen are common endocrine treatments for premenopausal women with breast cancer. However, tamoxifen therapy induces high levels of plasma estradiol, with unknown long-term effects. In this study, we investigated the effect of combining estrogen suppression with the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist buserelin and estradiol receptor blockade with tamoxifen to determine whether the high estradiol levels induced by tamoxifen could be reduced and whether the antitumor effects would be better. METHODS: In a three-arm, randomized, prospective trial, from 1988 through 1995, a total of 161 premenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer were randomly assigned to treatment with buserelin, tamoxifen, or both. Patients with steroid receptor-negative tumors or with tumors of unknown receptor status who had a disease-free interval of less than 2 years were excluded. The median follow-up was 7.3 years, during which 76% of the patients died, all of breast cancer. Patient and tumor characteristics were well balanced among treatment groups. All P values are from two-sided tests. RESULTS: Combined treatment with buserelin and tamoxifen was superior to treatment with buserelin or tamoxifen alone by objective response rate (48%, 34%, and 28% of patients who could be evaluated, respectively; P =.11 [chi(2) test]), median progression-free survival (9.7 months, 6.3 months, and 5.6 months; P =.03), and overall survival (3.7 years, 2.5 years, and 2.9 years; P =.01). Actuarial 5-year survival percentages were 34.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 20.4%-48.0%), 14.9% (95% CI = 3.9%-25.9%), and 18.4% (95% CI = 7.0%-29.8%), respectively. No differences in antitumor effects were observed between single-agent treatment groups. During combined treatment or treatment with buserelin alone, plasma estradiol levels were suppressed equally; in contrast, during treatment with tamoxifen alone, plasma estradiol levels increased threefold to fourfold over pretreatment levels. CONCLUSION: Combined treatment with buserelin and tamoxifen was more effective and resulted in longer overall survival than treatment with either drug alone</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1000"><COL><DATA> Tumor contamination of autologous peripheral blood stem/progenitor cell grafts occurs in a substantial proportion of high-risk breast cancer patients, and the possibility that such contamination may contribute to relapse has focused attention on methods for removal of the contaminating cells prior to transplantation. One such approach is positive selection of CD34+ cells. A fully automated immunomagnetic cell selection system has recently been introduced to facilitate the positive selection process. A multicenter randomized clinical trial was designed to evaluate the capacity of CD34+ cells isolated using the fully automated system to support prompt hematopoietic reconstitution following high-dose chemotherapy in high-risk breast cancer patients, as well as to assess the safety and tolerability of the CD34+ cell transplants. In recipients of isolated CD34+ cells, the median time to an absolute neutrophil count &gt; or =500/microl was 10 days, a value identical to that observed in patients receiving unfractionated apheresis collections. In the isolated CD34+ cell recipients median time to a platelet count &gt; or =20 000/microl was 12 days, compared with 10 days in the unfractionated cell group. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in median time to neutrophil or platelet engraftment. Infusion of autologous cells was well tolerated by the study groups. There were no inter-group differences in the incidence of infections, need for platelet transfusions, or duration of hospitalization. Isolated CD34+ cells were high in purity and sufficient in number for use in autologous transplantation. The fully automated immunomagnetic cell selection system affords an efficient and time-saving option for isolation of CD34+cells to be used as autologous grafts in high-risk breast cancer patients, and the isolated CD34+ cells support undelayed hematopoietic reconstitution</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1001"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Pivotal trial E1684 of adjuvant high-dose interferon alfa-2b (IFNalpha2b) therapy in high-risk melanoma patients demonstrated a significant relapse-free and overall survival (RFS and OS) benefit compared with observation (Obs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, randomized, three-arm, intergroup trial evaluated the efficacy of high-dose IFNalpha2b (HDI) for 1 year and low-dose IFNalpha2b (LDI) for 2 years versus Obs in high-risk (stage IIB and III) melanoma with RFS and OS end points. RESULTS: A total of 642 patients were enrolled (608 patients eligible), of whom a majority (75%) had nodal metastasis (50% had nodal recurrence). Unlike E1684, E1690 allowed entry of patients with T4 (&gt; 4 mm) deep primary tumors, regardless of nodal dissection, and 25% of the patients entered onto this trial had deep primary tumors (compared with 11% in E1684). At 52 months&apos; median follow-up, HDI demonstrated an RFS benefit exceeding that of LDI compared with Obs. The 5-year estimated RFS rates for the HDI, LDI, and Obs arms were 44%, 40%, and 35%, respectively. The hazards ratio for the intent-to-treat analysis of HDI versus Obs was 1.28 (P(2) =.05); for LDI versus Obs, it was 1.19 (P(2) =.17). By Cox analysis, the impact of HDI on RFS achieved significance (P(2) =.03). The RFS benefit was equivalent for node-negative and node-positive patients. Neither HDI nor LDI has demonstrated an OS benefit compared with Obs at this time. A major improvement in the median OS of patients in the E1690 Obs arm was noted in comparison with E1684 (6 years v 2.8 years). An analysis of salvage therapy for patients who relapsed on E1690 demonstrated that a significantly larger proportion of patients in the Obs arm received IFNalpha-containing salvage therapy compared with the HDI arm; this therapy was unavailable to patients during E1684, and patients with undissected regional nodes were not included in E1684. This study did not specify therapy at recurrence. Analysis of treatments received at recurrence demonstrated significantly more frequent use of IFNalpha2b at relapse from Obs than from HDI, which may have confounded interpretation of the survival benefit of assigned treatments in E1690. CONCLUSION: The results of the intergroup E1690 trial demonstrate an RFS benefit of IFNalpha2b that is dose-dependent and significant for HDI by Cox multivariable analysis</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1004"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the endpoints of complications (specifically pancreatic fistula and total complications) and death in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Four randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials from Europe have evaluated prophylactic octreotide (the long-acting synthetic analog of native somatostatin) in patients undergoing pancreatic resection. Each trial reported significant decreases in overall complication rates, and two of the four reported significantly lowered rates of pancreatic fistula in patients receiving prophylactic octreotide. However, none of these four trials studied only pancreaticoduodenal resections, and all trials had high pancreatic fistula rates (&gt;19%) in the placebo group. A fifth randomized trial from the United States evaluated the use of prophylactic octreotide in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy and found no benefit to the use of octreotide. Prophylactic use of octreotide adds more than $75 to the daily hospital charge in the United States. In calendar year 1996, 288 patients received octreotide on the surgical service at the authors&apos; institution, for total billed charges of $74,652. METHODS: Between February 1998 and February 2000, 383 patients were recruited into this study on the basis of preoperative anticipation of pancreaticoduodenal resection. Patients who gave consent were randomized to saline control versus octreotide 250 &amp;mgr;g subcutaneously every 8 hours for 7 days, to start 1 to 2 hours before surgery. The primary postoperative endpoints were pancreatic fistula, total complications, death, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Two hundred eleven patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with pancreatic-enteric anastomosis, received appropriate saline/octreotide doses, and were available for endpoint analysis. The two groups were comparable with respect to demographics (54% male, median age 66 years), type of pancreaticoduodenal resection (60% pylorus-preserving), type of pancreatic-enteric anastomosis (87% end-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy), and pathologic diagnosis. The pancreatic fistula rates were 9% in the control group and 11% in the octreotide group. The overall complication rates were 34% in the control group and 40% in the octreotide group; the in-hospital death rates were 0% versus 1%, respectively. The median postoperative length of hospital stay was 9 days in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the prophylactic use of perioperative octreotide does not reduce the incidence of pancreatic fistula or total complications after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Prophylactic octreotide use in this setting should be eliminated, at a considerable cost savings</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1056"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of cervical cancer screening in an urgent care clinic. DESIGN: Prospective randomized trial. SETTING: Public teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Women presenting to the urgent care clinic whose evaluation necessitated a pelvic examination were eligible for participation. Women who had a hysterectomy, had a documented Pap test at our institution in the past year, did not speak English or Spanish, or had significant vaginal bleeding were excluded. Women presenting to the gynecology clinic for a scheduled Pap test were used as a comparison group for rates of follow-up, Pap smear adequacy, and Pap smear abnormalities. INTERVENTIONS: Women randomized to the intervention group had a Pap test performed as part of their pelvic examination, while women in the usual care group were encouraged to schedule an appointment in the gynecology clinic at a later date. The women in the two groups completed identical questionnaires regarding cervical cancer risk factors and demographic information. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ninety-four (84.7%) of 111 women in the intervention group received a Pap test, as compared with 25 (29%) of 86 in the usual care group (P &lt;.01). However, only 5 (24%) of 21 women with abnormal Pap smears in the intervention group received follow-up compared with 6 (60%) of 10 women seen during the same time period in the gynecology clinic for self-referred, routine annual examinations (P =.11). Pap smears obtained in the urgent care clinic were similar to those in the gynecology clinic with regard to abnormality rate (22.3% vs 20%; P =.75, respectively) and specimen adequacy (67% vs 72%; P =.54, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Urgent care clinic visits can be used as opportunities to perform Pap test screening in women who are unlikely to adhere to cervical cancer screening recommendations. However, to accrue the full potential benefit from this intervention, an improved process to ensure patient follow-up must be developed</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1058"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The incidence of locoregional recurrences (LR) following radical surgery of rectal cancer varies from 5% to 30% according to the literature. The purpose of this prospective study was to compare the outcome of the Abdomino-Perineal Excision (APE) vs. the Anterior Resection (AR) in a consecutive series of 188 patients who underwent surgery for cure from 1980 to the end of 1992 (81 APE and 107 AR), followed for 5 years, evaluating their influence on the incidence of the recurrences. METHODS: The patients were enrolled at random in the two surgical groups, provided that a radical excision of the tumour, with only two limits: the level of the lesion from the anal verge and the presence of a severe incontinence instrumentally proven. TNM, Dukes staging, grading, and tumour location were statistically evaluated. Further primary suture vs. packing of the perineal wound in APE and handsewn vs. stapled anastomosis in AR were compared in relation with the incidence of LR. RESULTS: The overall local recurrence rate was 19.2% (32/167), in details 19.7% for APE and 18.5% for AR. Similar recurrence rates were observed following both procedures, matching the patients according to the Dukes stage and different details of techniques. A slight statistically significant difference was found as far as the tumour location is concerned in the group treated with anterior resection (p = &lt;0.05) because of the higher recurrence observed in AR performed for tumours of the lower third of the rectum in comparison with the more proximal level. CONCLUSIONS: The AA conclude that the choice of the right surgical procedure in the rectal carcinoma depends on the characteristics of the tumour and the conditions of the patients, provided that the oncologic indications were respected, because recurrence and survival rate are independent from the surgical approaches</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1059"><COL><DATA> OBJECTIVE: To determine whether tumorectomy with tamoxifen in women over 70 years achieves the same treatment results as mastectomy plus tamoxifen. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective randomized analysis of 121 patients over 70 with breast cancer clinically negative axilla and tumor up to 4 cm diameter. Randomization was according to even or odd birth month. Branch A: Madden operation + tamoxifen 20 mg OD (once/day). Branch B: Tumorectomy to disease free margins + tamoxifen 20 mg OD. RESULTS: Survival rate of five years for the Madden operation was 69% and for tumorectomy 71.4% with a mortality from other causes of 23.1%. Survival probability (specific death) at 5 years was of 93.4% for the Madden group and 95.2% for tumorectomy. A significant increase of the mortality was observed in those patients that had recurrences, no matter of treatment given. Specific death cause did not vary with age, but did for other causes, this being significant.

We have assessed the use of a single dose of intravenous antibiotic (Augmentin 1.2 g), given with induction of anaesthesia as prophylaxis, against post-operative wound infection in women undergoing clean, elective breast surgery. Three hundred and thirty-four patients were recruited. Of the 164 receiving antibiotic prophylaxis 29 (17.7%) had wound infections compared with 32 (18.8%) in the placebo group (P=0.79). There were no significant differences in any other post-operative infective complications. Antibiotic prophylaxis is probably not required in clean, elective breast surgery.

Twenty eligible patients with cirrhosis were randomized into two groups: 10 patients treated with 6 million units of natural IFN-beta twice a week for 36 months and 10 patients without IFN therapy. One patient within the treatment group discontinued interferon therapy after 19 months of treatment because of a mild degree of retinopathy. None of the patients in either group lost HCV-RNA until the end of the observation. Although 7 (70.0%) of 10 patients in the nontreatment group showed tumor recurrence, only 1 (10.0%) of 10 patients with IFN therapy developed tumor recurrence during a median observation period of 25.0 months. Cumulative recurrence rates of the treated and untreated groups were 0% and 62.5% at the end of the first year, and 0% and 100% at the second year, respectively (log-rank test, P =.0004).

Among these, omentoplasty (OP) has been employed occasionally but there are no clinical studies that clearly demonstrate its usefulness. METHODS: Of 172 randomized patients undergoing hepatic resection between January 1991 and December 1994, 5 were withdrawn for protocol violation, leaving 167 who were randomly allotted to undergo OP (n = 87) on the hepatic raw surface or not (NO; n = 80). This procedure was performed for malignant tumor in 125 cases, benign tumor in 33, and for other causes in 15. Six patients had more than two types of lesions, and 32 patients had associated cirrhosis. Sixty-five major and 102 minor hepatic resections were performed. The main outcome measures studied were the number of patients with deep abdominal complications (DAC; deep bleeding or hematoma, deep infection, with or without pus discharge through drains, bile leakage), as well as repeat operations and postoperative death. Patients were divided into two strata according to the site of the lesion with respect to the diaphragm: (1) in contact (posterosuperior segments II, VII and VIII) or (2) not in contact (anterior segments III, IV, V, and VI). RESULTS: Both groups were comparable as regards patient demographics, intraoperative procedures, intraoperative search for bile leaks and intraoperative transfusion requirements. Fewer patients had DAC in OP (n = 11) than in NO (n = 15) (difference not significant). Ten patients (6%) required repeat operations: 4 in OP without immediate mortality and 6 in NO, 3 followed by death. One further patient in OP required repeat operation after discharge and died. Four patients died in OP and 7 in NO, 1 and 4 of DAC, respectively (not significant). Deep abdominal complications were significantly associated with major hepatic resection (P &lt;0.05) whereas postoperative death was significantly correlated with cirrhosis (P &lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: OP on the raw surface after hepatic resection lowers the rate of all complications related to DAC (except biliary leaks) and their severity (repeat operations and death) but not significantly so. OP is not recommended as a routine measure to complete elective hepatic resections</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1063"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin (40 mg/m2/cycle), etoposide (360 mg/m2/cycle) and cisplatin (80 mg/m2/cycle) comprise an efficient regimen in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC). However, its excessive hematological toxicity led doctors to avoid using the combination. Doxorubicin is the main cause of myelotoxicity in the EAP regimen. The aim of this study was to compare an eight-hour infusion of doxorubicin (arm A) with intravenous injection of doxorubicin (arm B) in the EAP regimen with respect to toxicity, objective responses, time to progression (TTP) and survival in patients with AGC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One-hundred twenty chemotherapy-naive patients with measurable AGC were randomised between September 1994 and August 1998. Sixty patients in arm A and sixty patients in arm B were considered as fully evaluable. The arms were well balanced for age, sex distribution, previous therapy, histological grade and performance status. One-hundred eighty cycles were applied in arm A (median 2) and 201 in arm B (median 4). RESULTS: No difference was detected (P = 0.28) in the response rate of arm A 20% (CR 3; PR 9; 95% CI: 10-30) and B 28% (CR 3; PR 14; 95% CI: 17-40). But there was a significant difference in PD (P = 0.005) between arm A (51%) and arm B (36%). TTP (P = 0.01) and survival (P = 0.02) analyses detected an advantage for arm B vs. arm A. Grades 3-4 toxicity were as follows (arms A%/B%): anemia 8/10, leukopenia 24/26, thrombocytopenia 6/16 (significance, P = 0.05), nausea/vomiting 5/8, diarrhea 6/2, mucositis 8/5. Apart from the trombocytopenia, there was no significant difference in toxicity grades 3-4 between the two arms. Four treatment-related deaths occurred, two in each arm. CONCLUSIONS: Bolus injection of doxorubicin is superior to eight-hour doxorubicin infusion in the EAP regimen in terms of survival, TTP and PD without being significantly more toxic</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1067"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Pancreaticogastrostomy (PG) after pancreaticoduodenectomy has been reported to have a lower incidence of pancreatic fistula than pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) but this was not confirmed in a recent prospective randomized study. METHODS: Different methods of reconstruction after pancreaticoduodenectomy were used between January 1994 and January 1999 in two university-affiliated hospitals, PJ (n = 69) in one hospital and PG (n = 73) in the other. Operations at both hospitals were performed by the same surgical team. All pancreatic anastomoses were carried out in two layers with pancreatic duct stents. Pancreatic fistula was identified by the presence of more than 1000 units/l of amylase-rich fluid in the drains 7 days or more after operation, by radiography from the pancreatic duct stent and by water-soluble contrast upper gastrointestinal studies. RESULTS: The two groups of patients were similar in terms of age, sex, findings at preoperative assessment, disease status, operative time, intraoperative blood loss and nature of non-tumorous pancreatic tissue. The amylase level in ascites at 7 days after operation was significantly lower after PG than PJ (P = 0.032). The incidence of pancreatic fistula in the PG group (zero) was significantly less than that after PJ (13 per cent) (P = 0.014). Intra-abdominal haemorrhage and intra-abdominal abscess occurred in three (4 per cent) and four patients (6 per cent) respectively, with two hospital deaths (3 per cent) in the PJ group, but these complications did not occur after PG.

Patients completed both the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire and the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL) with six additional items, at baseline and after the third, fifth and seventh cycles of chemotherapy. A significant difference in progression-free survival in favour of doxorubicin caused a bias in the data with differences in expected completion rates of questionnaires beyond cycle three. Therefore, statistical comparisons were performed only for the first three cycles. Baseline compliance was 64% and 61% for the QLQ- C30 and RSCL questionnaires, respectively. Doxorubicin was associated with significantly more nausea/vomiting (P=0.001), loss of appetite (P=0.010) and a greater burden of disease and treatment (P=0.044), but with less bone pain (P=0.042) and rash (P=0.045) than paclitaxel. Both treatments were associated with improved emotional function and reduction in psychological distress at cycle 3. Longitudinal data suggested that doxorubicin was associated with less pain, specifically bone pain. Doxorubicin was more active but may have had more side-effects during the first three cycles.

This phase III study investigated the effect of combining oxaliplatin with LV5FU2, with progression-free survival as the primary end point. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred twenty previously untreated patients with measurable disease were randomized to receive a 2-hour infusion of LV (200 mg/m(2)/d) followed by a 5FU bolus (400 mg/m(2)/d) and 22-hour infusion (600 mg/m(2)/d) for 2 consecutive days every 2 weeks, either alone or together with oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) as a 2-hour infusion on day 1. RESULTS: Patients allocated to oxaliplatin plus LV5FU2 had significantly longer progression-free survival (median, 9.0 v 6.2 months; P =.0003) and better response rate (50.7% v 22.3%; P =.0001) when compared with the control arm. The improvement in overall survival did not reach significance (median, 16.2 v 14.7 months; P =. 12). LV5FU2 plus oxaliplatin gave higher frequencies of National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria grade 3/4 neutropenia (41. 7% v 5.3% of patients), grade 3/4 diarrhea (11.9% v 5.3%), and grade 3 neurosensory toxicity (18.2% v 0%), but this did not result in impairment of quality of life (QoL). Survival without disease progression or deterioration in global health status was longer in patients allocated to oxaliplatin treatment (P =.004).

METHODS: Fifty-seven patients (26 men, mean age 75.5 years) with unresectable malignant tumors and distal biliary stenosis were included (38 pancreatic head cancer, 17 cholangiocarcinoma, 2 ampullary cancer). Patients were prospectively randomized to have a 10F, 7 cm long TB (29 patients) or CH (28 patients) stent inserted endoscopically. Four patients (2 TB and 2 CH) were excluded: 3 because of the failure of stent insertion and 1 because of a protocol violation. The patients were evaluated clinically and, if necessary, with biochemical tests every month until death or until they needed surgery for symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction. When occlusion or dislocation occurred, the stent was replaced with one of the same type. Cumulative stent patency and patient survival were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis and compared by log-rank chi-square test. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable in mean age, gender, and diagnosis. The patients were followed for a mean of 145.5 days (range 24 to 613); by the end of the study 47 patients (81%) had died or developed symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction. Median survival was 88 days (range 24 to 613) in the TB group and 75.6 days (23 to 486) in the CH group. Stent exchange (occlusion 16, dislocation 3) was necessary for 5 patients in the TB group and 7 in the CH group. No statistical difference was found on comparing the mean duration of function of the first, second, and third stents (analysis of variance, p = 0.80). The median duration of stent function was 96 days (range 11 to 613) in the TB group and 75.5 days (range 23 to 323) in the CH group. No significant difference was found in either survival time (p = 0.48) or stent patency (p = 0.12).

Irinotecan prolongs survival in patients with colorectal cancer that is refractory to treatment with fluorouracil and leucovorin. In a multicenter trial, we compared a combination of irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin with bolus doses of fluorouracil and leucovorin as first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. A third group of patients received irinotecan alone. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive irinotecan (125 mg per square meter of body-surface area intravenously), fluorouracil (500 mg per square meter as an intravenous bolus), and leucovorin (20 mg per square meter as an intravenous bolus) weekly for four weeks every six weeks; fluorouracil (425 mg per square meter as an intravenous bolus) and leucovorin (20 mg per square meter as an intravenous bolus) daily for five consecutive days every four weeks; or irinotecan alone (125 mg per square meter intravenously) weekly for four weeks every six weeks. End points included progression-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS: Of 683 patients, 231 were assigned to receive irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin; 226 to receive fluorouracil and leucovorin; and 226 to receive irinotecan alone. In an intention-to- treat analysis, as compared with treatment with fluorouracil and leucovorin, treatment with irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin resulted in significantly longer progression-free survival (median, 7.0 vs. 4.3 months; P=0.004), a higher rate of confirmed response (39 percent vs. 21 percent, P&lt;0.001), and longer overall survival (median, 14.8 vs. 12.6 months; P=0.04). Results for irinotecan alone were similar to those for fluorouracil and leucovorin. Grade 3 (severe) diarrhea was more common during treatment with irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin than during treatment with fluorouracil and leucovorin, but the incidence of grade 4 (life-threatening) diarrhea was similar in the two groups (&lt;8 percent). Grade 3 or 4 mucositis, grade 4 neutropenia, and neutropenic fever were less frequent during treatment with irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin. Adding irinotecan to the regimen of fluorouracil and leucovorin did not compromise the quality of life.

Erythromycin, a safe, inexpensive drug that stimulates intestinal motilin receptors, has previously been shown to accelerate gastric emptying significantly after upper gastrointestinal surgery. We aimed to evaluate the effect of postoperative intravenous erythromycin on postoperative ileus in patients undergoing elective surgery for primary colorectal cancer. METHODS: Between May 1998 and April 1999, 150 patients undergoing primary resection of colon or rectal cancer were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred thirty-four patients completed the study. Patients were excluded if they had extensive metastatic disease, were taking medications known to interact with erythromycin, or if they required an ileostomy. Patients received either 200 mg of intravenous erythromycin or placebo every six hours. Clinical endpoints were recorded and continuous end-points are presented as mean +/- standard deviation. RESULTS: There were no significant complications related to erythromycin. The erythromycin (n = 65) and placebo (n = 69) groups were comparable regarding demographic and operative factors. The erythromycin group had a slightly shorter length of time to passage of flatus (4.1 +/- 1.3 vs. 4.4 +/- 1.1 days; P = 0.03). There was no significant difference between erythromycin and placebo in time to first solid food (5.6 +/- 1.9 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.8 days), time to first bowel movement (5.2 +/- 1.9 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.3 days), or time to discharge from hospital (7.5 +/- 2.0 vs. 7.6 +/- 2.8 days). There was no difference in the rate of clinically significant nausea (26 vs. 26 percent; P = 0.99), vomiting (17 vs. 16 percent; P = 0.88), or nasogastric tube placement (9 vs. 7 percent; P = 0.68).

This study was carried out to address this issue. An additional aim was to determine whether leucovorin (LV)-modulated 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is superior to the combination of 5-FU, semustine, and vincristine (MOF) in men. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients (n = 694) with Dukes&apos; B or C carcinoma of the rectum were enrolled in National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) Protocol R-02 from September 1987 through December 1992 and were followed. They were randomly assigned to receive either postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy alone (n = 348) or chemotherapy with postoperative radiotherapy (n = 346). All female patients (n = 287) received 5-FU plus LV chemotherapy; male patients received either MOF (n = 207) or 5-FU plus LV (n = 200). Primary analyses were carried out by use of a stratified log-rank statistic; P values are two-sided. RESULTS: The average time on study for surviving patients is 93 months as of September 30, 1998. Postoperative radiotherapy resulted in no beneficial effect on disease-free survival (P =.90) or overall survival (P =.89), regardless of which chemotherapy was utilized, although it reduced the cumulative incidence of locoregional relapse from 13% to 8% at 5-year follow-up (P =.02). Male patients who received 5-FU plus LV demonstrated a statistically significant benefit in disease-free survival at 5 years compared with those who received MOF (55% versus 47%; P =.009) but not in 5-year overall survival (65% versus 62%; P =.17). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of postoperative radiation therapy to chemotherapy in Dukes&apos; B and C rectal cancer did not alter the subsequent incidence of distant disease, although there was a reduction in locoregional relapse when compared with chemotherapy alone</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1101"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is a disorder that has become more common since it may manifest as microcalcifications that can be detected by screening mammography. Since selected women with invasive cancer can be treated safely with breast conservation therapy it is paradoxical that total mastectomy has remained the standard treatment for DCIS. We did a randomised phase III clinical trial to investigate the role of radiotherapy after complete local excision of DCIS. METHODS: Between 1986 and 1996, women with clinically or mammographically detected DCIS measuring less than or equal to 5 cm were treated by complete local excision of the lesion and then randomly assigned to either no further treatment (n=503) or to radiotherapy (n=507; 50 Gy in 5 weeks to the whole breast). The median duration of follow-up was 4.25 years (maximum 12.0 years). All analyses were by intention to treat. FINDINGS: 500 patients were followed up in the no further treatment group and 502 in the radiotherapy group. In the no further treatment group 83 women had local recurrence (44 recurrences of DCIS, and 40 invasive breast cancer). In the radiotherapy group 53 women had local recurrences (29 recurrences of DCIS, and 24 invasive breast cancer). The 4-year local relapse-free was 84% in the group treated with local excision alone compared with 91% in the women treated by local excision plus radiotherapy (log rank p=0.005; hazard ratio 0.62). Similar reductions in the risk of invasive (40%, p=0.04) and non-invasive (35%, p=0.06) local recurrence were seen. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy after local excision for DCIS, as compared with local excision alone, reduced the overall number of both invasive and non-invasive recurrences in the ipsilateral breast at a median follow-up of 4.25 years</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1105"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: We conducted a randomized trial in which we compared high- dose chemotherapy plus hematopoietic stem-cell rescue with a prolonged course of monthly conventional-dose chemotherapy in women with metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: Women 18 to 60 years of age who had metastatic breast cancer received four to six cycles of standard combination chemotherapy. Patients who had a complete or partial response to induction chemotherapy were then randomly assigned to receive either a single course of high doses of carboplatin, thiotepa, and cyclophosphamide plus transplantation of autologous hematopoietic stem cells or up to 24 cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil in conventional doses. The primary end point was survival. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 37 months. Of 553 patients who enrolled in the study, 58 had a complete response to induction chemotherapy and 252 had a partial response. Of these, 110 patients were assigned to receive high-dose chemotherapy plus hematopoietic stem cells and 89 were assigned to receive conventional-dose chemotherapy. In an intention-to-treat analysis, we found no significant difference in survival overall at three years between the two treatment groups (32 percent in the transplantation group and 38 percent in the conventional- chemotherapy group). There was no significant difference between the two treatments in the median time to progression of the disease (9.6 months for high-dose chemotherapy plus hematopoietic stem cells and 9.0 months for conventional-dose chemotherapy). CONCLUSIONS: As compared with maintenance chemotherapy in conventional doses, high-dose chemotherapy plus autologous stem-cell transplantation soon after the induction of a complete or partial remission with conventional-dose chemotherapy does not improve survival in women with metastatic breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1146"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: To determine whether the addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CT) to pelvic radiation therapy (RT) will improve the survival of early-stage, high-risk patients with cervical carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with clinical stage IA(2), IB, and IIA carcinoma of the cervix, initially treated with radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy, and who had positive pelvic lymph nodes and/or positive margins and/or microscopic involvement of the parametrium were eligible for this study. Patients were randomized to receive RT or RT + CT. Patients in each group received 49.3 GY RT in 29 fractions to a standard pelvic field. Chemotherapy consisted of bolus cisplatin 70 mg/m(2) and a 96-hour infusion of fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m(2)/d every 3 weeks for four cycles, with the first and second cycles given concurrent to RT. RESULTS: Between 1991 and 1996, 268 patients were entered onto the study. Two hundred forty-three patients were assessable (127 RT + CT patients and 116 RT patients). Progression- free and overall survival are significantly improved in the patients receiving CT. The hazard ratios for progression-free survival and overall survival in the RT only arm versus the RT + CT arm are 2.01 (P =.003) and 1.96 (P =. 007), respectively. The projected progression- free survivals at 4 years is 63% with RT and 80% with RT + CT. The projected overall survival rate at 4 years is 71% with RT and 81% with RT + CT. Grades 3 and 4 hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity were more frequent in the RT + CT group.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, multicenter study evaluated the efficacy of anastrozole 1 mg once daily relative to tamoxifen 20 mg once daily in patients with tumors that were hormone receptor-positive or of unknown receptor status who were eligible for endocrine therapy. The primary end points were time to progression (TTP), objective response (OR), and tolerability. RESULTS: A total of 668 patients (340 in the anastrozole arm and 328 in the tamoxifen arm) were randomized to treatment and followed-up for a median of 19 months. Median TTP was similar for both treatments (8.2 months in patients who received anastrozole and 8.3 months in patients who received tamoxifen). The tamoxifen:anastrozole hazards ratio was 0.99 (lower one-sided 95% confidence limit, 0.86), demonstrating that anastrozole was at least equivalent to tamoxifen. Anastrozole was also as effective as tamoxifen in terms of OR (32.9% of anastrozole and 32.6% of tamoxifen patients achieved a complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]). Clinical benefit (CR + PR + stabilization of &gt; or = 24 weeks) rates were 56.2% and 55.5% for patients receiving anastrozole and tamoxifen, respectively. Both treatments were well tolerated. However, incidences of thromboembolic events and vaginal bleeding were reported in fewer patients treated with anastrozole than with tamoxifen (4.8% v 7.3% [thromboembolic events] and 1.2% v 2.4% [vaginal bleeding], respectively). CONCLUSION: Anastrozole satisfied the predefined criteria for equivalence to tamoxifen. Together with the lower observed incidence of thromboembolic events and vaginal bleeding, these findings indicate that anastrozole should be considered as first-line therapy for postmenopausal women with ABC</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1171"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: The efficacy and tolerability of anastrozole (Arimidex; AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE, and Macclesfield, United Kingdom) and tamoxifen were compared as first-line therapy for advanced breast cancer in 353 postmenopausal women. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The randomized, double-blind, multicenter study was designed to evaluate anastrozole 1 mg once daily relative to tamoxifen 20 mg once daily in patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors or tumors of unknown receptor status who were eligible for endocrine therapy. Primary end points were objective response (OR), defined as complete (CR) or partial (PR) response, time to progression (TTP), and tolerability. RESULTS: Anastrozole was as effective as tamoxifen in terms of OR (21% v 17% of patients, respectively), with clinical benefit (CR + PR + stabilization &gt; or = 24 weeks) observed in 59% of patients on anastrozole and 46% on tamoxifen (two-sided P =.0098, retrospective analysis). Anastrozole had a significant advantage over tamoxifen in terms of TTP (median TTP of 11.1 and 5.6 months for anastrozole and tamoxifen, respectively; two-sided P =.005). The tamoxifen:anastrozole hazards ratio was 1.44 (lower one-sided 95% confidence limit, 1.16). Both treatments were well tolerated. However, thromboembolic events and vaginal bleeding were reported in fewer patients who received anastrozole compared with those who received tamoxifen (4.1% v 8.2% [thromboembolic events] and 1.2% v 3.8% [vaginal bleeding], respectively). CONCLUSION: Anastrozole satisfied the predefined criteria for equivalence to tamoxifen. Furthermore, we observed both a significant increase in TTP and a lower incidence of thromboembolic events and vaginal bleeding with anastrozole. These findings indicate that anastrozole should be considered as first-line therapy for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1180"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Irinotecan is active against colorectal cancer in patients whose disease is refractory to fluorouracil. We investigated the efficacy of these two agents combined for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODS: 387 patients previously untreated with chemotherapy (other than adjuvant) for advanced colorectal cancer were randomly assigned open-label irinotecan plus fluorouracil and calcium folinate (irinotecan group, n=199) or fluorouracil and calcium folinate alone (no-irinotecan group, n=188). Infusion schedules were once weekly or every 2 weeks, and were chosen by each centre. We assessed response rates and time to progression, and also response duration, survival, and quality of life. Analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population and on evaluable patients. FINDINGS: The response rate was significantly higher in patients in the irinotecan group than in those in the no-irinotecan group (49 vs 31%, p&lt;0.001 for evaluable patients, 35 vs 22%, p&lt;0.005 by intention to treat). Time to progression was significantly longer in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group (median 6.7 vs 4.4 months, p&lt;0.001), and overall survival was higher (median 17.4 vs 14.1 months, p=0.031). Some grade 3 and 4 toxic effects were significantly more frequent in the irinotecan group than in the no-irinotecan group, but effects were predictible, reversible, non-cumulative, and manageable. INTERPRETATION: Irinotecan combined with fluorouracil and calcium folinate was well-tolerated and increased response rate, time to progression, and survival, with a later deterioration in quality of life. This combination should be considered as a reference first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1181"><COL><DATA>Purpose:  The present prospective randomized adjuvant trial was carried out to compare the toxicity, feasability and efficacy of augmented chemotherapy added to hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy after wide or marginal resection of grade 2 and 3 soft tiisue sacroma (STS).Patients and methods:  Fifty-nine patients underwent primary surgery by wide or margnal excision and were subsequently randomized to receive radiotherapy alone or under the addition of six courses of ifosfamide (1500 mg/m2, days 1-4), dacarbazine (DTIC) (200 mg/m2, days 1-4) and doxorubicin (25mg/m2, days 1-2) administered in 14 day intervals supported by granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (30X106 IU/day/s.c.) on days 5-13.  According to the randomization protocol, 28 patients recieved radiotherapy only, whereas 31 patients were treated with additional chemotherapy.Results:  The relative ifosfamide-doxorubicin-DTIC (IFADIC) dose intensity achieved was 93%.  After a mean observation period of 41±19.7 months (range 8.1-84 months), 16 patients (57%) in the control group versus 24 patients (77%) in the chemotherapy group were free of disease (p&gt;0.05). Within the control group, tumor relapses occurred in 12 patients (43%; six with distant metastasis, two with local relapse, four with both) versus seven patients (23%; five patients with distant metastasis, one with local recurrence, one with both) from the chemotherapy group.  Relapse free survival (RFS) (p=0.01), time to local failure (TLF) (p=0.09), time to distant failure (TDF) (p=0.17) as well as overall survival (OS) (p=0.4) did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups.  Treatment related toxicity was generally mild in both treatment arms.Conclusion:  We conclude that  the safety profile of intensified IFADIC added to radiotherapy was manageable and tolerable in the current setting.  Inclusion of intensified IFADIC added to radiotherapy was not translated into a significant benefit concerning OS, RFS, TLF,  and TDF as compared with radiotherapy only, although a potential benefit of chemotherapy for grade 3 STS patients needs to be validated in prospective randomized trials including larger patient numbers.</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1183"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Fifty-one patients were operated on during 1988-1992 and randomized after total gastrectomy to one of two reconstruction types. Twenty patients with jejunal pouch reconstruction and 14 patients with Roux-en-Y reconstruction (67% of all) survived at least 3 years after total gastrectomy. We studied symptoms, eating capacity, and nutrition in these patients during the clinical follow-up; 21 patients were assessed by mail questionnaire 8 years after total gastrectomy. METHODS: Postoperative symptoms, number of meals, and eating capacity were assessed by standard questionnaire during 3 years&apos; follow-up. Weight loss and nutritional laboratory variables were measured, and upper intestinal endoscopy with biopsy was performed during the follow- up. Eight years after the operation symptoms, ability to eat, and number of meals consumed were studied by means of a mail questionnaire. RESULTS: Three years postoperatively dumping (64% compared with 10%, P &lt; 0.05) and early satiety (86% compared with 5%, P &lt; 0.05) were commoner in the Roux-en-Y group. In the pouch group eating capacity was better (96% of normal compared with 67%, P &lt; 0.05), and the patients ate fewer meals per day (mean, 2.7 versus 5.3, P &lt; 0.05) at 3 years. Mean weight loss at 3 years was 9.9 kg in the Roux-en-Y group compared with 1.5 kg in the pouch group (P &lt; 0.05). 25 (OH) vitamin D concentration tended to be higher in the pouch group (47.3 nmol/l compared with 33.9 nmol/l). In the Roux-en-Y group serum alkaline phosphatase activity increased significantly during the 3 postoperative years (from mean 163 U/l to 248 U/l, P &lt; 0.01) and tended to be higher (248 U/l compared with 216 U/l in the pouch group). None of the patients developed oesophagitis or pouchitis during the follow-up. One patient developed a bezoar in the pouch 5 years after gastrectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Pouch reconstruction after total gastrectomy is associated with diminished postoperative symptoms, better eating capacity, and decreased weight loss compared with Roux-en-Y reconstruction. Jejunal pouch reconstruction is thus the recommended surgical method after total gastrectomy</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1185"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Phase II studies have shown primary (neo-adjuvant) chemotherapy with bleomycin, ifosfamide and cisplatin (BIP) is active against inoperable cervical cancer. We present here results of a randomised phase III multicentre trial comparing radical radiotherapy with neo-adjuvant BIP chemotherapy followed by radical radiotherapy in patients with inoperable cervical cancer, designed to discover whether this combination might improve survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with inoperable cervical carcinoma were randomised to pelvic radiotherapy alone [RT] or two to three cycles of bleomycin 30 units/24- hour infusion, ifosfamide 5 g/m2/24 hours, and cisplatin 50 mg/m2) chemotherapy followed by pelvic radiotherapy (BIP + RT). Randomisation was stratified by stage and radiotherapy centre. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-two eligible women were randomised into this trial; eighty-six to RT and eighty-six to BIP + RT. A total of 190 cycles of chemotherapy were given. Median follow-up for the 47 patients still alive is 9 years with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Complete or partial response occurred in 51 of 86 (59%) of those randomised to RT and 60 of 86 (69%) of those randomised to BIP + RT. The difference between response rates does not reach statistical significance (chi2 = 2.06, P = 0.15). Median survival is two years with an actuarial survival at five years of 32% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 25%-39%).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The first 899 patients (toremifene, n = 459; tamoxifen, n = 440) of the total of 1,480 patients accrued to the trial were included in this scheduled safety analysis. The mean follow-up time was 3.4 years. RESULTS: The two treatment groups were well balanced with respect to patient and disease characteristics. The subjective side-effect profile was similar in both treatment groups. Slightly more vascular complications (deep vein thromboses, cerebrovascular events, and pulmonary embolisms) were seen among tamoxifen-treated patients (5.9%) as compared with toremifene-treated patients (3.5%) (P: =.11), whereas bone fractures (P: =.09) and vaginal leukorrhea (P: =.05) were more common in the toremifene group. The number of subsequent second cancers was similar. The breast cancer recurrence rate was 23.1% (n = 106) in the toremifene group and 26.1% (n = 115) in the tamoxifen group (P: =.31). When only patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cancer were considered (n = 556), the risk for breast cancer recurrence was nonsignificantly lower among the toremifene-treated women, with a hazards ratio of 0.74 (90% confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.04; P: =.14). The mean time to breast cancer recurrence and overall survival were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: The side-effect profile of toremifene resembles that of tamoxifen. The efficacy of toremifene seems to be no less than that of tamoxifen. The trend for fewer breast cancer recurrences in the ER- positive subgroup is encouraging, but a longer follow-up is needed to confirm this</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1187"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND/AIMS: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and toxicity profiles of weekly intravenous (i.v.) bolus injection of 5- fluorouracil plus low-dose leucovorin with the Mayo Clinics&apos; monthly 5- day schedule of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. METHODOLOGY: A total of 96 patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer were randomized to receive either a weekly i.v. bolus injection of 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 plus leucovorin 20 mg/m2 (weekly arm), or i.v. bolus injection of 5-fluorouracil 425 mg/m2 plus leucovorin 20 mg/m2 for 5 consecutive days every 4 or 5 weeks (monthly arm). Therapy was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity appeared. In the presence of disease progression, the study regimen was stopped and second-line treatment was instituted after the patient was discontinued from this study. RESULTS: There was no significant difference of response rates between both regimens. The response rate were 14.3% in the weekly arm (2 CR and 5 PR, 95% CI: 2.6-25.2%) and 10.6% in the monthly arm (1 CR and 4 PR; 95% CI: 6.5-32.3%), respectively (P = 0.8957). The survival times were also similar between the two (P = 0.4207, log-rank test). The median survival were 15.8 months in the monthly arm and 18.4 months in the weekly arm. Hematologic toxicity was minimal in both arms. However, the monthly arm produced a higher toxicity in severe (grade 3- 4) diarrhea (14.9% vs. 2%; P = 0.029) and stomatitis (8.5% vs. 0; P = 0.054). CONCLUSIONS: Weekly bolus injection of 5-fluorouracil and low- dose leucovorin achieved a similar response rate and survival as compared with the Mayo Clinics&apos; monthly 5-day schedule, but severe toxicity was less commonly seen using the weekly regimen. As current chemotherapeutic treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer is largely palliative rather than curative, the weekly bolus regimen may be a more favorable approach in managing metastatic colorectal cancer</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1188"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: The role of laparoscopic colon resection in the management of colon cancer is unclear.

Gunji et al. showed better survival and fewer complications with autologous blood clot as compared with gelfoam used for embolization. Our aim was to compare the effect of blood clot versus gelfoam. METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized trial in 100 patients with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma, and compared the side effects and cumulative survival in the two groups. Cox&apos;s proportional hazard model was used to study the prognostic factors. RESULTS: The diameter of the main tumor was 7.9+/-4.6 cm. Our study did not show additional beneficial effects of blood clot. The proportion of side effects was similar and the common ones included fever, pain and vomiting. Though the hepatic artery remained patent for a longer period with blood clot (p=0.061), there was no difference in survival (p=0.129 for Okuda I disease and p=0.388 for Okuda II disease). Subgroup analysis showed longer survival in patients with vascular occlusion (p=0.034 for Okuda I and p=0.029 for Okuda II disease). The independent factors of survival were sex, Child&apos;s class, Okuda stage, tumor type and presence of metastases. CONCLUSION: This study showed no additional benefits of blood clot in patients with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma, in Okuda I and II disease. The longer survival in patients with vascular occlusion suggested that the damage to normal liver tissue by planned periodic transarterial chemoembolization may outweigh its benefit in later sessions of repeated TACE in certain patients</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1192"><COL><DATA> AIMS: Anthracyclines-taxanes containing regimens are widely used for breast cancer treatment both in neoadjuvant-adjuvant setting and in metastatic disease. Recently high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous stem cell support has been introduced as adjuvant treatment for high-risk primary breast cancer and for selected subsets of women with metastatic disease. Therefore, salvage treatment for previously treated patients with progressive disease becomes even more problematic. A regimen of continuous infusion of fluorouracil (FU) and vinorelbine (VNR) has been evaluated in heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight women, median age 52 years, with previously treated breast cancer entered the study. All but one received more than one line of prior systemic chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Furthermore 14 women had undergone HDC with peripheral blood progenitor cells transplantation in adjuvant setting (6 pts), or metastatic disease (8 pts). Treatment consisted of four-day infusion of FU (1000 mg/m2/day) plus VNR (20 mg/m2/i.v. day 1 and 5), recycled every 3 weeks for a total of six courses. Drugs administration was discontinued for G4 toxicity, tumor progression or patient&apos;s refusal. RESULTS: Twenty PR and four CR for an overall response rate of 50% (95%C.I. 36-64%) were recorded. The therapeutic efficacy of the tested regimen was documented both in patients unresponsive to previous anthracyclines-taxanes combinations and in those relapsing after HDC. The median duration of response was 9 months and median survival 16 months. One third of patients experienced Grade-3 stomatitis-mucositis, hematological toxicity was mild and no cardiac toxicity was observed. Twenty-five women (52%) suffered from infusion-related phlebitis (in half of patients a central venous device was necessary at some point of the treatment program). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of FU infusion and VNR i.v. is an effective salvage treatment for heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients, and may represent a valid alternative when other cytotoxic regimens are not feasible</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1193"><COL><DATA> The aim of our single-center, prospective, randomized, open study was to evaluate the antiemetic efficacy and tolerability of a regimen based on a single oral dose of ondansetron 8 mg in comparison with a metoclopramide-based regimen, for prevention of acute FAC (fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy-induced emesis. A total of 149 chemotherapy-naive, female outpatients, under 50 years of age and with no history of alcohol consumption, scheduled to receive their first cycle of FAC chemotherapy, were included. The patients received either oral ondansetron (8 mg) or metoclopramide (1.5 mg/kg, i.v.), both combined with dexamethasone (16 mg, i.v.) and alprazolam (0.5 mg t.i.d. orally). No antiemetic prophylaxis was given for delayed emesis. Complete control of acute vomiting was obtained in 69/74 (93%) of patients receiving ondansetron, and in 49/75 (65%) of those receiving metoclopramide (p=0.00003). Complete control of acute nausea was obtained in 58% of patients receiving ondansetron and in 36% of those receiving metoclopramide (p=0.007). Complete prevention of delayed vomiting/nausea was achieved in 73%/20% and 60%/16% of patients, respectively. Sedation was more frequent in the metoclopramide arm (p=0.04). As far as we know this is the first study that supports the efficacy of a regimen based on a single oral dose of ondansetron 8 mg in the prevention of acute FAC chemotherapy-induced emesis. The ondansetron regimen was highly effective in female patients and was superior to the metoclopramide based regimen</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1194"><COL><DATA> Between March 1990 and May 1993 seventy three patients with previously untreated breast cancer, Stage III or IV without osseal metastases were randomized to sodium clodronate 1600 mg daily p.o.(arm A = 37 patients) or placebo (arm B = 36 patients) over 2 years, additionally to standard therapy. Ten patients were not evaluable for response because of short duration of therapy (less than 2 months). Bone metastases developed in 30% of patients in arm A and 23% patients in arm B.

The aim of this prospective randomised study is to test whether or not different kinds of epidural analgesia (Group A: morphine 0.0017 mg/kg/h and bupivacaine 0.125%-0.058 mg/kg/h; Group B: morphine alone 0.035 mg/kg/12h in the postoperative period) allow earlier postoperative enteral feeding, enhance intestinal motility a passage of flatus and help avoid complications, such as nausea, vomiting, ileus, diarrhoea, pneumonia or other infective diseases. We included in the study 60 patients (28 males and 32 females) with a mean age of 61.2 years (range 50-70) and with an ASA score of 2 or 3. All patients had hepato-biliary-pancreatic neoplasm and were candidates for major surgery. We compared two different pharmacological approaches, i.e., morphine plus bupivacaine (30 patients, Group A) versus morphine alone (30 patients, Group B). Each medication was administered by means of a thoracic epidural catheter for the control of postoperative pain. In the postoperative course we recorded every 6 hours peristaltic activity. We also noted morbidity (pneumonia, wound sepsis) and mortality. Effective peristalsis was present in all patients in Group A within the first six postoperative hours; in Group B, after 30 hours. Six patients in Group A had bowel motions in the first postoperative day, 11 in the second day, 10 in the third day and 3 in fourth day, while in Group B none in the first day, two in the second, 7 in the third, 15 in the fourth, and 6 in the fifth: the difference between the two groups was significant (p&lt;0.05 in 1st, 2nd, 4th and 5th days). Pneumonia occurred in 2 patients of Group A, and in 10 of Group B (p &lt; 0.05).

However, evidence of its efficacy, over the long term, in patients with tumors larger than 2 cm is limited. From May 1980 to May 1986, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer carried out a randomized, multicenter trial comparing BCT with modified radical mastectomy for patients with tumors up to 5 cm. In this analysis, we investigated whether the treatments resulted in different overall survival, time to distant metastasis, or time to locoregional recurrence. METHODS: Of 868 eligible breast cancer patients randomly assigned to the BCT arm or to the modified radical mastectomy arm, 80% had a tumor of 2.1-5 cm. BCT comprised lumpectomy with an attempted margin of 1 cm of healthy tissue and complete axillary clearance, followed by radiotherapy to the breast and a supplementary dose to the tumor bed. The median follow-up was 13.4 years. All P values are two- sided. RESULTS: At 10 years, there was no difference between the two groups in overall survival (66% for the mastectomy patients and 65% for the BCT patients; P =.11) or in their distant metastasis-free rates (66% for the mastectomy patients and 61% for the BCT patients; P =.24). The rate of locoregional recurrence (occurring before or at the same time as distant metastasis) at 10 years did show a statistically significant difference (12% of the mastectomy and 20% of the BCT patients; P =. 01).

Previous trials failed to detect a difference in survival that results from its use. A systematic review of randomized trials that examine the effectiveness of locoregional radiation therapy in patients treated by definitive surgery and adjuvant systemic therapy was conducted. METHODS: Randomized trials published between 1967 and 1999 were identified through MEDLINE database, CancerLit database, and reference lists of relevant articles. Relevant data was abstracted. The results of randomized trials were pooled using meta-analyses to estimate the effect of treatment on any recurrence, locoregional recurrence, and mortality. RESULTS: Eighteen trials that involved a total of 6,367 patients were identified. Most trials included both pre- and postmenopausal women with node-positive breast cancer treated with modified radical mastectomy. The type of systemic therapy received, sites irradiated, techniques used, and doses of radiation delivered varied between trials. Data on toxicity were infrequently reported. Radiation was shown to reduce the risk of any recurrence (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.83), local recurrence (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.34), and mortality (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.94). CONCLUSION: Locoregional radiation after surgery in patients treated with systemic therapy reduced mortality. Several questions remain on how these results should be translated into current-day clinical practice</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1207"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: The long-term effects of radiotherapy on mortality from breast cancer and other causes remain uncertain. METHODS: A meta- analysis was done of 10-year and 20-year results from 40 unconfounded randomised trials of radiotherapy for early breast cancer. It involved central review of individual patients&apos; data on recurrence and cause- specific mortality from 20000 women, half with &quot;node-positive&quot; disease. Radiotherapy fields generally included not only chest wall (or breast) but also axillary, supraclavicular, and internal mammary nodes. FINDINGS: A reduction of approximately two-thirds in local recurrence was seen in all trials, largely independent of the type of patient or type of radiotherapy (8.8% vs 27.2% local recurrence by year 10). Hence, to assess effects on breast cancer mortality of substantially better local control, results from all trials were combined. Breast cancer mortality was reduced (2p=0.0001) but other, particularly vascular, mortality was increased (2p=0.0003), and overall 20-year survival was 37.1% with radiotherapy versus 35.9% control (2p=0.06). There was little effect on early deaths, but logrank analyses of later deaths indicate that, on average after year 2, radiotherapy reduced annual mortality rates from breast cancer by 13.2% (SE 2.5) but increased those from other causes by 21.2% (SE 5.4). Nodal status, age, and decade of follow-up strongly affected the ratio of breast cancer mortality to other mortality, and hence affected the ratio of absolute benefit to absolute hazard from these proportional changes in mortality. INTERPRETATION: Radiotherapy regimens able to produce the two-thirds reduction in local recurrence seen in these trials, but without long-term hazard, would be expected to produce an absolute increase in 20-year survival of about 2-4% (except for women at particularly low risk of local recurrence). The average hazard seen in these trials would, however, reduce this 20-year survival benefit in young women and reverse it in older women</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1172"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Adjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma is controversial because previous trials reported conflicting results.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients between 18 and 65 years of age with grade 3 to 4 spindle-cell sarcomas (primary diameter &gt;/= 5 cm or any size recurrent tumor) in extremities or girdles were eligible. Stratification was by primary versus recurrent tumors and by tumor diameter greater than or equal to 10 cm versus less than 10 cm. One hundred four patients were randomized, 51 to the control group and 53 to the treatment group (five cycles of 4&apos;-epidoxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) days 1 and 2 and ifosfamide 1.8 g/m(2) days 1 through 5, with hydration, mesna, and granulocyte colony- stimulating factor). RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 59 months, 60 patients had relapsed and 48 died (28 and 20 in the treatment arm and 32 and 28 in the control arm, respectively). The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 48 months in the treatment group and 16 months in the control group (P: =.04); and the median overall survival (OS) was 75 months for treated and 46 months for untreated patients (P: =.03).

METHODS: Two-hundred forty-three patients with cervical carcinoma (FIGO stages IB and IIa) were enrolled in a prospective randomized study comparing two types of radical hysterectomy (Piver-Rutledge-Smith class II and class III) between April 1987 and December 1993, and 238 are evaluable. Disease-free survival, overall survival, pattern of recurrences, and morbidity were the endpoints of this study. RESULTS: Mean operative time was significantly (P = 0. 05) shorter in the group of patients undergoing class II hysterectomy (135 min vs 180 min), whereas mean blood loss (530 ml vs 580 ml) and number of patients requiring transfusions (35% vs 43%) were similar in the two arms of treatment. Complications unrelated to the extent of the surgical dissection and mean postoperative stay were similar in the two arms of treatment. Late morbidity was significantly lower in patients in the class II arm (especially urologic morbidity, 13% vs 28%). Postoperative radiotherapy was administered to 64 patients (54%) in class II and to 65 patients (55%) in the class III arm. Recurrence rate (24% class II vs 26% class III) and number of patients dead of disease (18% class II vs 20% class III) were not significantly different in the two groups of treatment. Overall 5-year survival was 81 and 77% and disease-free survival was 75 and 73%, respectively. Multivariate analysis confirms that survival does not depend on the type of operation. CONCLUSIONS: Class II and class III radical hysterectomies are equally effective in surgical treatment of cervical carcinoma, but the former is associated with a lesser degree of late complications</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="1209"><COL><DATA> PURPOSE: Adjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma is controversial because previous trials reported conflicting results.

The ACM group had 44 patients, who received 20 mg/m2 ADM i.v. on days 1 and 8, 100 mg CPA p.o. on days 1-14 and 1200 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) p.o. daily. The treatment was repeated every 28 days until there was evidence of progressive disease or until the full ADM dose (550 mg/m2) had been given. The following 9 hematologic parameters were measured every 4 weeks: alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor plasmin complex (PIC), anti-thrombin-III (AT-III), D-dimer (Dd), fibrinogen (Fg), plasminogen (Pg), protein C (PC), thrombin-antithrombin-III complex (TAT-III), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), and factor X (FX).

To assess prospectively the impact on survival and health-related quality of life of two follow-up protocols in patients with early breast cancer. DESIGN. Randomized controlled clinical trial. SETTING. Multicenter study involving 26 general hospitals in Italy. PATIENTS. A consecutive sample of 1320 women younger than 70 years with stage I, II, and III unilateral primary breast cancer. INTERVENTION. Patients were randomly assigned to an intensive surveillance, which included physician visits and performance of bone scan, liver echography, chest roentgenography, and laboratory tests at predefined intervals (n = 655), or to a control regimen (n = 665), in which patients were seen by their physicians at the same frequency but only clinically indicated tests were performed. Both groups received a yearly mammogram aimed at detecting contralateral breast cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. Primary end points were overall survival and health-related quality of life. RESULTS. Compliance to the two follow-up protocols was more than 80%. At a median follow-up of 71 months, no difference was apparent in overall survival with 132 deaths (20%) in the intensive group and 122 deaths (18%) in the control group. No significant differences were apparent in time to detection of recurrence between the two groups. Measurements of health-related quality of life (ie, overall health and quality-of-life perception, emotional well-being, body image, social functioning, symptoms, and satisfaction with care) at 6, 12, 24, and 60 months of follow-up did not show differences by type of care received.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Between 25% and 75% of patients with periampullary cancer who undergo exploratory surgery with intent to perform a pancreaticoduodenectomy are found to have unresectable disease. Most will undergo a biliary-enteric bypass. Whether or not to perform a prophylactic gastrojejunostomy remains unresolved. Retrospective reviews of surgical series and prospective randomized trials of endoscopic palliation have demonstrated that late gastric outlet obstruction, requiring a gastrojejunostomy, develops in 10% to 20% of patients with unresectable periampullary cancer. METHODS: Between May 1994 and October 1998, 194 patients with a periampullary malignancy underwent exploratory surgery with the purpose of performing a pancreaticoduodenectomy and were found to have unresectable disease. On the basis of preoperative symptoms, radiologic studies, or surgical findings, the surgeon determined that gastric outlet obstruction was a significant risk in 107 and performed a gastrojejunostomy. The remaining 87 patients were thought by the surgeon not to be at significant risk for duodenal obstruction and were randomized to receive either a prophylactic retrocolic gastrojejunostomy or no gastrojejunostomy. Short- and long-term outcomes were determined in all patients. RESULTS: Of the 87 patients randomized, 44 patients underwent a retrocolic gastrojejunostomy and 43 did not undergo a gastric bypass. The two groups were similar with respect to age, gender, procedure performed (excluding gastrojejunostomy), and surgical findings. There were no postoperative deaths in either group, and the postoperative morbidity rates were comparable (gastrojejunostomy 32%, no gastrojejunostomy 33%). The postoperative length of stay was 8.5+/-0.5 days for the gastrojejunostomy group and 8.0+/-0.5 days for the no gastrojejunostomy group. Mean survival among those who received a prophylactic gastrojejunostomy was 8.3 months, and during that interval gastric outlet obstruction developed in none of the 44 patients. Mean survival among those who did not have a prophylactic gastrojejunostomy was 8.3 months. In 8 of those 43 patients (19%), late gastric outlet obstruction developed, requiring therapeutic intervention (gastrojejunostomy 7 patients, endoscopic duodenal stent 1 patient; p &lt; 0.01). The median time between initial exploration and therapeutic intervention was 2 months. CONCLUSION: The results from this prospective, randomized trial demonstrate that prophylactic gastrojejunostomy significantly decreases the incidence of late gastric outlet obstruction. The performance of a prophylactic retrocolic gastrojejunostomy at the initial surgical procedure does not increase the incidence of postoperative complications or extend the length of stay. A retrocolic gastrojejunostomy should be performed routinely when a patient is undergoing surgical palliation for unresectable periampullary carcinoma</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="756"><COL><DATA> Sixty patients in whom a biliary endoprosthesis was inserted were randomized to receive: (1) placebo, (2) aspirin, or (3) doxycycline, to study the effect on the process of sludge formation. After 2 months all endoprostheses were changed, and the amount and composition of the sludge in the patent stents was analyzed. Half of the patients dropped out. The major component (56%) of the sludge of all groups was protein. No insoluble residue was present. Major deposits of sludge were found at irregularities in the stent wall (side flaps). Both doxycycline and aspirin reduced the dry weight of the sludge. Doxycycline significantly reduced the amount of protein, but scanning electron microscopy still showed abundant bacterial growth. Aspirin reduced the content of all sludge components including protein, suggesting that it decreases &quot;stickiness&quot; of bile. Surprisingly, doxycycline significantly decreased the death rate in the 2 months of the study. We present further evidence for a primary role of protein deposition in the early stages of stent occlusion. This process can be partly inhibited by doxycycline and probably also by aspirin, which could lead to a significant increase in stent patency</DATA></COL></ROW><ROW MODID="0" RECORDID="533"><COL><DATA> BACKGROUND: Individually, randomised trials have not shown conclusively whether adjuvant chemotherapy benefits adult patients with localised resectable soft-tissue sarcoma. METHODS: A quantitative meta-analysis of updated data from individual patients from all available randomised trials was carried out to assess whether adjuvant chemotherapy improves overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and local and distant recurrence-free intervals (RFI) and whether chemotherapy is differentially effective in patients defined by age, sex, disease status at randomisation, disease site, histology, grade, tumour size, extent of resection, and use of radiotherapy. FINDINGS: 1568 patients from 14 trials of doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy were included (median follow-up 9.4 years). Hazard ratios of 0.73 (95% CI 0.56-0.94, p = 0.016) for local RFI, 0.70 (0.57-0.85, p = 0.0003) for distant RFI, and 0.75 (0.64-0.87, p = 0.0001) for overall recurrence-free survival, correspond to absolute benefits from adjuvant chemotherapy of 6% (95% CI 1-10), 10% (5-15), and 10% (5-15), respectively, at 10 years. For overall survival the hazard ratio of 0.89 (0.76-1.03) was not significant (p = 0.12), but represents an absolute benefit of 4% (1-9) at 10 years. These results were not affected by prespecified changes in the groups of patients analysed. There was no consistent evidence that the relative effect of adjuvant chemotherapy differed for any subgroup of patients for any endpoint. However, the best evidence of an effect of adjuvant chemotherapy for survival was seen in patients with sarcomas of the extremities. INTERPRETATION: The meta-analysis provides evidence that adjuvant doxorubicin-based chemotherapy significantly improves the time to local and distant recurrence and overall recurrence-free survival. There is a trend towards improved overall survival</DATA></COL></ROW></RESULTSET></FMPXMLRESULT>
