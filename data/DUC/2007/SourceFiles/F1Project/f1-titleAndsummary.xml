				<DATA>Prospective randomized trial which validates the use of concomitant chemotherapy with radiation in the management of squamous cell cancer of the anus.  Improved complete response rate, and colostomy free interval over radiation alone with no increase in toxicity.  No significant change in survival or distant disease rate seen, study is underpowered to detect a small to moderate survival benefit. Hartley-The trial investigated whether addition of chemotherapy to radiotherapy would improve local control of advanced anal cancer.  The complete response rate in the chemoRT arm was significantly higher than for RT alone.  Local control at 5 years was also signficantly better.  Severe side effects were no different and overall survival was not significantly different.</DATA>

				<DATA>This is the 10 year follow-up of a trial that compared radical mastectomy to simple mastectomy.  The patients that were randomized to simple mastectomy were able to undergo &quot;node picking&quot; if nodes were palpable.  This trial was terminated early due to the number of axillary recurrences.  The purpose of this paper is to determine long term outcome.  In the initial analysis at 40 months, the simple mastectomy group appeared to have more axillary recurrences (p=0.056).  In the 10 year follow-up, there is no differnce in time to recurrence, or survival between the 2 groups. </DATA>

				<DATA>237 patients were randomized to undergo either modified radical mastectomy or lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy.  The lumpectomy in this series consisted of removal of all gross tumor, although microscopic negative margins were not a necessity. Radiation was performed to a total dose of 4860 cGy.  Patients with positive axillary lymph nodes also had a small supraclavicular field treated, and, and all patients had a boost of 1500 to 2000 cGy to the tumor bed.  Any patient with positive lymph nodes had postoperative chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide.  Both overall survival and disease-free survival were very similar between the two groups.  The actuarial rate of local recurrence at 5 and 8 years was 12% and 20%, respectively.  	A 10-year follow-up of this study showed similar results (ref. 1).  Overall survival for patients treated with mastectomy was 75% versus 75% for patients treated with lumpectomy and radiation (p=0.89).  Disease free survival was 69% for mastectomy and 72% for lumpectomy with radiation (p=0.93).  Local-regional recurrence was 10% for mastectomy and 5% for lumpectomy with radiation (p=0.17). </DATA>

				<DATA>This is a randomized trial of the Danish Cooperative group evaluating the effect of adding postmastectomy radiotherapy to adjuvant tamoxifen in  postmenopausal women.  Women were randomized to tamoxifen for one year, and tamoxifen plus radiotherapy.  Median number of lymph nodes removed at the time of surgery was seven. In the tamoxifen and radiotherapy group compared to the tamoxifen alone group, locoregional recurrence decreased from 35% to 8% (p&lt;0.001), disease-free survival increased from 24% to 36% with radiotherapy (p,0.001), and overall survival also increased with radiotherapy from 36% to 45 % (p=0.03).	Limitations of this study include the limited extent of axillary surgery, where the median number of lymph nodes is considered low by standard practice. In addition the short duration of tamoxifen (1 year), does not reflect standard practice. Despite these limitations this study, the importance of local control reflected in the survival benefits.  </DATA>

				<DATA>There are several trials involving the use of tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting.  The NSABP-B24 trial randomized 1804 women with DCIS, including those with positive margins to lumpectomy, radiation treatment, and tamoxifen 20mg/day for 5 years or lumpectomy, radiation treatment, and placebo for 5 years.  Median follow-up was 74 months.  Women treated with tamoxifen had significantly fewer breast cancer events that did those taking placebo (8.2% vs. 13.4%, p=0.0009).  The cumulative incidence of all invasive breast cancers in the tamoxifen group was 4.1% at 5 years.  Tamoxifen decreased ipsilateral invasive breast cancers by 44%.  This statically significant reduction was only seen with invasive cancers, as the decrease for non-invasive cancers was 18% (p=0.43).  Tamoxifen was found to decrease contralateral breast cancers by 52%.  At 5 years from study entry, survival was 97% in both groups.  The overall conclusion of this well-done study is that tamoxifen decreases invasive breast cancer in both the ipsilateral and contralateral breast.  The combination of lumpectomy, radiation and tamoxifen is effective in the prevention of invasive breast cancer.</DATA>

				<DATA>After several trials using tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting revealed a decrease in the contralateral incidence of breast cancer, the concept of using tamoxifen in the prevention arena arose.  In order to test this theory, the NSABP devised the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (P1).  Women (n=13,388) at an increased risk for developing breast cancer due to one of the following reasons 1) greater than 60 years old or 2) age 35-59 years old with a 5 year predicted risk of breast cancer of &gt;1.66% (Gail model) or 3) personal history of lobular carcinoma in-situ (LCIS), were randomized to receive 20mg/day of tamoxifen or placebo for 5 years.  Tamoxifen was found to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer by 49% (p&lt;0.00001).  The incidence through 69 months of follow-up was 43.4 versus 22.0 per 1000 women in the placebo and tamoxifen groups, respectively.  Tamoxifen reduced the risk of noninvasive breast cancers by 50% (p&lt;0.002).  The administration of tamoxifen did not alter the average rate of ischemic heart disease but a reduction in hip, spine and Colles&apos; fractures was observed.  The rate of endometrial cancer was found to be increased in the tamoxifen group (risk ratio =2.53; 95% confidence interval = 1.35-4.97).  It was found that increased risk of endometrial cancer occurred primarily in women aged 50 and older, and that all of these cancers were stage I.  Overall, the P-1 trial concluded that tamoxifen decrease the incidence of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer.  For women at increased risk for developing breast cancer, even with the known side effects of tamoxifen, its use as a chemopreventive agent may be appropriate.</DATA>

Sixty percent of the primary tumors were between 2-5 cm and 13% were greater or equal to 5.1 cm.  In addition to chemotherapy, patients who were greater than 50 years old began tamoxifen at completion of chemotherapy.  This study reports the 5-year follow up.  Disease-free survival, overall survival, and ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence was similar in both groups.  Twelve percent more lumpectomies were performed in the pre-operative group, and breast tumor size was reduced by greater than 50% in 80% of patients receiving pre-operative chemotherapy.  Clinical complete response was seen in 36% of patients, and 26% of patients with a clinical complete response had a pathologic complete response.  Multivariate analysis revealed that smaller tumors and clinically positive lymph nodes were independent predictors of complete clinical response in the breast.</DATA>

				<DATA>A multicenter trial was organized by the European Organization for Research and Treatment (EORTC) that accrued 903 patients between 1980 and 1986.  A total of 902 patients with clinical stage I or II  breast cancer were enrolled in this trial.  Eighty percent of these patients had a tumor of 2.1-5 cm.  Of the evaluable patients, 422 were treated with modified radical mastectomy and 452 were treated with a wide excision incorporating a 1-cm margin.  Radiation therapy was given to a dose of 5000 cGy with a boost of 2500 cGy to the tumor site with iridium implants.  As in the other studies, overall survival and disease-free survival were virtually identical in both groups of patients.  The actuarial 5-year survival in both groups was 85%. The actuarial incidence of local recurrence at 8 years was 13% in patients treated by local excision and radiation and 9% in patients undergoing mastectomy.  A follow-up paper was recently published with a median follow-up of 13.4 years (ref. 1).  10 year overall survival was 66% for mastectomy patients and 65% for lumpectomy with radiation respectively, p=0.11.  The distant metastases free rate was 66% and 61% respectively, p=0.11.  The local regional recurrence was 12% for mastectomy and 20% for lumpectomy with radiation, p=0.01.</DATA>

				<DATA>This study randomized 2644 patients with histologically lymph node negative, ER positive breast cancers to receive 20mg/day of tamoxifen or placebo for a period of 5 years.  Through four years of follow-up, no survival advantage was found (92% for placebo vs 93% for tamoxifen, p=0.03)..  There was a significant difference in disease free survival among those treated with tamoxifen when compared to the placebo group (83% vs 77%, p&lt;0.00001).  Of note, this advantage was observed in both patients less than 50 years old and those greater than 49 years old.  This study concludes that tamoxifen significantly reduced the rate of treatment failure at both local and distant sites, tumors in the opposite breast and the incidence of local recurrence after breast conservation surgery and radiation.</DATA>

				<DATA>Of 77 patients with potentially resectable SCC of the esophagus, only 46 agreed to randomization.  Patients were randomized to chemotherapy with 5-FU and cisplatin followed by surgery vs. surgery alone.  The response rate to chemotherapy was 50% but was associated with a significant complication rate and mortality in 2 patients.  Resection rates were comparable between the two groups, but post-operative morbidity and mortality rates were higher in the chemotherapy group:  higher rates of sepsis (41 vs. 26%), respiratory disorders (48 vs 31%), and death (19 vs 10%).  Patients responding to the chemotherapy had prolonged survival when compared to nonresponders (median 13 vs. 5 months), but the overall survival rates between the two groups were identical (median 10 months).</DATA>

				<DATA>140 patients with inoperable advanced colorectal cancer were randomized to receive 5FU or MMF. Of these 126 were evaluable.1(2%)  patient receiving MMF and 2 (3%) receiving 5FU achieved a CR and 3 (5%) of the MMF and 8 (13%) of the 5-FU group achieved partial response. Overall, 14 patients achieved some remission, 4 (6%) in the MMF group and 10 (16%) in the 5-FU group (p=.10). Fewer disease sites had a higher proportion of responses. Ten of 57 (18%) having only liver metastases reponded and no one with more than two disease sites responded.  Of those with only liver metastases, 6/15 (40%) with normal LFT&apos;s responded in contrast to 4/42 (10%) with one or more abnormal LFT&apos;s (p=.016). Five years after termination of the study all but one patient have died, with the survivor had a single liver metastases treated with 5-FU alone and achieved a CR. Median survival time were 9.5 months for MMF and 10.3 months for 5-FU (NS). Hematologic toxicity was greater in the MMF group than the 5-FU group (p&lt;.001). GI toxicity was equal but percents not stated between group. Overall, no advantage to MMF vs 5-FU. Best predictor of response was disease limited to the liver with normal LFT&apos;s.</DATA>

				<DATA>This was an attempt to demonstrate an improvement in survival in patients with recurrent, unresectable or residual rectosigmoid and rectal cancer following RT + 5FU + M-CCNU vs RT alone. Patients were randomized to one of these groups, but not stratified. After exclusion due to ineligibility, 129 patients were randomized. 24% of all patients or 51% of patients with residual disease had only microscopic disease following resection. In 19 patients, the disease was thought to be resectable following treatment and surgery was performed. IORT was performed in 9 of the 19. Overall median survival was 17 months for RT and 18 months for RT + Chemo (NS). During this study period, 87 (67%) of patients died and of the remaining patients median follow up was 30 months. Patients with resected disease either prior to or following treatment trended toward an improved survival compared to inoperable disease. </DATA>

				<DATA>A very important trial that evaluated the use of HAI 5FU versus no treatment as an adjuvant to completely resected hepatic metastases.  The trial was planned and powered to detect and improvement in survival by 50%.  The publication is their interim analysis that terminated the trial.  The basic finding was that survival was not improved.  A significant number of patients assigned to the adjuvant chemotherapy group did not receive the intended therapy and some of the patients assigned to no therapy were actually given chemotherapy.  An intention to treat anlaysis was appropriately used.  The findings must be interpreted in the context of the large number of patients who were unable to receive the assigned adjuvant therapy for a variety of reasons.</DATA>

				<DATA>This was a trial designed to show the 5FU given via HAI would be more efficacious systemically (addressing extrahepatic failure as well as intrahepatic disease) and less toxic to the liver.  It was powered to detect a 50% increase in time to hepatic progression.  Analysis was quite difficult because a significant number of patients were switched to IV therapy alone secondary to technical problems placing HAI catheters.  When compared to HAI FUDR, HAI 5FU resulted in a slightly increased time to progression, although there was no difference in this parameter when compared to IV 5FU (a therapy historically considered ineffective).  Overall survival was not significantly different between these groups.  Importantly, the trends towards improved progression free survival and overall survival seen with HAI 5FU were enhanced and statistically significant in the subgroup of patients with &lt;25% hepatic replacement (a paramter stratified for in the trial).  These two primary endpoints were analyzed in an intention to treat manner justifying these results.  In an analysis of hepatic response rates and extrahepatic progression performed by treatment received, some valuable lessons are learned.  HAI FUDR and 5FU were equally effective in the liver while IV 5FU was largely ineffective.  More importantly, HAI 5FU had a similar rate of low extrahepatic progression as IV FU.  HAI FUDR failed in an extrahepatic manner as has been shown before.  An additional problem with this study design is that the HAI groups underwent a staging laparotomy to rule out extrahepatic disease while those assigned to IV therapy do not.  No definite conclusion can be reached from this trial, but significant lessons were learned.</DATA>

				<DATA>A very well performed study whose primary objective was to demonstrate a 20% reduction in hepatic recurrence and a 20% increase in survival at 2 years.  The groups are well balanced and overall the study was adequately powered for its objective.  Analysis at 2 years shows an improved survival, survival free of hepatic progression and overall progression free survival in the patients receiving HAI FUDR and IV 5FU.  However, when you look at the actuarial survival curves that go out to 90 months, a somewhat different outcome is seen.  The overall survival curves meet after 5 years and a comparison of the two whole curves are not statistically significant.  Similarly, the curves for progression free survival begin to meet beyond 5 years and are of marginal difference statistically.  The clear difference is seen in the hepatic progression free curves where the benefit of HAI therapy is most clearly demonstrated to be of lasting value.  This is a critically important study that demonstrates that combined regional and systemic therapy is much more effective than systemic therapy alone at controlling hepatic recurrence after metastastectomy and improves survival at least in the short term.  </DATA>

The main outcome studied was quality of life and there is no difference between the groups.  Survival was nearly doubled and quality of life was maintained.  The morbidity of the pump placement was generally minor and patients were able to receive a significant amount of FUDR without prohibitive morbidity or compromising quality of life.  This is a very important study and answers the question that it answers.  It obviously doesn&apos;t address the use of systemic chemotherapy in a systematic way.</DATA>

				<DATA>This a large multi-center trial that evaluated the use of HAI FUDR versus supportive therapy without allowing cross over.  The control group was placed on systemic 5FU chemotherapy or treated without chemotherapy based on the clinicians preference.  Additionally, 30% of the patients in the HAI group received systemic chemotherapy.  Survival was clearly improved with HAI FUDR, although there was a significant cost in terms of morbidity.  The study clearly shows the ability to control hepatic disease with HAI chemotherapy and to prolong survival compared to supportive therapy alone.  Extrahepatic disease was a problem for the HAI group.  The moribidy of HAI FUDR was mainly hepatic and transiently interrupted therapy in 80% of cases demonstrating the need to be able to diminish this toxicity.  The extrahepatic failures also demonstrated the need for effective systemic therapy in addition to controlling liver disease.  Despite the relatively random use of systemic chemotherapy the trial is still quite convincing in its conclusions.</DATA>

The only significant differences were found within the A group (single resected with or without HAI FUDR).  Time to failure was longer (8 v 30 mths).  median survival was longer (28 v 37 mths) in the patients receiving post op HAI, but not statistically significant.  Further subset analysis was attempted on Dukes staging of the primary tumor (not stratified for).  There were no significant differences within the B group (resection + HAI vs. HAI alone for mult resectable mets).</DATA>

				<DATA>This is a well powered trial that attempted to address time to hepatic progression and response rates rather than survival.  Patients in the HAI FUDR group that had extrahepatic disease at laparotomy were included making the two groups comparable (the IV FUDR group didn&apos;t undergo staging laparotomy).  The ability of HAI FUDR to control hepatic disease better than IV therapy is clearly demonstrated.  One weakening point is that 9 of 67 patients planned for hepatic artery pump were unable to have the pump implanted for a variety of reasons and these patients were not included in the analysis.  One could argue that these patients should be included in a pure intention to treat analysis.  Cross over was allowed and patients that progressed on IV FUDR crossed over to HAI FUDR quite often making survival analysis relatively meaningless.  A major lesson of the study was that IV FUDR therapy was limited by progression of disease, while HAI FUDR was limited by hepatic and biliary tree toxicity.  </DATA>

				<DATA>same as Acta Gastroenterologica Belgica1993; 56: 271- 278This reports the results of a European multicenter randomized prospective controlled double-blinded trial of octreotide [octreotide 100 mcg sc tid x 1 week, n=125] vs placebo [sc tid x 1 week, n=121] in patients undergoing major pancreatic resection for pancreatic or periampullary malignancies, or chronic pancreatitis. Overall 90-day mortality was similar in the two groups: 3.2 vs 5.8%.  In the high-risk group defined as those patients with pancreatic or periampullary tumors the mortality and complication rates for the treated and placebo group were significantly different, 2.9 vs 9.8%, and 38 vs 65%, respectively. In the low risk patients with benign pancreatic pathology, the morbidity and mortality rates were similar amongst the two groups. Postoperative pancreatitis, although reported was undefined.  Statistical methodology was not included as part of the manuscript. Based on the study sample size, the total number of patients in this study could only support an analysis of the treatment groups as a whole, and statistical analysis of risk subgroups is limited by small sample size.  A &quot;significant&quot; reduction of postoperative complications was observed in high-risk (cancer) patients treated with octreotide following pancreas surgery.</DATA>

Oral cyclophosphamide monotherapy was equally effective as CMF, and both were significantly better than RT alone (p=0.0009 and 0.0001, respectively) in the improvement of relaspe-free survival.  However, there was a slight tendency for cyclophopamide to be less effective than CMF in more advanced disease.Hematological toxicity, degree of alopecia, and amenorrhea were more pronounced with C than with CMF, whereas nausea and stomatitis was greater with CMF than with C.</DATA>

				<DATA>Fisher randomized patients with operable breast cancer (N0 or N1) from 1971 to 1974 into groups that were stratified based on clinical axillary node status.  For clinically AN negative patients (n=1159) patients were randomized to treatment with radical mastectomy (n=354) versus total mastectomy (n=282).  In the total mastectomy group, axillary node dissection was performed only if on post-operative follow-up patients had developed clinically palpable nodes.  The third group was total mastectomy plus radiation (chest wall, axilla, supraclavicular, and internal mammary) (n=344).  There was no difference in overall survival, disease free interval, distant metastases, or local recurrence between groups.	Patients with clinically positive lymph nodes on initial presentation were randomized to receive radical mastectomy (n=277) versus total mastectomy plus radiation (n=224).  Again, there was no difference in overall survival, disease free interval, or distant metastases between groups.  Local recurrence was lower in the group receiving total mastectomy plus radiation than the group receiving radical mastectomy.	A follow-up study from NSABP B-04 (ref. 1) evaluated the clinical and biologic significance of medial-central breast cancers.  A comparison of patients with similar clinical nodal status and tumor location who were treated by either radical mastectomy or by total mastectomy plus radiation failed to indicate that radiation of IM nodes reduced the probability of distant treatment failure or mortality.  	A 10-year follow-up report of NSABP-04 (ref. 2) also found no difference in DFS or overall survival between groups, and also found that tumor location in the breast does not influence the prognosis and that irradiation of internal mammary lymph nodes in patients with inner quadrant tumors does not improve survival.  In clinically node negative patients treated by radical mastectomy, total mastectomy plus radiation, or total mastectomy alone, OS was 58%, 59%, and 54% respectively (P=0.5).  In clinically positive patients treated by radical mastectomy versus total mastectomy plus radiation, OS was 38% and 39% respectively.	Positive axillary nodes occurred in 17.8% of patients with clinically negative nodes who underwent total mastectomy without radiation.  These patients subsequently had delayed axillary lymph node dissection.  The median time from mastectomy to axillary dissection was 14.7 months. 	A major criticism of the NSABP B-04 has been made that questions the survival benefit of axillary dissection.  Harris and Osteen (ref. 3) have argued that the NSABP-04 was underpowered to detect a potential benefit of axillary treatment.  They state that approximately 360 patients with clinically negative lymph nodes were assigned to each treatment arm. Axillary lymph node metastases were found in 38.6% of patients undergoing radical mastectomy.  The value of axillary treatment is restricted to patients who have excision of positive nodes because excision of negative axillary nodes has no benefit.  The critical population is then 137 patients (38.6% of 360) who are presumed to have positive axillary nodes.  Axillary treatment is not of value in patients who have occult distant metastatic disease at presentation and only one quarter of patients with positive axillary nodes are free of distant disease after 10 years.  Therefore, one quarter of 137 or approximately 34 patients who have positive nodes but no occult distant metastatic disease could benefit from axillary treatment.  In addition, one must consider the salvage potential of delayed axillary treatment.  If one quarter (although the proportion is unknown) of patients with total mastectomy alone have prompt operation for the appearance of suspicious lymph nodes and are still &quot;curable&quot;, then delayed axillary dissection cures an additional eight patients.  This leaves 26 patients who could possibly have benefited form initial axillary treatment, or 7% of the total group. </DATA>

				<DATA>Another study involving tamoxifen in the treatment of breast cancer is a prospective randomized trial comparing tamoxifen to surgery in elderly patients.  J.C. Gazet et al, randomized 116 patients aged 70 or over who had surgically resectable breast cancer and who were medically cleared for surgery to receive 20mg/day of tamoxifen or surgical resection.  At a median follow-up of three years, a local relapse or progression was seen in 15 of 60 patients (25%) in the tamoxifen group and in 21 of 56 patients (37.5%), which was not a significant difference.   There was no statistical difference in time to progression or overall survival.  One of the limitations of this study is the number of patients that crossed arms of the study.  All patients with local recurrence after surgery received tamoxifen and all patients with progression of disease or relapse on tamoxifen, in the absence of distant metastases had surgery.  The crossover may have reduced any differences in mortality between the 2 groups.  This study concludes that tamoxifen can be used as first line treatment in patients over 70 years old, reserving surgery for those patients who do not respond to tamoxifen.</DATA>

The overall conclusion of this study was that , combination cytotoxic drug treatment is more likely to produce a response and to prolong life than immediate endocrine treatment for advanced breast cancer. </DATA>

				<DATA>Preliminary results of a more complex trial, still open at the time of publication, with the goal of accruing 200 patients.  Study design incorporated a comparison of patients randomized to perioperative chemotherapy vs. radiotherapy.  Patients who responded to 2 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy continued on with 4 more cycles postoperatively.  However, nonresponders were crossed over to radiotherapy.  This study only reported on response and toxicity from preoperative treatment.  Remission rates were comparable between the 2 groups.  Toxicity from the chemotherapy arm was remarkably low despite a regimen which includes 5 cytotoxic agents and tamoxifen.  Interestingly, chemotherapy appeared to reduce hormonal receptor content while radiotherapy increased (difference not significant).</DATA>

				<DATA>In pts over age 70, tamoxifen was compared to wedge mastectomy (differs from total mastectomy in that no flaps are raised) in pts with operable breast cancer (&lt;5cm). Although there was no difference in survival between the 2 groups after 2 yrs, those in the tamoxifen group had a higher local recurrence rate and eventually needed surgery.  This study suggests that optimal treatment may include mastectomy followed by tamoxifen.  One problem is this study is the cross-over between the 2 groups.  Twenty six patients in the tamoxifen group eventually underwent surgery.</DATA>

Overall 10-year survival was not significantly different for patients who received ELND vs. nodal observation.

This subgroup analysis has drawn criticism from experts in the field. The practice of ELND for the subgroups identified by the investigators has not been widely accepted, despite the findings reported in this paper.</DATA>

				<DATA>Patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery were randomized to receive preoperative bowel prep with polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution (PEG-ELS) or no bowel prep.  All patients received preoperative IV ceftriaxone and were equally distributed in terms of sex, percentage of cancers, types of colorectal illnesses, comorbidities, types of operations, and types of anastomoses (hand sewn vs. stapled).  There was no difference in terms of post-operative infectious complications (9% vs 8%) or anastomotic problems (4% vs 2%).  There was also no significant difference in terms of non-infectious complications, return to bowel function (4.8 vs. 5 days), or hospital stay (8 days for both groups).  There was no mortalities in either group.  The authors conclude that bowel prep with PEG-ELS is not necessary as a preparation for routine colorectal surgery.</DATA>

Time to complete the anastamosis was shorter by 10 minutes for the single layer group (p&lt;0.001), there were 2 leaks in the 2 layer group, 1 leak in the one layer group, and  2 abscesses in each group(p=ns).  Length of stay was 2 days shorter in the one layer group (p=0.08).  Cost for materials was less in the one layer group. Statistics performed based on number of anastomoses, not patients.  Gastro-jejunostomies and low rectal anastamoses were excluded, as were any patients in whom the surgeon felt both techniques were not equivalent for technical reasons. Interestingly, this study was done without informed consent as the IRB felt both techniques were in use already and had established efficacy.  </DATA>

Quality of life was not significantly different and the drug was well tolerated with equivalent systemic exposure to the parent active metabolite of the drug.

				<DATA>Nitrosoureas have shown to have a response rate similar to dacarbazine in malignant melanoma but had not previously been adequately evaluated as an adjuvant modality. In this study, patients with either lymphogenous or hematogenous dissemination were randomized into 2 treatment arms: observation vs. adjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was well tolerated. Side effects included paresthesias secondary to vincristine use as well as prolonged myelosuppression. 5 year DFS in observation group was 9% vs. 29% in the treatment group (p=0.03). However, there was no difference in overall 5- year survival rate between the 2 groups (25% for observation vs. 30% in treatment, p=0.59). The discrepancy was attributed to a difference in survival times following first recurrence from entry in the protocol. Median survival for patients who relapsed in the observation arm was 10.3 months compared to 5.2 months in the treatment arm following first recurrence. Conclusion: adjuvant chemotherapy given in this study reduced amount of microscopic disease at present but progression was faster after relapse.</DATA>

The rate of enucleation between the 2 groups was different though not statistically significant (17.3% for iodine 125 vs. 9.3% for helium ions). Following helium ion therapy, enucleations were due to treatment complications (9.3%) whereas in iodine 125, the enucleations were due to local tumor failure (10 of 17 cases). Anterior segment complications were significantly more frequent in patients treated with helium ion. There was no difference in metastatic deaths or development of metastases in the 2 groups.

				<DATA>Randomized study to compare efficacy of DTIC and DTIC + tamoxifen in patients with metastatic melanoma. Patient characteristics between the 2 arms were comparable.  Authors noted three main results: 1] DTIC + tamoxifen was more effective than DTIC alone with respect to response rates and length of survival, 2] Difference in treatment arms were more distinct among women, 3] Retrospective, subgroup analysis of those patients who received DTIC + tamoxifen showed that men and postmenopausal women with BMI &gt;median value had better overall survival than those with BMI&lt;median value. Longer survival is more likely for women than men early in disease, but not once metastases occur. The authors conclude that given the findings of the study, tamoxifen should now be considered standard therapy in patients with metastatic melanoma.</DATA>

Patients in the combination treatment arm received BCNU on day 3 of 5 after the 3rd dose of TNF administration. There was no difference in patient characteristics between the 2 treatment arms. Treatment consisted of a median of 2 courses for BCNU and 2 courses of BCNU + rhTNFalpha. There was no difference in median overall survival (6 months for both groups). There were no differences in response. Regarding toxicity, there were no differences except those receiving combined therapy experienced anticipated reactions secondary to infusion of TNF-alpha, specifically fevers, rigors and hypotension. Conclusion: though no significant differences seen between 2 treatment arms in this phase II study, perhaps phase III study with increase in number of patients would be helpful given great interest in cytokines combined with chemotherapy.</DATA>

Those in the CYP groups received CYP 3 days prior to each MCV treatment. Blood samples from MCV alone were analyzed for suppressor cell activity. In addition, blood samples were serially obtained from the patients with MCV + different dosages of CYP. 34 patients were entered who were NED; 7 patients were AWD. Mean suppressor cell activity at initiation of treatment was 32.3, 24.5, and 40% for 75, 150, and 300 mg CYP/m2, respectively. At the end of the 4th treatment, 28.4, 25.4, and 33.7% mean suppressor cell activity seen in patients treated with 75, 150 and 300 mg CYP/m2, respectively. For all CYP dosages, the most reduction in mean occurred in the first 2 CYP treatments. The 300 mg CYP dosage had the highest overall mean reduction in suppressor cell activity. Only this latter dose had a statistical significance (p&lt;0.01). Clinical status of patients at 12 months of therapy was correlated to suppressor cell activity. There was a higher correlation in the MCV+CYP 300 and 150 groups than the 75 and control groups. These differences were significant (p&lt;0.05). The authors conclude that CYP as an immunomodulator can reduce suppressor cell activity in patients receiving MCV.</DATA>

Phase II study comparing dacarbazine-vindesine combination compared to dacarbazine alone to see if there are any additive effects of vindesine on disseminated malignant melanoma. There were no major differences between treatment arms regarding patient distribution or characteristics. In the DTIC group, 8% had complete remission and 10% partial remission. In the combination DTIC-vindesine group, 13% had complete remission and 12% partial remission. Overall response rate for DTIC was 18% and for DTIC-vindesine was 25%; difference was not statistically significant. Median response duration was 123 days for DTIC and 171 days for DTIC-vindesine; also not statistically significant. There were however statistically significant response rates for skin, lymph node and lung metastases when compared with liver, bone and CNS metastases. Median survival time after start of treatment was 4.7 months for DTIC and 5.8 months for DTIC-vindesine. The survival rate was statistically significant between the 2 treatment arms: 11.7 months for responders and 3.4 months for non-responders (p&lt;0.001). Toxicity was more pronounced in the combination arm. Alopecia was seen more frequently in the combination arm.

There was no statistically significant difference in time to disease progression between the 2 arms (p=0.29). Toxicity was notable: 60% in each arm required a dose reduction of 50% or more secondary to treatment-related toxicity. Most common reason was severe fatigue. Mean maximal temperature during induction was significantly different between the 2 arms (102.1 vs. 100.7 for interferon alone and indomethacin+IFN, respectively). One patient receiving indomethacin did have a massive UGI bleed. Baseline NK activity differed significantly between the 2 groups.

				<DATA>Malignant melanoma has traditionally been radioresistant in treatment. There is clinical data suggestive that more than 4-5 Gy per fraction may improve the radiation response. 2 schedules were compared in a randomized study. 35 cutaneous or lymph node metastases in 14 patients were entered. 18 sites in the 5 Gy x 8 schedule and 17 sites in the 9 Gy x 3 schedule. Both schedules were given with 2 fractions per week.  Both treatment arms were well tolerated. 69% of tumors disappeared completely. Both schedules produced similar tumor responses. In terms of toxicity, acute normal tissue reaction was almost identical in the 2 arms. The authors conclude that melanoma is radiosensitive when treated with high doses per fraction, both treatments were effective and well tolerated.</DATA>

Patients were randomized into 3 groups: control, DTIC, CTIC/CCNU/Vincristine. Due to the small numbers of patients in the 3rd treatment arm (combined chemotherapy), they were combined with the DTIC arm results. Followup time was 36 months. Overall survival of patients in the chemotherapy group was significantly longer (p&lt;0.025) compared to control group. None of the patients had recurrent tumor.

Toxicity profiles in epi-DX similar to doxorubicin (DX). Animal models using the combination of DTIC and DX have shown synergism. This study randomized 42 patients into 2 arms: DTIC and DTIC+epi-DX.  Patient characteristics between the 2 arms were similar. Although the combined arm had a 21.2% partial response compared to 9.1% in the DTIC control arm, this difference was not statistically significant.

				<DATA>Use of thymic factors in cancer therapy is suggested by its immunomodulatory activity and its effectiveness as an antitumor agent on tumor models. 37 patients with Stage I or Stage II melanoma were randomized blindly into 2 groups: no therapy vs. TS therapy. Patient characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. Mean tumor thickness was greater in the TS-treated cases compared to no therapy group. In addition, more males were in the TS-group.  Though the sample size is small, the authors noted the following: more untreated patients had recurrence of their disease and the recurrence occurred earlier compared to the TS group. This was most apparent in the stage I patients. There were no toxic or allergic side effects seen with the TS treatment, either. Survival in the treatment group was 100% compared to 71.6% at the end of 15 months (p=0.05). At the end of the first year, all cases in the treated group were disease-free compared to 62.2% in the no therapy arm. This difference was significant (p&lt;0.01). By the end of the 21st month, the rate of disease free persons was equal in both groups. One Ts treated patient developed distant metastasis where 3 in the control group developed distant metastasis.</DATA>

Patient characteristics were similar between the 2 groups except that in the BCG group, there was more depth of tumor invasion (0.75 to 1.5 mm). Disease free survival rates were higher in the BCG group but not statistically significant (p=0.194). 24 patients in the BCG group had a recurrence within a median followup period of 4 years compared to 33 in the control group. There were fewer local/regional recurrences in the BCG group however the difference was not significant (p=0.59). There were no differences in the sites of distant metastases and the number of patients where distant metastases was the first recurrence was similar between the 2 arms. There were minimal side effects with BCG. Intradermal injection yielded mild erythema and pruritus. Oral therapy yielded mild diarrhea. Thus, the authors conclude that adjuvant BCG immunotherapy is not beneficial as adjuvant therapy in Stage I melanoma patients.</DATA>

				<DATA>Chlorozotocin is a chloroethylnitrosourea that has shown promise as an antitumor agent in phase I and II trials against malignant melanoma. Neocarzinostatin is a polypeptide antibiotic shown in previous studies to have some response in malignant melanoma. Authors used unbalanced randomization to 3 treatment arms.  Fewer patients were assigned to control arm (MeCCNU) in order to combine current MeCCNU patients with previous patients thereby increasing the numbers. Patient characteristics were similar among the treatment arms. The chlorozotocin group had a 9% overall response rate compared to the neocarzinostatin group having a 4% overall response rate. MeCCNU had a 14% overall response rate. Median survival times for patients on chlorotozocin, neocarzinostatin and MeCCNU were 4.2, 3.4 and 5.8 months respectively. Toxicities associated with chlorozotocin were gastrointestinal and thrombocytopenia. Toxicities associated with neocarzinostatin included thrombocytopenia and one life threatening allergic reaction. The authors conclude that the 2 new agents investigated here are not active agents nor do they confer any clinically significant advantages over MeCCNU.</DATA>

Features associated with poor prognosis included male sex, prior therapy, multiple disease sites, and visceral disease involvement. A median of 2 cycles of therapy were given in each treatment arm. The protocol dosage was reduced 44% in VBD patients and 18% of DTIC patients secondary to poor hematologic tolerance. In the VBD arm, 10% achieved partial remission compared to 14% in DTIC (not statistically significant). A greater proportion of patients achieved disease stabilization in the VBD arm although not significant. Improvement was seen after a single course of treatment if there was a response in either arm. Response duration and survival for DTIC responders tended to be longer but the differences were not significant. Progression free survival and overall survival also were not signficantly different. Toxicity was considerable in both arms: myelosuppressive effects as well as gastrointestinal insults. The authors conclude that VBD does not confer any significant advantage compared to DTIC in terms of antitumor effect or toxicity.</DATA>

				<DATA>Based on previous studies suggestive of combined chemotherapy as well as immunotherapy showing response rates higher than the standard chemotherapy regimen of DTIC, the authors randomized patients with disseminated melanoma into 4 treatment arms. Overall response rate of BHD was 24%, BHD+levamisole was 25% and DTIC+actinomycin D was 22%. These were not statistically different. 4 prognostic factors were significantly associated with response: sex (females faring better), better performance status, primary site (extremities faring better), and lymphocyte counts (&gt;2000 better than lymphopenia). When length of response was evaluated, responders in DTIC + actinomycin D had a median length of 37 weeks compared to 17 weeks for the chemoimmunotherapy responders (p=0.05).  There was no difference among the treatment arms when looking at survival from the start of treatment. Authors conclude that addition of levamisole to BHD does not improve response rate and may be detrimental to length of response and to survival in certain groups.</DATA>

The treatment arm received preop intralymphatic immunotherapy with MER-BCG, surgical excision with regional lymphadenectomy, intraop infiltration with MER-BCG (site lnd) and postop monthly intradermal vaccinations with BCG (posterior trunk/proximal extremity site).  Control patients received surgery and lymphadenectomy alone.  The median follow-up was 30 months.  Overall, the authors demonstrate a significant difference in recurrence rates between the two groups (1/13 treatment vs 4/7 control, p=0.015) with a benefit noted in patients treated with adjuvant immunotherapy.

The authors show no statistically significant difference in disease free or overall survival between the four treatment groups with a mean follow-up of 41 months. All patients are included in the final analysis, although they mention in 17.8 percent of patients receiving dacarbazine, the treatment had to be discontinued or reduced due to nausea and vomitting (see* above).  Subgroup analysis of disease free and overall survival according to sex and number of involved regional nodes showed no statistically significant difference between the four groups.  The only isolated finding was in patients with two or three involved nodes treated with surgery plus dacarbazine and BCG were shown to have a 50% higher survival rate that those treated with surgery alone (p=0.01).  The authors report that this isolated finding, in the face of multiple comparisons in subgroup analysis, is likely due to chance and is not actually statistically significant.  In comparing the difference between the overall highest to lowest rates at 36 months: 1) disease free survival for surgery alone vs surgery + DTIC was 6.78% 2) overall survival for surgery alone vs surgery + DTIC + BCG was 8.47%.  The number of patients and power of the study should have detected a 14 percent difference of statistical significance with an error of 10%.  The authors state that an advantage of adjuvant treatment was not shown; it either did not exist or it was of limited clinical importance.</DATA>

For patients who responded, there were no statistically significant differences in the length of response.  While the overall survival was not influenced by the therapy instituted, statistically significant differences were noted in survival depending on the type of response.  Median survival for complete responders (165weeks) vs partial responders (53 weeks) vs nonresponders (20 weeks) were significantly different (p=0.001).  Subgroup analysis showed some differences related to age with patients less than 30 years of age having an extremel;y poor response rate regardless of the therapy.  The duration of response also differed by treatment only in patients with pulmonary mets (BHD + BCG had longer response rates) and those older than 60 years (patients who responded had the longest duration with DTIC + BCG).  Significant difference in survival was also noted in this group.  When all patients were combined, those with higher numbers of positive delayed hypersensitivity reactions had improved survival (p=0.05).  Also, patients with pretherapy peripheral lymphocyte counts greater than 2000/mm3 had the best response rates.  Survival improvement was also noted in patients whose PPD converted from negative to positive during therapy.  Toxicity was comparable in all the three groups.</DATA>

				<DATA>The authors carried out this randomized trial due to the encouraging results from a pilot study showing a benefit of duration of survival in patients treated with combination DTIC, actinomycin D, and c. parvum vs DTIC alone. However, in this study, no significant differences were noted between patients treated with DTIC + actinomycin D and DTIC+ actinomycin D + c.parvum with respect to remission rates (15%,n=5 and 12%,n=4), remission duration (7.6 mo vs 12 mo), median survival rate (8.8mo vs 6.9 mo).  The addition of c parvum to combination DTIC + actinomycin D is therefore not recommended by the authors.  They also make reference to previous historical controls for DTIC treatment alone and furthermore conclude no added advantage to the addition of actinomycin D with respect to remission duration, survival, and toxicity.  Study is small and early dropouts from death due to disease and chemotoxicity were high. </DATA>

Overall, the DFI for the two treatment arms were not significantly different at a median followup of 24 mo.  However, univariate analysis of several prognostic factors showed that tumor thickness &lt; 3mm (p.001) and level of invasion &lt;level V (p=.005) were favorable with respect to DFI.  Multifactorial analysis demonstrated tumor thickness (p=.007) as a dominant prognostic factor correlating with DFI as well as those patients with primary trunk melanomas fairing worse than those with other primary sites (p.015).  Patients subgrouped according to thickness of melanoma were analysed and although 3mm thickness was not a stratification criteria, the groups were well matched with respect to prognostic factors.  There was no difference in DFI for patients with melanomas &lt; 3mm (n=175).  However, when patients with melanoma &gt; 3mm were studied, the 29 patients in the immunotherapy treatment arm had significantly improved survival compared to the 24 patients in the surgical control arm (p=.01).

With hydration alone, 7 of 33 (21%) had moderate to fatal renal toxicity after the first cisplatin dose compared to 1 of 34 (3%) with the addition of mannitol.  Overall, there were 7 objective responses in 67 patients (2/33, 6% hydration group, 5/34, 14.7% mannitol group)</DATA>

				<DATA>This is a preliminary report of high risk stage I and II melanoma patients treated surgically, followed by adjuvant chemo or chemoimmunotherapy with 166 evaluable patients at a median follow up of 29 months.  Treatment groups were well stratified for age, depth of primary lesion and pre-treatment stratification variables including site of lesion, clinical and histological evalution and number of lymph nodes.  Successful stratification of prognostic variables was reflected in an overall 30% disease free survival at 3 yr f/u in the control arm, comparable to other major reports.  Primary outcome measures of disease free interval and overall survival rate for treatment arms compared to control arm was not significantly different. The study was sufficiently powered to detect a 30% difference as previously described by Morton et al with BCG therapy.  Relative to control group in the methyl-CCNU and BCG + vaccine groups at 12 mo follow-up, there appeared to be a trend towards improved DFS although not statistically significant (p &gt;0.76 and 0.28, respectively).  It is possible that a smaller difference was present and just not powered for detection by this study.  Toxicity of the chemotherapy arm was consistent with previously published reports and 3 of 25 patient treated with &gt; 1200mg.m2 of methuyl-CCNU developed renal failure requiring dialysis.  Toxicity with BCG and immunotherapy was similar to known, published toxicities</DATA>

				<DATA>This multi-institutional trial of adjuvant DTIC therapy (4 courses for 10 days,4.5 mg/kg/d) vs surgical control showed no significant difference in DFI or overall DFS at 4 year f/u.  In fact, at a median f/u of 2.5 yrs an analysis of DFI showed a significant difference favoring the control arm (p=0.04, median 73 vs 40 wks). Randomization to treatment and control arms was adequately distributed for sex, age, primary site, stage and institution. An analysis of DFI and DFS according to variables of sex, primary site, stage,  showed, as expected, that stage I pts did best. Subsequent covariate analysis including the treatment group and age showed the variables with the greatest effect on DFI were stage and treatment and on DFS was treatment only with the control group being favored.  Treatment toxicities including thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were further evaluated by subset analysis for their effects on DFS and DFI.  Overall, the presence of toxicity was associated with a longer DFI and DFS.  These results prompted a followup nonrandomized groupwise feasibility study of 23 patients utilizing a higher dose of DTIC in the first postop year with dose escalation to render all pts thrombocytopenic and leukopenic.  The authors mention the results of 16 pts at one year followup and again no significant difference was noted between the groups inthis small cohort of patients.</DATA>

All patients underwent wide excision of primary with regional lymph node dissection (except one in treatment group and 2 in control group who were clinically neg).  The overwhelming factor which determined recurrence was involvement of lymph nodes (6/37 pt with neg nodes vs 13/21 with pos nodes).  In considering pastients who failed therapy there was no difference between controls and treatment with the addition of choemoimmuno therapy.  Recurrence and death rates did correlate with node positivity.  10 of 13 pts in the treatment group had pos nodes and the recurrence and death rates were 2.5 times higher in this group.</DATA>

				<DATA>This is the final report of the Southeastern Cancer Study Group multiinstitutional trial comparing the additive value of c.parvum to cyclophosphamide and DTIC in patients with advanced melanoma.Although no stratification was done, the groups were well matched for age, site of metastases and performance status.  One drawback of the study was that response rates were evaluated at one time only that is, 3 weeks following the third course of chemotherapy.  This method of analysis served to underestimate the total response rate and makes it difficult to compare to other studies.In summary, response rates were not different between the groups (14% vs 25.5%, regimen A vs B respectively).  When analysed according to metastasis site there were still no significant differences in response rates.  Visceral met 9.6% vs 21.9% and skin/lymph node 30.8% vs 35.7% (regimen A vs regimen B, respectively).  Although not statistically significant, those patients with better performance status and those who received at least three courses had improved response rates. Overall, there was no difference in survival between groups 6.1 months vs 5.7 months, regimen A vs B, respectively.  The dose limiting toxicity was myelosuppression which was similar for both groups and was fairly well-tolerated.  Overall, this study appeared to show a slight advantage in response rates favorring the addition of c.parvum. Unfortnately the study was not powered to detect the 10% difference between groups (14% vs 25.5%) </DATA>

				<DATA>Multi-institutional prospective trial testing the efficacy of two different delivery methods of BCG in pts with metastatic melanoma who had a minimal body burden of disease.  Patients included those with histologically proven, surgically incurable melanoma metastatic to minimal local, regional, soft tissue, nodal and intransit sites.  Pts with visceral mets were excluded. Lesions &lt; 5cm were treated and 80% of lesions were &lt; 2cm.  Intralesional BCG was hypothesized to be of greater value due to its direct immunomodulating effect at the site of tumor cells vs nonspecific rx given at non-tumor bearing sites as a vaccine.  Pts were stratified prior to randomization for history of prior chemotherapy.  Total dose IL-BCG was 3 x 10(7) cfu/wk x 6 weeks [6 x 10(6) cfu per lesion] and 3 x 10(8) cfu/wk x 6 weeks for MPV-BCG.  Pts who progressed or relapsed were subsequently randomized to a chemo program of DTIC and MCCNU either concommittently or sequentially.Groups were well matched for a variety of prognostic factors.Overall, toxicity was more severe and reactions more common in the IL-BCG group and 3 pts required anti-TB rx with subsequent resolution of symptoms. No pt died of rx and hematologic toxicity was less than that of previous reports with IL-BCG.  Objective tumor response was greater in the IL-BCG group 45% vs 9% with median duration of response of 18 weeks.  These values had no statistical measures applied most likely due to small numbers involved.  Furthermore, the IL-BCG group was the only group in which complete response was realized including non-injected lesions.Median survival was not statistically different between groups, 21.1 mo IL-BCG vs 13.8 mo MPV-BCG.  Not all pt had accurate skin tests reported, but no pt who was neg at entry for all skin tests had a subsequent objective response.  Put another way, initial skin test positivity correlated with response if stratified by treatment ,p&lt;0.05.</DATA>

Pt were evaluated after three courses of therapy and those with response were followed until relapse.  Pts groups were comparable for pretreatment characteristics- age,sex stage,met site, measureable disease, and previous chemo/immuno.  There was no survival difference between groups overall or between responders and non-responders (12 vs 4.7) or those pts with or without measureable disease.There was no difference between groups for overall response rate in those pts with measureable disease (20% vs 15%, PVD vs PVDM respectively).  One point of interest that approached significance in subgroup analysis was the response rate observed by pretreatment metastatic patterens in pts without prior chemotherapy.  Those pts with measurable disease limited to skin/lymph nodes had a RR that was higher than the RR for other pts combined (35% vs 17%, p=0.07).  Pts numbers were too small to evaluate remission duration.  In pts with non-measurable disease, the addition of MER did not prolong time to disease relapse.

				<DATA>This is the first report of the preliminary results of a PRT of BCG immunotherapy in early operarable malignant melanoma (stage 1b, clark&apos;s level 3-5, MDA staging system, no nodal or intransit mets).  Treatment group received BCG around the site of WE and at multiple puncture sites (40 mg in 1 ml) within 4 months of surgical treatment and then again after one year of oral BCG therapy.  Oral BCG 40mg was given daily for 5 days each month and begun one month after the first intradermal BCG injection and continued for 2 years.  The study was not stratified for prognostic factors and the groups have a slight bias against the control goup with more clark level 4 and 5 patients, and against the treatment group which had fewer extremity lesions.The DFS was not statistically significant at 20 mo follow-up between the groups of all randomized patients, though there was a trend favorring the BCG group.  A separate analysis of evaluable patients with clark level 3 and 4 lesions was performed with showed a trend in favor of the BCG group at 20 months follow-up for DFS, p=0.05.  At this short follow-up the authors have furthermore not a trend favoring the treatment group for relapse rate with 3 relapses in the treatment group and 10 relapses in the control arm.</DATA>

Overall, there is a trend in all three endpoints favoring the levamisole arm, however results are not statistically significant.  Subgroup analysis of patients with stage II disease (recurrent nodal disease or positive node dissection at study entry) show some statistically significant differences favoring the treatment group at some but not all time points.  This analysis was performed so as not to obscure a potential benefit in the higher risk patients.  Of note is that less than 50% of all patients had received 2 years of therapy making these results truly preliminary.</DATA>

Patients were treated at this single institution by the same group of orthopedic surgeons.  Supervoltage XRT was utilized at 4 wks postop to a dose of 178 rad daily for 5 days a week to a total dose of 2500 rad in 14 fractions.  This was followed by a 3-4 week rest interval with an additional 2500 rad dose to a total of 5000 rad in 28 treatment days.  All pts had bx proven nodal mets and the 2 groups were comparable for distribution by sex, primary site, ulceration, and depth of lesion.  The XRT group had younger pts with smaller lesions and more pts with just a single positive node which biased results.   Initially there appeared to be a difference in endpoints between groups, however covariate analysis of DFS and DFI using age, sex, treatment, and number of positive nodes substantiated this bias.  Age was the most significant variable for DFS and number of positive nodes for DFI.  Treatment did not significantly effect DFS or DFI.  The imbalance of pt prognostic factors favorred the radiation group and underscores the necessity of appropriate stratification in studying this patient group.</DATA>

Systemic immunotherapy was begun within 2 to 6 weeks of surgery.  BCG dose was 1-2 x 10(8) cfu delivered by tine technique to each axilla, groin, and circumferentially around each excision site weekly for 12 wks then biweekly thereafter.  Pts who received vaccine did so at the same time and schedule as BCG rx with 1 x 10(8) allogenic tissue-cultured melanoma cells.  The vaccine was mixed with 1 x 10(6) BCG for the first two innoculums and none thereafter.  No pts were lost to follow-up.  Pts who developed recurrences were given adjuvant chemo which included DTIC, BCNU or CCNU or high dose methotrexate.The incidence of recurrences was not statistically different between the two treatment groups vs control (45%-BCG vs 39%-BCG + TCV vs 40%-control).  The proportion of pts who died in the control group (33%) was slightly higher than those in the BCG (21%) or BCG-TCV (27%) arms.  This was due to the fact that pts in the BCG group (11 pts, 9.3 mo) who recurred lived longer than those in the control group (3 pts, 6.2 mo) who recurred.  Also, mean time to recurrence was greater in the BCG group (11.2 mo) than either the BCG-TCV (9.5 mo) or control (7.7 mo) groups.

Eligibility criteria included those with previous melanoma resection and subsequent local intradermal or subcutaneous recurrence not amenable to further surgical therapy.  Pt had no previous immuno, chemo or XRT.  Pt older than 70 and those with visceral or hematogenous spread of disease were excluded.  BCG injections involved .1cc of 5 x 10(7) cfu into each nodule initially followed by 5 x 10(6) cfu thereafter.  DNCB patients were first sensitized to the agent and subsequent treatments involved injection with 50ug to 2000ug of DNCB per lesion.   For both groups up to 25 lesions were injected every 4 to 6 weeks.  Pt with signs of distant mets were given chemo with methyl CCNU or DTIC.  Follow up of all pts was complete and included skin testing for antigens before and after therapy.  Other immune tests included e rosettes, phytohemaglutinin lymphocyte assays (PHA) and direct leukocyte migration inhibition assays (LMI).  Overall, 90% of all intradermal lesions in both groupsshowed regression whereas only 45% and 43% of subcut lesions showed regression to BCG and DNCB therapy, respectively.  Both groups were well matched for clinical characteristics including extremity melanoma, intradermal recurrence, and one pt in each group without evidence of disease at 20 to 39 months.  Pts with only intradermal rather than subcutaneous melanoma achieved local control with obliteration of all gross local disease.  There was no significant difference between groups for time to distant metastases and time to death.The only significant difference noted was the toxicity of therapy with that of DNCB being much less than BCG.  8%-88% of BCG pts experienced systemic toxicity whereas only 2%-4% DNCB pts experienced local ulceration or cellultitis requiring antibiotics.  Three pt on BCG experienced DIC with one near fatality.  In vitro immunologic tests and skin tests were not shown to differ significantly between the two groups.</DATA>

				<DATA>This small single institutional study attempts to define those measures of tumor directed immunity which may govern clinical outcome by utilizing an adjuvant BCG/autologous irradiated tumor cell vaccine delivered intradermally on postop day 14 in patients with localized recurrent melanoma deemed tumor-free following operation (stageIIB).  This group of pts was rigorously studied using a panel of immunologic measures and compared to a similarly studied control group which received no further therapy.  The groups were similar for distribution of age, site of primary and extent of disease.  Tests included measures of cell-mediated immunity, leukocyte migration inhibition, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, immunofluorescence, lymphcyte stimulation testing, measures of serum immunoglobulin and complement.The first evaluation compared treatment to control group for all measured values at two weeks and concluded that cell mediated immunity was slightly higher and IgD levels were slightly lower in the group subsequently given vaccine though not significantly different.  A second comparison of pts tumor-free at 12 mo and pts with recurrent tumor within 12 mo was performed and showed no significant trends  between immunologic measures and clinical course.While this paper focuses on correlation of immune measures with clinical outcome, the study itself was aborted due to a high recurrence rate in the vaccine group, although the authors do not evaluate this as an outcome measure this reported study.</DATA>

				<DATA>A single institutional study reporting a median follow-up 19 mo, range of 10 to 48 months in patients with clark&apos;s level 3-5 melanoma undergoing curative resection via wide 4 cm excision.  Prophylactic lymph node dissections were not performed.  All patients were free of metastases and were stratified according to site of melanoma.  Those pt with extremity lesions had intraarterial DTIC and vincristine 4 weeks prior to surgery in addition to combination chemotherapy (oral procarbazine, iv vinblastin, thiotepa, rufocromomycin, methotrexate) which began one month after surgery and continued every other week for 3 months then every 4 weeks up to 18 months. Overall, 29 of 117 patients developed local recurrence or metastasis.  52 of 62 (81%) patients treated with chemotherapy remain disease free while 36 of 55 (65%) patients in the surgery control group remain disease free.  Actuarial life table analysis showed a significant difference (p&lt;0.05) in DFS between for all points between 8 and 36 months.  Survival curves failed to show a difference between age groups, histologic type, site of primary melanoma or clark&apos;s level.  Only 54% of pts with level V melanoma were DF at 24 mo vs 72% and 76% for level III and IV respectively.  This was not significant due to the small number of pts with level V melanoma (n=10).  In addition, pts with limb melanoma who received neoadjuvant intraarterial chemotherapy did not have a survival advantage to those patients treated with systemic chemo alone.  In general, women fared better than men with respect to DFS, 75% vs 70%, respectively.  Results of chemotherapy according to sex showed a significant difference at 24 months DFS for male patients, 86% vs 60% (p&lt;0.05), chemo vs control, respectively.  This difference was not noted in female pts treated with chemo vs control.  Also there was a larger distribution of male patients with extremity melanomas and this subgroup analysis demonstrated a DFS of 80% at 12 mo with chemo and only 54% with surg only (p&lt;.02).

Log rank test comparing treatment in pts stratified according to sex and level of invasion showed a relative recurrence rate of control vs surg + chemo was 1.59 vs .69, respectively.

				<DATA>A single institution study which pathologically classified 213 pts retrospectively and identified 70 high risk patients according to the following criteria:deep lesions (clark 3-5), &gt;1.5mm depth, mets to lymph nodes.  Of these 70 patients, 25% developed recurrence at 12 mo and 50% recurred by 5 years after apparent resection for cure.  Patients were stratified and randomized to the above groups.  DTIC was given iv 200 mg/m2/d for 3 days each month for 6 months, then every 2 months for 6 months, then every 3 months for the second year.  Toxicity was manageable although 2 pts in each treatment arm had therapy discontiued due to gi toxicity with substitution of phenylalanihe mustard.  BCG was given by the tine technique to the low back area every 2 weeks for 12 wks, then every 4 weeks for a total of 2 years.  Flu-like symptoms occurred with BCG therapy and one pt required anto-TB rx for rising transaminases.  Chemoimmuno was given by combining individual programs as described.  Patients who recurred while on chemo or immuno alone were allowed to cross-over to the chemoimmuno group.Stratification was successful for age, delay in therapy, nodal status, level of invasion and site of primary.  There were more male pts in the DTIC arm.  Recurrence rates overall were the same for male and female pts (16%).  Recurrence rates between treatment group after surgical therapy showed an advantage to combination therapy (0/22 pt recurred) vs DTIC (6/20,30%) and BCG (5/28,17.8%) alone, p&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.05, respectively.  All recurrences were noted in pts with lymph node mets at time of primary treatment.  Survival curves showed an advantage of combination therapy although not clearly superior to immunotherapy alone; DTIC vs combination, p&lt;0.05.</DATA>

DTIC was given in one large iv dose (800mg/m2) one day one and was repeated along with other chemo agents every 4 weeks.  Characteristics of the pt population demonstrated successful randomization according to sites of metastatic involvement due to stratification methods.  The group was not stratified for sex and this was apparent with a disparity  in the DTIC + C treatment group with 61% males.  Overall RR were low with only 17 patients showing an objective response with a median duration of 5 mo.  62 pts or 65% of the adequately treated population had progression of disease from the onset of treatment.   RR did not differ with respect to treatment groups by sex.  Survival data showed a survival advantage of responders over non-responders or those who progressed (11mo vs 4 mo, p&lt;0.01).  Interestingly, those pts who had no change or minor responses had a simialr survival curve as responders and had an increased survival over those who showed progression.   Responders and non-responders were compared for distribution of variables of prognostic importance.

DTIC dose was 200 mg/m2 iv for 5 days every 3 weeks.  MCCNU dose was 200 mg/m2 po weekly for 6 weeks.  Combination therapy included DTIC dose 150 mg/m2 iv for 5 days every 3 weeks and MCCNU at 130 mg/m2 orally weekly for 6 weeks.  Treatment failures on single agent therapy were allowed to crossover to the other agent.Various prognostics factors related to chemo response were not significantly different between groups.  Toxicity included 3 drug related deaths.  Of note is that 25% of patients died within 60 days of entry although inclusion criteria stipulated a survival of more than 2 months.  Pts in general had very advanced disease and no particular treatment group was associated with early deaths.  Pts with CNS, liver mets and those who were nonambulatory died early.  Overall RR was low, only 15% and there were no significant differences among the treatment groups either in terms of RR, type of response, duration of response, or survival.  Characteristics that were favorable for response included being female, ambulatory, &lt; 50 yo, no previous chemo, no liver or CNS mets and having had a lower limb primary.  Responders especially those with favorable characteristics as noted had a better median survival than non-responders (51 wk vs 28 wk).

Pt without CNS involvement and those who had no previous chemo were included in the trial.  Due to the poor outcome of this pt group, the authors designed the study without a control group.DTIC was given at a lower than usual dose, 100mg/m2 for 5 days along with ICRF159 at an oral dose of 125mg twice daily.  Courses were repeated at 5 week intervals.  Immunotherapy involved vaccination with autologous irradiated melanoma cells mixed with 50ug BCG given intradermally at 11 days post chemo.  Toxicity was minimal.Followup for all pts was at least 8 mo.  Survival curves were identical for both treatment groups, however one year survival by stage without differentiating treatment groups showed a significant survival advantage for pts with regional disease (75%) vs disseminated disease (20%), p&lt;0.05.Response rates showed a trend in both treatment groups for a greater response of skin and lymph node sites vs visceral sites.  Immunotherapy appeared to increase response at certain sites, and due to the fact that no stratification was done and that there were more pt with visceral disease in the C+I group, response rates in this group did not approach significance.</DATA>

An additional criticism: the patients in the control group (who underwent wide local excision and regional node dissection alone) had a surprisingly poor outcome (39% recurrence rate at a mean follow-up period of 550 days).</DATA>

				<DATA>This prospective, randomized study compared ability of four treatment ranges of iodine-131 to completely ablate the thyroid gland remnant ablation following thyroidectomy.  The I-131 groups were divided into 25-34 mCi, 35-64 mCi, 65-119 mCi, and 120-200 mCi treatment ranges.  Successful ablation was measured at 6-12 months following treatment and defined by the absence of thyroid bed activity following a 5 mCi scan at 48 hours.  The results showed that increasing the I-131 dose to more than 50 mCi resulted in a plateauing of the dose response curve (at 77.8% ablation), supporting the use of 50 mCi (or 30,000 cGy) as an optimal dose for thyroid remnant ablation.   </DATA>

Radiat Oncol Biol Phys, 1988;15:1085-1090) by this group comparing fast neutron irradiation to photon irradiation in the treatment of inoperable, recurrent, or unresectable malignant salivary gland tumors.  This current report shows that at ten years there continues to be a significant improvement in locoregional control for the neutron irradiation group over the photon group (56% vs 17%).  However, there is no difference between the ten-year survival of the neutron group and photon group (15% vs 25%).  Long term morbidity was more severe in the neutron group, although there was no difference in life-threatening complications.</DATA>

Within the radiotherapy group, the largest BCCs were treated with conventional radiotherapy, the intermediate sized ones received brachytherapy, and the smallest ones received contact therapy.  The four-year actuarial failure rate was 0.7% in the surgery group, compared to 7.5% in the radiotherapy group (P=.003).  The cosmetic results as judged by independent judges and patients themselves were superior in the surgery group over the radiotherapy group.

The authors made an excellent attempt to standardize the surgery in a number of ways, including intraoperative teaching by a Japanese surgeon for all participating surgeons in the trial.  In additon, all D2 operations were attended by one of eight surgeons that had been specially trained in the procedure.Critique:  1.  Large number of patients with no lymph nodes identified in two or more stations that were to be dissected, called &quot;noncompliance&quot; (36% in D1 group and 51% in D2 group).  (&quot;Contamination,&quot; or lymph nodes identified from more than two stations than required, occurred in 6% of D1 and 7% of D2.)  Although the group attempted to train surgeons in the technique of D2 lymphadenectomy, these results show that a surgical standard was not adhered to in this multi-center trial.2.  Multicenter trial with over 80 participating centers.Summary:  Important trial which showed an increase in morbidity and mortality, and no survival advantage for D2 lymphadenectomy.</DATA>

All patients undergoing total gastrectomy had distal pancreatectomy/splenectomy and there was an increased morbidity in this group.   In addition, when results were analyzed according to whether pancreatectomy/splenectomy was performed, there was a significant survival disadvantage to having undergone pancr/splenectomy (p=.01). In all likelihood, this confounded the results because 57% of the D2 grp underwent distal pancreatectomy/splenectomy vs.4% in the D1 group.  2.

Patients with deep T lesions could participate in the study with or without a nodal dissection making the groups somewhat more heterogeneous.  However, the stratification  probably controlled for this potential confounder as demonstrated in the patient characteristic table.  An additional potential confounder may be that patients who failed therapy (usually in the observation group) received IFN and may bias the results against IFN.   Interestingly, unlike E1684 (Kirkwood, 1996) there was no survival benefit with high dose IFN.  In this trial there was a median of 52 month follow-up, and subsequent reports are to be expected.</DATA>

Soft glandular texture was an independent predictor of pancreatic fistula on multivariate analysis.

The authors calculated that eliminating the prophylactic use of octreotide would have led to considerable cost savings ($1,408/patient).  The remarkably low rates of pancreatic fistula in the treatment and control groups indicates that the study is underpowered to detect a significant difference in outcome between the two groups.</DATA>

				<DATA>Prospective randomized trial comparing [1] high dose radiotherapy alone (6,000 cGY) to [2] moderate dose radiotherapy (4.000 cGY) + 5-FU (500 mg/m2 on the first 3 days of each 2,000 cGy radiation therapy course, followed by maintenance 5-FU at the same dose on the completion of radiotherapy, administered weekly for two years or until disease progression)  and [3] high dose radiotherapy  (6,000 cGY) + 5-FU (same regimen) in patients with locally unresectable duactal pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  Radiation was administered in a split course technique ( 2,000 cGy course over two weeks - 200 cGy/day 5 days/week- anterior and posterior parallel opposed fields).  This study was conducted by the GITSG.  A total of 227 patient were entered into the study, of whom 194 were fully eligible;  70% of patients made it through the treatement to begin maintenance chemotherapy in the two 5-FU treatment groups.  48% of patients completed therapy in the high dose radiotherapy only arm.  Time to disease progression was significantly worse in the high dose radiotherapy only group.   There was no survival difference between the two groups treated with combined modality therapy, although median survival was twice as long in the combined modality compared to the radiation only group (41 vs 23 weeks, P &lt; 0.01).    Higher dose radiotherapy as part of a combined modality treatment regimen did not provide a survival benefit over chemotherapy plus moderate dose radiation.  This study confirms the prior Mayo clinic data demonstrating a survival improvement of combined modality therapy over radiation alone in patients with locally unresectable cancer of the pancreas.  Since 5-FU did not seem to reduce the frequency of distant metastases as first evidence of recurrence, it is presumed that its primary role was that of a radiosensitizer.  This study fails to answer the question of whether there is any survival benefit of combination chemoradiation therapy over chemotherapy alone.  </DATA>

				<DATA>Patients undergoing apparently curative resection of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were randomized to no further treatment (n=22) or adjuvant chemoradiation therapy [4,000 cGY supervoltage EBRT + concurrent bolus 5-FU 500 mg/m2 weekly for two years or until recurrence, n=21].  Adjuvant therapy was well tolerated.  This study is limited by small sample size; thus, the results are not definitive.  Survivals was significantly better for those patients with disease confined to the pancreas than those with regional nodal or contiguous organ involvement, and significantly better in those patients with ECOG performance status 0-1 [fully productive or fully ambulatory] than performance status 2-3 [partially bedridden].  Median survival in the treated group was nearly twice that of the observation arm [20 vs 11 mos, P=0.04].  The trial was terminated prior to reaching target accrual.  Accrual was limited to an average of 6 patients per year over the 8-year study period prompting the investigators to end the trial.  At the time of closure, the survival difference between the two study arms was significant.  Despite the limitations of the study, the findings suggest that chemoradiation therapy following apparently curative pancreatectomy for ductal adenocarcinoma may prolong survival. </DATA>

				<DATA>Phase III trial in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer comparing three treatment regimens: (1) 5-FU alone [500 mg/m2 /d, n=64]; (2) combined sequential 5-FU, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and vincristine [270 mg/m2 /d, 160 mg/m2 /d, 11 mg/m2 /d, 0.7 mg/m2 /d, n=61] followed by maintenance 5-FU [350 mg/m2 /d] and mitomycin C [3.5mg/m2 /d]; (3) 5-FU [300 mg/m2 /d] + adriamycin [40 mg/m2] + cisplatin [60 mg/m2, n=59].    Objective response rates for the three treatment groups were 7%, 21% and 15%.  Median survival was 3.5, 4.5 and 3.5 months respectively; thus neither combination regimen offered a survival benefit over 5-FU alone.  All three treatment regimens had similarly poor results in these patients with advanced pancreatic malignancy.  This patient group with advanced measurable disease has an insolvable problem with considerable tumor burden, and represents the least favorable setting for the demonstration of therapeutic effect.  The authors make a reasonable argument on the basis of treatment-related toxicity and marginal response rates (10-15%) stating that subjecting a patient with advanced pancreatic carcinoma to chemotherapy is only justifiable for the purpose of continuing clinical trials in the search of more effect therapies.</DATA>

				<DATA>Twenty - six patients with resectable pancreatic head cancer underwent post-operative observation (Stage I) or were randomized between IORT [2000 cGy] and post-operative EBRT [4500-5500 cGy in 150-180 cGy daily fractions over 5-6 weeks] (Stage II-IV).  Chemotherapy was not used as part of the trial but was used variably at time of recurrence.  Median survival was 18 months.  Peri-operative mortality occurred in 7 (27%) of patients. Of the 15 evaluable patients, 7 (47%) developed local recurrence, and 7 (47%) failed regionally.  Five (35%) failed both locally and regionally, and 5 developed peritoneal seeding.  Eight (62%) suffered distant diseae failure.  Thus, locoregional recurrence is the primary mode of intraabdominal failure.  This study is limited by the small number of patients evaluated.  It suggests that there are no outcome differences between IORT, EBRT and observation for resected pancreatic head cancer. The peri-operative mortality is high by current standards.  A strength of the study is the compulsive documentation of patterns of failure following complete resection of pancreatic head cancer.</DATA>

				<DATA>Between 1980 and 1984, a prospective randomized trial of resectable pancreatic carcinoma was completed at the NCI.  26 patients (ST II - IV) underwent resection and were randomized into intra-operative radiotherapy (20-25 Gy) or post-operative EBRT (45-55.8 Gy). Two underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, 14 total pancreatectomy and 10 regional pancreatectomy. Perioperative mortality was 27%. This study correlated nodal metastases with outcome.  Regional nodal metastases were evident in 15 of 26(57%) patients. Median number of positive nodes was 3 (range 1-12) with a median number of sampled nodes 34 (range 12-109).  Patients who were LN(+) had a median survival of 11.5 months compared to a median of 24 months in LN(-) patients. Local disease control appeared to be independent of nodal status. The small number of patients in this study precludes valid statistical correlation of the type of resection with overall survival.  Treatment-related mortality was considerably higher in this study than comparable modern series. The data suggests that positive nodes at time of definitive resection are an adverse prognostic factor for survival, but do not seem to influence local disease control.</DATA>

				<DATA>A prospective randomized double-blinded trial comparing intraoperative chemical (50% alcohol, n=65) splanchnicectomy to placebo (saline, n=72) in patients with unresectable pancreatic carcinoma.  Splanchnicectomy was performed at time of open surgery by injection of the splanchnic ganglia near the aorta at the celiac axis level.  The study groups were comparable.  Mean pain scores were significantly reduced or delayed the onset of pain in patients who did and did not have pre-operative pain in the patients treated with alcohol.  The results of chemical splanchnicectomy were less compelling in those who did not suffer pain pre-operatively. The effects of alcohol injection of the splanchnic ganglia were not permanent; the pain relief lasted 3-4 months.  Hospital stay, operative morbidity and mortality and resumption of oral intake were no different between the two groups.  73% of patients operated upon whom had unresectable carcinoma of the pancreas had no pain.  56% of the treated and 34% of the control patients never had pain up to the point of death.  Thus, some patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer never suffer pain, and for most pain is not an issue at time of initial surgery.  Patients treated with chemical splanchnicectomy had a significantly longer survival than control patients, an unexpected finding that is not explained by this study.  This study effectively employed quantitative (visual analogue scales) and serial pain assessments.  This well-conducted study definitively demonstrates benefits of chemical splancnichectomy in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer.</DATA>

Eighty -four patients with pancreatic and 24 patients with papillary cancer had radical operations.  Palliative surgery was performed in 252 patients.  After radical surgery the rates of morbidity, reoperations, and mortality were 43%, 18% and 11% respectively.  After palliative surgery the morbidity, reoperations, and mortality rates were 23%, 4% and 14% respectively.  The morbidity and reoperation rates were significantly higher after radical than after palliative operations.  The morbidity, reoperations, and mortality rates were not different after Whipple procedure and total pancreatectomy. Radical procedures including splenectomy had significantly higher morbidity than similar splenic preserving resections.  Biliary-only versus biliary and duodenal bypass, and pre-operative versus no biliary drainage had similar morbidity and mortality rates.  The above rates did not differ between university, county or district hospitals.  Splenectomy was the sole independent risk factor for morbidity following radical surgery, and the Karnofsky index the sole predictor for mortality in this study group.  In patients undergoing palliative surgery diabetes, Karnofsky index and liver metastases were risk factors.  The authors do not define radical surgery nor do they analyze the technical details of the various reconstructions that may impact on type and frequency of complication observed.  The mortality rates are higher than one should expect by modern standards.  The difficulties encountered with diabetic management and the death rate attributable to uncontrolled diabetes following total pancreatectomy is not addressed.  </DATA>

The frequency of resections, although comparable between the two study groups, was significantly different in the two risk groups (99% vs 28% in the high- and low- risk patients, respectively).  Thus, 72% of patients in the low risk (chronic pancreatitis) group had pancreaticojejunostomy.  Based on the study sample size, the total number of patients in this study could only support an analysis of the treatment groups as a whole, and statistical analysis of risk subgroups is limited by small sample size. The octreotide treated group experienced a significant reduction in overall morbidity when compared to the placebo controls, 15.6 vs 29.2%.  Octreotide treated patients had a significantly lower rate of pancreatic fistula than controls, 18.5% vs 9%.  There was no significant difference in rates of other complications between the two groups (including anastomotic leak, abscess, fluid collection, pancreatitis, sepsis etc).  Overall complications were significantly more frequent in high (cancer)- than in low (chronic pancreatitis)- risk patients, independent of treatment: 35 vs 18%.  When the patients were subdivided into high and low risk groups (cancer vs chronic pancreatitis) the morbidity difference between the two study arms was significant only for the low risk groups (18.2 vs 4.3%); this is most likely attributable to the significantly fewer pancreatic resections performed in the low-risk group. </DATA>

Patients with resectable periampullary carcinoma were prospectively randomized into one of two groups: pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ, end-to-end, invaginating technique, n=18) or controlled pancreatice fistula (CPF, n=17) following pancreaticoduodenectomy.  Overall operative morbidity was lower in the controlled fistula group (24 vs 56%, p&lt;0.01).  Abdominal sepsis occurred in 6(33%) patients reconstructed with PJ, and in 2(12%) with CPF.  Two (11%) died in the PJ, none in the CPF group (P=NS).  Hospital stay was significantly longer in the PJ group (26 vs 42 days, p&lt;0.01).  The CPF persisted from 21 days to 5 months (mean 73.4 days).  No patient developed an intra-abdominal abscess following drain removal.  No non-diabetic became diabetic post-operatively.  All patients in the CPF group were placed on pancreatic enzyme replacement, and none of them developed signs of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency post-operatively.  Median survival (12 [CPF] vs 14.5 [PJ] months) was similar in both groups.  A well-conducted study in small groups of well matched patients that suggests that a controlled pancreatic fistula following pancreaticoduodenectomy is a safe procedure, associated with less morbidity and shorter hospital stay relative to end-to-end PJ.</DATA>

				<DATA>This was a prospective randomized trial comparing end-to-end (invaginating/telescoping; n=46) with end-to-side (duct to mucosa, utilizing a stent; n= 47) pancreaticojejunostomy following classic pancreaticoduodenectomy for resectable periampullary cancer. The majority of tumors (60 of 93) were ampulla of vater primaries.   There was a trend to increased leak with the invaginating technique (15% vs 4%; p=0.09).  Patients reconstructed with end-to-end pancreaticojejunostomy were more likely to require TPN due to an inability to tolerate oral intake for any reason &gt; 7 days postoperatively (33% vs 11%, p =0.01).  Morbidity/mortality were 21%/6% vs 33%/9% (p=NS) in the end-to-side and end-to-end groups, respectively.  Operative time was longer (1 hr longer) with the duct-to-mucosea technique; operative blood loss was similar in both groups.  Independent predictors of surgical mortality were operative blood loss and hypoalbuminemia (Salb&lt;30g/L).  Age &gt; 70 yrs was not predictive of mortality.   </DATA>

				<DATA>A multicenter prospective randomized trial comparing standard (n=40) versus extended (n=41) lymphadenectomy with pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma.  Transfusion requirements, morbidity, mortality and overall survival did not differ between the two groups.  Unplanned subgroup analysis demonstrated a survival improvement in node positive (Stage III) patients undergoing extended lymphadenectomy.  Since we cannot know which patients are node positive prior to exploration with curative intent, this information is not readily translated into the clinical arena.  Extended resection did not decrease the rate of positive microscopic margins.  The technique of the extended resection is questionable.  25% of patients did not have oncologic clearance of disease.The study is underpowered to detect a survival difference.  Data on local and distant recurrence is not provided in this study.  Curiously, the number of nodes harvested was no different between the standard and extended lymphadenectomy groups.  Specimen harvesting was not standardized in this study.  Surgical quality and standardization is an issue in this major multiinstitutional endeavor.</DATA>

				<DATA>This study evaluates the impact of nutritional support on outcome among 100 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic carcinoma.Patients were stratified into three groups: TPN, standard continuous enteral nutrition, and continuous enteral diet + arginine/omega fatty acids/RNA.  The patients were well matched according to clinical and operative parameters.  Overall sample size is small and there is no control arm in this study.  Duration of nutritional support was similar among the groups; however, full nutritional caloric goal was realized in 84% of enterally treated patients and 96% of TPN patients.  The rates of fistula, delayed gastric emptying, GI bleeding, and cardiopulmonary complications were similar among the study groups.  Thus, enteral nutrition did not appear to increase the risk of pancreatic or biliary fistula. The severity of infectious morbidity was signifcantly lower in the immunotherapy group.  A significant number of patients in the enteral nutrition groups (38%) had treatment-related complications.  Patients treated at the time of surgery with Neoprine injection into the pancreatic duct to abolish exocrine secretion had significantly greater diarrheal complications than those treated with anastomosis; this suggests the need for postoperative pancreatic enzyme supplementation in this patient subgroup.Overall differences between groups may have been seen had the enteral nutrition started prior to operation, ie. before treatement-related immunosuppression.  This study provides preliminary data to support the role of postoperative enteral nutrition as an alternative to TPN in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer. Immunonutrition may reduce the incidence of postoperative infectious morbidity.</DATA>

Patients were well matched.  One third of patients in the chemotherapy only arm had treatment violations.  The incidence of severe hematologic toxcity was higher in the RT/chemo group.  SMF alone was well-tolerated, however when combined with RT was associated with considerable toxicity.  The authors recommend against SMF replacement for single-agent 5-FU alone, on this basis.  Survival at 1 year was significantly better in the RT/chemo group than the chemo only group, 41% vs 19%, P &lt; 0.02, suggesting that SMF chemotherapy alone cannot substitute for combined-modality treatment in locally advanced, unresectable pancreas cancer.  The authors site prior GITSG study data to conclude that combined modality therapy is superior to either RT or chemotherapy alone.  The study was terminated early based on the significant survival benefit seen in the combined modality treament arm.  The authors argue that protocol violations had no effect on the survival data.  </DATA>

This was a nonrandomized, prospective study.  Two hospitals participated in the study and one dedicated highly experienced surgical team each performed all of the PGs and PJs.Pancreatic ductal and biliary duct stents were placed at time of operation through which postoperative contrast studies were performed. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of demographic data, indications for operation, type of operation or anatomic characteristics of the pancreas at time of operation.Patients who had a PJ  experienced a significantly higher rate of  postoperative pancreatic fistula (13% vs 0%) and intraabdominal sepsis (6% vs 0%) than PG reconstruction.This is a useful, clinically relevant study.

Reoperative pancreaticoduodenectomy was an independent predictor of increased and induction chemoradiation an independent predictor of decreased pancreatic anastomotic disruption by multivariate analysis.  The remarkably low rates of pancreatic fistula in the treatment and control groups indicates that the study is underpowered to detect a significant difference in outcome between the two groups.</DATA>

				<DATA>This is a very well done study that was 1 of 2 studies published around the same time demonstrating the efficacy of adding irinotecan to 5FU based chemotherapy as primary therapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.  The study is large, multi-institutional and appropriately powered to answer the primary outcome measured (progression free survival).  As compared to the study by Douillard, et al, this study also addresses whether irinotecan alone is comparable to 5FU based therapy.  A major strength is that no cross over was allowed until the study endpoints were reached.  Many of the patients went on to additional chemotherapy regimens after the study endpoints, but a survival benefit was still demonstrated.  The study clearly demonstrates that adding irinotecan to 5FU is better than either treatment alone in prolonging progression free survival.  Although there is a statistically siginificant improvement in survival, it is small and does not control for the additional chemotherapy regimens given after the primary endpoints were reached.  </DATA>

				<DATA>NSABP B-06 randomly assigned patients to total mastectomy, segmental resection and axillary node dissection, or segmental mastectomy without radiation therapy.  All patients underwent an axillary lymph node dissection.  Eligibility criteria were someone different then the European studies, with tumor sizes up to 4cm being acceptable.  In addition, patients with clinically involved axillary lymph nodes were eligible for participation.  Therefore, patients with T!,2,N0,1M0 were eligible for inclusion.  Segmental mastectomy was defined as removal of the tumor and enough normal tissue removed to ensure that the specimen margins were tumor free. Radiation was given at minimum dose of 5000 rad.  Supplemental boosts or radiation tot eh operative area and radiation of regional nodes were not employed.  Patients found to have positive axillary lymph nodes underwent cytotoxic chemotherapy.  	Five-year results were made available in 1985.  Between 1976 and 1984, 1843 patients had enrolled and were included in the comparisons.  586 were in the mastectomy arm, 632 were in the segmental resection alone arm, and 625 were in the segmental resection plus radiation therapy arm.  There was no difference in the age, tumor size, or nodal status of the patients in each arm.  Of the 1257 patients who were initially treated by segmental mastectomy, 10% were found to have tumor at the margins of resection and therefore subsequently had a total mastectomy.  At 5-years only 7.7% of patients treated by segmental mastectomy and radiation therapy had a recurrence of tumor in the ipsilateral breast, as compared with 27.9% of patients treated by segmental mastectomy without radiation (p&lt;0.001).  Disease-free survival, distant disease-free survival, and overall survival were similar when comparing patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy with those undergoing segmental mastectomy.  Patients undergoing mastectomy had a 5-year overall survival of 76%, a disease-free survival of 66%, and a distant disease-free survival of 76%.  Patients undergoing segmental mastectomy had a similar 5-year overall survival of 85%, a disease-free survival of 72%, and a distant disease-free survival of 76%.	At 8 years of follow-up, the results continued to be similar (ref 1).  Ten percent of patients who had segmental mastectomy and radiation therapy had ipsilateral breast tumors, whereas 39% of patients who had undergone segmental resection alone had a recurrence within the ipsilateral breast. The disease-free, distant disease-free, and overall survival in the lumpectomy and radiation was still equivalent to the group undergoing modified radical mastectomy.  	In February 1991, staff members at the NSABP headquarters verified that St. Luc Hospital in Montreal, one of the centers participating in the study, had submitted falsified information on patients.  In March 1994, the NCI began a special audit of 37 of the 89 institutions participating in Protocol B-06 to assess the quality of data submitted.  The results of this audit demonstrated no significant differences in overall survival, disease free survival, or distant disease-free survival at 12-year follow-up (ref 2).  Local recurrence in the ipsilateral breast at 10 years was 10% of patients undergoing lumpectomy with radiation versus 35% of patients undergoing lumpectomy alone.  The removal of the data from St. Luc Hospital did not change the original conclusion.</DATA>

				<DATA>The second randomized trial assessing the value of radiation therapy in the treatment of DCIS is the European EORTC 10853 trial.  This recent trial accrued patients between 1986-1996 in 46 institutions.  Women were prospectively randomized following local excision of DCIS to no further treatment (503 patients) and to additional radiotherapy (507 patients).  Whole breast irradiation of 50 Gy over 5 weeks was given.  The median follow up was 4.25 years.  Extent of margins was not specified other than that DCIS should not be present at the margin of the sample  The 4 year local recurrence-free rates was 84% in the excision alone group, compared to 91% in the group that also received radiotherapy (log rank p=0.005; hazard ratio 0.62).  Comparing the local excision plus radiotherapy group to excision alone, the local recurrence rate decreased from 16% to 9% (p=0.005); DCIS recurrence rate decreased from 8% to 5% (p=0.06); and invasive recurrence rate decreased from 8% to 4% (p=0.04).Overall the numbers of invasive and non-invasive recurrences in the ipsilateral breast decreased. The metastases free rate at this early follow up was 98% in the excision alone group and 99%in the radiotherapy group. Additionally there was no difference in overall survival in the two groups.	These results are still early, however comparable to NSABP-17 results with the same follow up. The authors comment that their study did not confirm the theory of subgroups requiring different treatments, and that a histology review of their results would be forthcoming.  </DATA>

				<DATA>The technique of extended radical mastectomy, which combines the classic radical mastectomy with resection of the internal mammary node (IMN) chain from the fifth intercostal space to the base of the neck, was developed in an attempt to increase local control and survival in breast cancer.  To address whether dissection of internal mammary lymph nodes prolongs survival, a prospective, randomized trial comparing extended radical mastectomy to radical mastectomy was conducted from 1963 to 1968 by five participating institutions that, together, formed the International Cooperative Study. The trial, which analyzed 1580 patients (T &lt;7 cm, N0-1, M0), showed no significant difference between the two groups in overall 5-year survival or local-regional recurrence.  After 5 years, the International Cooperative Study ceased to follow the patients collectively, and each center subsequently reported their individual 10- or 15-year follow-up results.  Lacour (ref. 1,2)  found no difference in the 10- and 15-year overall survival between the groups; however, there was a statistically significant difference in local-regional recurrence (24% for radical mastectomy vs. 14% for extended radical mastectomy) at 10 years14.  This result was not seen at Lacour&apos;s 15-year follow-up (ref. 2) nor was it reproduced in other trials (ref. 3,4).  Koszarowski (ref. 3) and Veronisi (ref. 4,5) (both of whom had participated in the International Cooperative Trial) also reported no difference in overall survival and local regional recurrence at 5-year,12 10-year,(ref. 4) and 30-year (ref. 5) follow-up, respectively. Collectively, these prospective, randomized trials have demonstrated that surgical resection of IMNs does not improve overall survival and local-regional recurrence. </DATA>

				<DATA>This tamoxifen chemoprevention trial randomized 2,494 healthy women between the ages of 30 and 70 years old, who were at an increased risk of developing breast cancer due to a family history.  The women were randomized to receive 20mg/day of tamoxifen or placebo for up to 8 years.  With a median follow-up of 70 months, the frequency of breast cancer was found to be the same for women on tamoxifen or placebo (tamoxifen 34, placebo 36).It is interesting to note that postmenopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) were eligible to enter the trial without stopping such therapy and that women in the trial were permitted to start HRT if indicated.  Women who were on HRT at the beginning of the study had an increased risk of developing breast cancer, compared to non-users.  Women who began HRT during the study period had a significantly decreased risk of developing breast cancer when compared to those women who did not start HRT.This study did not confirm the results of the NSABP-P1 trial.  One possible explanation of this difference is the patient popoulation.  This trial involved patients with a strong family history of breast cancer, whereas in the NSABP-P1 trial most patients had non-genetic risk factors.      </DATA>

				<DATA>This paper along with the Danish trials are sentinel studies combining radiotherapy with chemotherapy. They have shown for the first time a significant improvement in disease-free and overall survival from adding postmastectomy radiation inpatients with positive lymph nodes. In this trial 318 premenopausal women with stage I or II breast cancer underwent  modified radical mastectomy. If after axillary node dissection lymph nodes were found to be positive patients were enrolled and randomized to chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In the group treated with combined therapy compared to the group treated with chemotherapy only, there was a 33 percent reduction in the rate of recurrence (RR 0.67; 95 percent CI, 0.50 to 0.90).  Disease-free survival at 15 years increased from 33% to 50% by adding radiotherapy (p=0.007).  Overall survival at 15 years also increased from 46% to 54% by adding radiotherapy (p=0.07).  The reduction in the relative risk of a recurrence that was obtained by adding radiation to chemotherapy was similar in the subgroup with one to three positive nodes and the subgroup with four or more positive nodes.	The median number of nodes removed was eleven, and this may serve as a limitation to this study.  This paper despite its limitations in surgical technique emphasizes the importance of locoregional control in the presence of systemic therapy by demonstrating its effect on overall survival.</DATA>

				<DATA>In this double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized trial 5,408 healthy women were randomized to receive 20mg/day of tamoxifen or placebo for a period of 5 years.  These healthy women were between the ages of 35 to 70 years old, had all undergone a hysterectomy for reasons other than a neoplasm and were not at risk for developing breast cancer.  The trialists and the data-monitoring committee decided to end recruitment early primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study.  With a median follow up of 46 months, there was no statistical difference in the development of breast cancer between the 2 arms.  Women using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) appeared to have a statistically significant benefit  from the use of tamoxifen.  Out of the 390 women using HRT and placebo, there were 8 cases of breast cancer , compared to 1 case of breast cancer out of 362 women using HRT and taking tamoxifen (p=0.0216).  There was a statistically significant increase in the number of vascular events that occured in the tamoxifen group when compared to the placebo group (38 vs 18, p=0.0053).  Overall, this study concluded that women using HRT appear to benefit from the concurrent use of tamoxifen.  The postulated protective effects of tamoxifen were not apparent in the preliminary analysis, but one must remember that the women in this study were not an increased risk for developing breast cancer.The main limitations to this study are that the trial was stopped early due to poor compliance among the tamoxifen group, and that the trial may be underpowered.   An additional limitation is that selection of hysterectomized  women produced a group at slightly less risk than normal of developing breast cancer. </DATA>

				<DATA>In this study, 386 postmenpausal women with advanced breast cancer, who progressed after tamoxifen therapy  were randomized to receive anastrozole 1mg, anastrozole 10mg, or 40mg of megestrol.  The study was double blinded for anastrozole but not blinded for megestrol.  There was no statistical difference for time to progression, time to treatment failure, time to death, or objective response.  One limitation to this study is that it had 80% power to detect a treatment difference of &gt;50% between anastrozole and megestrole.  Both drugs were well tolerated, with a low incidence of treatment-related withdrawals.  The principle drawback of treatment with megestrol was weight gain.  This study showed that anastrozole, given in doses of 1 and 10 mg daily, is both well tolerated and effective in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer  who have progressed after treatment with tamoxifen.</DATA>

This difference appearedd to be due to the lower rate of relapses in the pelvic region in the combine-therapy group. ALthough this regimen was also associated with higher rates of adverse effects, these effects consisted predominantly of transient hematologic and gastrointestinal effects, with no evidence of an increase in other serious effects. There was no evidence of a difference in the frequencies of late adverse effects between the groups.</DATA>

				<DATA>Summary :The randomized NSABP-17 addresses the impact of radiation on the treatment of DCIS. The NSABP-17 trial analyzed 818 patients with localized DCIS after lumpectomy.  Patients were randomized to observation or radiotherapy ( 50 Gy to residual breast).  Patients excluded were those where tumour free margins were unattainable or residual disease was detected in follow up mammography.  The initial results at 5 year follow up1 were a 73.8% 5- year event-free survival for the lumpectomy alone group, and 84.4% for the radiation treated group (p=0.001).  This was due to a reduction in the recurrence rate of ipsilateral breast cancers which was 16.4% in lumpectomy alone group and 7% in the group receiving radiotherapy.  There was a 50% relapse of invasive carcinomas for those who had not undergone irradiation compared to 28% relapse of invasive carcinomas in the irradiated group. 	This paper publishes the recently updated 8 year results.  Comparing the lumpectomy alone group to the irradiated group the local recurrence rate was reduced (26.8% to 12.1%, p&lt;0.00005), the ipsilateral DCIS recurrence rate was reduced (13.4% to 3.9%; p&lt;0.0001), and the invasive ipsilateral recurrence rate dropped from 13.4% to 3.9% (p&lt;0.0001).  The relative risk of ipsilateral breast tumours was 4.65 %/year for the lumpectomy group and 1.90%/year for the group with additional radiation (p&lt;0.00005).  However there was no difference in survival at 8 years.	Limitations in interpreting the results of this study include that there was no reference to prognostic indicators i.e. histologic type or nuclear grade.  Margins were free only when the tumor was not transected , and lesions close to the margin were not considered to represent a risk. Fisher B, Costantino J, Redmond C, et al.

				<DATA>This is an important trial where the effect of adding postoperative radiotherapy to adjuvant chemotherapy in postmastectomy premenopausal high-risk women was evaluated.  In this randomized trial from the Danish Cooperative Group, 1708 women underwent mastectomy for pathologic stage II or stage III breast cancer, and then were randomized between 8 cycles of CMF and locoregional radiation therapy or nine cycles of CMF alone. Comparing the chemotherapy group to the chemotherapy and radiation group the locoregional recurrence decreased from 32% to 9% (p&lt;0.001), disease free survival increased from 34% to 48% (p&lt;0.001), and overall survival increased from 45% to 54% (p &lt; 0.001).  The benefit from irradiation was seen in all subgroups : patients with tumors smaller than 2cm, 2 to 5 cm, and larger than 5 cm; patients with one to three positive lymph nodes and those with four or more; and patients with grade I, II, or III tumors.  The beneficial effect of radiotherapy on both disease-free and overall survival applied to all subgroups.	A limitation of this trial was that there were few axillary lymph nodes removed, where the mean number removed was seven. This small number of lymph nodes makes it difficult to determine which specific group of lymph node positive women would derive benefit from radiotherapy. Further, the rate of locoregional recurrence after mastectomy was also approximately 30% which is higher compared to other trials, and may reflect surgical technique.  Despite these limitations the importance of locoregional control in the presence of systemic therapy is demonstrated with its effect on overall survival. </DATA>

				<DATA>This study randomized 668 postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer to receive 1 mg/day of anastrozole or 20 mg/day of tamoxifen.  Patients had tumors that were hormone receptor status positive or unknown.  In both groups, approximately 50% of patients had tumors with unknown receptor status.  Through a median follow up of 19 months, there was no difference in clinical benefit between the groups (56.2% patients in anastrozole group vs. 55.5% patients in tamoxifen group). Median time to progression was also similar in both groups (8.2 months in patients in anastrozole group vs 8.3 months in patients in tamoxifen group).  This well done study concludes that anastrozole is at least as effective as tamoxifen as first line therapy of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women.</DATA>

				<DATA>The first reports from a modern prospective randomized trial of breast conservation therapy came from the National Tumor Institute in Milan in 1981.  Between 1973 and 1980, 701 patients were randomized to undergo either a Halsted radical mastectomy or breast-conserving therapy with a quadrantectomy and axillary lymph node dissection.  This operative approach involved the removal of the entire quadrant in which the tumor was found.  All patients with tumors of 2cm or less in maximal diameter and clinically negative axillary lymph nodes were eligible for inclusion in the study.  Postoperatively, patients who had been randomized to quadrantectomy underwent radiatio of the breast to a dose of 5000 cGy with either a 6 Mev linear accelerator or a cobalt unit, as well as a boost of 1000 cGy to the area overlying excision of the tumor.  Patients who were pathologically node positive (approximately 25% in each group) had further therapy.  Before 1976 this consisted of adjuvant radiotherapy with 4000 to 4500 cGy to the ipsilateral internal mammary and supraclavicular nodes.  From 1976 to 1980, additional radiation was no longer used but was replaced by the administration of chemotherapy.	The patient groups were similar with respect to tumor size, age and menopausal status.  349 patients were treated with radical mastectomy, and 352 patients were treated with quadrantectomy and radiation.  Actuarial disease-free and overall survival were equivalent in both groups of patients at 7 years of follow-up.	Further reports from the same institution regarding this group of patients have continued to demonstrate equivalence of the two treatment methods (ref. 1,2).  At a mean follow-up of 103 months, disease free survival was 77%in patients treated with a Halstead radical mastectomy and 80% in those treated with quadrantectomy, whereas the overall survival was 83% and 85% for the respective groups of patients.  Local recurrences at this time were equivalent in both groups.</DATA>

Patient accrual stopped at half the anticipated number because the planned interim analysis showed significantly improved (72% vs 45%) 2 year disease free survival with chemotherapy.  Now with longer follow up (median 59 months) patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy had improved overall survival, but disease free survival was no longer significantly different (50% vs 37%) at 4 years.  There were no treatment related deaths, and the toxicity, though significant, was acceptable.</DATA>

				<DATA>This meta-analyses reviewed trials on chemotherapy beginning before 1990, with follow up to at least 1995.  There were 47 trials with 17,723 women comparing polychemotherapy versus no chemotherapy.  The average follow-up was 10 years, and most regimens contained Cytoxan, methotrexate, and 5-flurourical (CMF). There were 11 trials with 6,104 patients comparing longer duration versus shorter duration of chemotherapy.  There were 5,942 patients in 11 trials comparing anthracycline-containing regimens to CMF.  Data was insufficient for patients over age 70.	The overall effect of polychemotherapy resulted in a 23.5% reduction in the annual hazard ratio for recurrence, and a 15.3% reduction for mortality.  This effect was broken down into several categories. Polychemotherapy is associated with a reduction in the risk of death of 27% in patients less than 50 years old, and 11% in age 50-69 years.  The proportional mortality reduction observed in all patients less than 50 years would change the 10-year survival in lymph node negative patients from 71% to 78% (an absolute benefit of 7%).  In lymph node positive patients, the 10-year survival would change from 42% to 53% (an absolute benefit of 11%).  The proportional mortality reduction observed in all patients age 50-69 years would change the 10-year survival in lymph node negative patients from 67% to 69% (an absolute benefit of 2%).  In lymph node positive patients, the 10-year survival would change from 46% to 49% (an absolute benefit of 3%).  One major finding of this study was that the relative reduction in mortality risks were similar for lymph node negative and lymph node positive patients.  Differences in survival were realized throughout the first ten years.For recurrence, polychemotherapy in the adjuvant setting is associated with a reduction in the odds of recurrence of 35% in patients less than 50 years old at age of presentation, and 20% in patients between 50-69 years old.  Recurrence reduction emerged during the first 5 years of follow-up.		The benefits of chemotherapy were seen irrespective of menopausal status, hormone receptor status, and if adjuvant tamoxifen had been given.   Adjuvant polychemotherapy reduced by one fifth the contralateral breast cancer incidence.  Among patients with lymph node positive disease, anthracycline-containing regimens compared to CMF demonstrated a small beneficial effect at five years (RFS 57.3% vs. 54.1%, OS 71.5% vs. 68.8%).  There was no survival advantage with eh use of greater than 3-6 months of polychemotherapy.</DATA>

				<DATA>Prospective randomized trial comparing gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m2 q wk x 7, 1 wk rest, then weekly x 3 q 4 wk, n=63) and 5FU (600 mg/m2 q wk, n=63) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic, unresectable, previously untreated, symptomatic pancreatic cancer.  This trial addresses the concept of chemotherapy-induced, palliative effect on disease-related symptoms such as pain, anorexia, and weight loss, and functional performance status. This group has developed the concept of clinical benefit -the primary endpoint in this study- as a composite of pain (analgesic consumption and pain intensity), Karnofsky performance status, and weight as a method to assess the effect of chemotherapy.  The clinical benefit components were validated measures rigorously assessed in an objective manner.  Clinically significant and sustained improvement in pain, analgesic consumption, and/or Karnofsky performance status were observed in 24% of gemcitibine and 5% of 5FU treated patients [p=0.002].  The duration of clinical benefit was 18 weeks for the gemcitibine and 13 weeks for the 5FU-treated patients.  One trial limitation that must be taken into consideration when evaluating these results is that this was a single-blinded study.Median survival was 5.7 mos versus 4.4 mos for the gemcitibine and 5FU groups, respectively [p=0.003].  The 6 and 12 mo survival were 46% and 18% [gemcitibine] vs 31% and 2 % [5FU].  Time to disease progression was 9 wks versus 4 wks [p=0.002].  Overall tumor response rates were 5.4% and 0%.  A significantly greater proportion of patients treated with gemcitibine than 5FU had Grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression.  Drug related symptomatic toxicity was generally mild for both groups. The beneficial effects of gemcitibine in terms of clinical benefit were not offset by severe treatment-related toxicities.  No cost-benefit analysis was provided. Control of tumor-related symptoms was better in patients treated with gemcitibine than with 5FU.  This is the first agent in over 3 decades that has demonstrated improved survival, albeit modest, relative to 5FU.</DATA>

				<DATA>A prospective randomized trial was performed by the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) between 1983 and 1989.  Eight hundred forty seven women were eligible for enrollment in the protocol, of which 662 were randomized.  Of these, 306 were randomized to modified radical mastectomy and 313 to a wide excision, axillary node dissection, and radiation therapy.  185 patients did not accept randomization, 60 of whom had breast conservation and 95 had MRM.  Patients were stratified according to randomization or not and treatment arms. Patients with stage I and II breast cancer were eligible for participation.  The excision in the group undergoing conservative therapy consisted of gross removal of the tumor.  The breast radiation dose was 5000 cGy, with a boost to the tumor bed and scar area of 1000 cGy.  High-risk patients from both groups received adjuvant chemotherapy.  at 3 yrs the recurrence-free survival was 80% with BCT and 76% with mastectomy.  A follow-up paper at 6-years of observation showed both recurrence-free survival (70% breast conservation vs. 66% mastectomy) and overall survival (79% vs. 82%, respectively) were once again comparable (ref. 1).  </DATA>

				<DATA>In the EBCTCG overview, 36 of 64 trials addressed the comparison of radiotherapy plus surgery with the same type of surgery alone in over 16 000 women.  Data on mortality was available from 36 trials overall when radiotherapy plus surgery was compared with the same type of surgery alone, ranging from conservative treatment with axillary clearance to mastectomy with axillary clearance.Overall the mortality was similar in patients treated with surgery plus radiotherapy or treated with surgery alone (40.3% vs 41.4%, p=0.05).  Patients in the radiotherapy group had a lower risk of death due to breast cancer (odds ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.88-1.00, p=0.03) and a high risk of death from other causes (odds ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.09-1.42, p=0.002).  Local recurrence was significantly higher in the surgery only arm compared to the combination arm (19.6% vs 6.7%, odds ratio 0.33)  The reduction in odds of death was more specifically 14±7 percent after mastectomy with axillary sampling, 12±9 percent after conservative surgery, 3±4 percent after mastectomy alone, and -3±4 percent for mastectomy with axillary clearance (a negative number indicates an increase in the odds of death).  Therefore the benefit of radiotherapy was seen least in the mastectomy group with adequate axillary clearance. Overall these results showed that there is a marginally significant reduction in mortality due to breast cancer (p=0.03), but not on mortality overall.		This meta-analysis also included 8 trials addressing the question of axillary clearance versus radiotherapy.  In these trials there was no apparent difference in total mortality (54.7% vs 54.9%) or in recurrence of a first event (odds ratio, 1.01).  However radiotherapy was associated with a reduction in local recurrences (odds reduction, 15=8 percent; p=0.06).</DATA>

				<DATA>This recent meta-analysis by Whelan et al. reviewed 18 trials of locoregional radiation therapy randomized in women treated with systemic therapy, to determine if mortality effects in recently published studies were consistent with other trials.  They defined inclusion criteria which included trials only where the same systemic therapy was used in both arms; allocation of radiotherapy was randomized, and the median follow up was 5 years or more.	These 18 trials comprised 6367 patients and were initiated between 1973-1984.  Most trials included both pre and postmenopausal women with lymph node positive disease treated with modified radical mastectomy.  In the majority of trials radiation was delivered to the chest wall, supraclavicular, axilla and internal mammary nodal areas ( in 3 trials the internal mammary nodes were not irradiated).	Data for recurrence were available for 13 trials.  Radiation was shown to reduce the risk of any recurrence (odds ratio 0.69; 95% CI 0.58-0.83; p=0.00004) and local regional recurrence (odds ratio 0.25, 95% CI 0.19-0.34; p&lt;0.000001).  Data for mortality was available for all trials.  Radiation was shown to reduce mortality by 17% (odds ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.94; p=0.004).  	The meta-analysis was re-analyzed excluding two recently published Danish trials whose results showed a reduction in mortality.  Mortality again was reduced with an odds ratio of 0.89 (95% CI 0.76-1.05; p=0.17), this being consistent with the overall results.  	The majority of earlier radiation trials, not included in this meta-analysis, focused on patients who did not receive adjuvant systemic therapy.  These studies showed a decrease in locoregional recurrence but not an effect on survival overall.  In the more recent trials, included in this meta-analysis, patients treated with systemic therapy demonstrated that radiotherapy not only reduces the risk of locoregional failure, but improves overall survival.</DATA>

				<DATA>This recent overview of 55 randomized trials of tamoxifen involved 37,000 women.  The overall analysis involving recurrence and mortality was restricted to 18,000 women with ER positive tumors, and the 12,000 women with unknown ER status.  Of the 8,000 women with ER negative tumors, it was found that tamoxifen did not provide any therapeutic effect.This overview looked at women treated with tamoxifen for 1 year, 2 years and 5 years and reported results as such.This overview concluded that adjuvant tamoxifen treatment substantially improves survival of women with ER positive tumors.  Tamoxifen benefits all ER positive women regardless of menopausal status, age and lymph node status.  The absolute improvement in recurrence was greater during the first 5 years , whereas the improvement in survival grew steadily larger throughout the first 10 years.  This study also revealed that the effect of tamoxifen in decreasing the incidence of contralateral breast cancer is related to the duration of the treatment.  Five years of tamoxifen produced a 50% decrease in the incidence of new cancers.  This benefit is maintained for at least 5 years after the tamoxifen is discontinued. </DATA>

				<DATA>In 1982, National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP)-B14 trial was designed to see the efficacy of tamoxifen in lymph node negative, ER positive breast cancers.  This study randomized 2,843 women to receive either 20mg/day of tamoxifen or placebo for 5 years.  In the second part of the study, the women treated with tamoxifen who remained disease free after 5 years were then reassigned to receive an additional 5 years of tamoxifen or placebo.  After 10 years of follow-up, the group originally randomized to receive tamoxifen showed a significant benefit.  Disease free survival in the tamoxifen group was 69% compared to 57% in the placebo group (p&lt;0.0001).  Overall survival benefit was seen in the tamoxifen group (80% vs. 76%, p=0.02).  Tamoxifen also conferred a 37% decrease in the incidence of contralateral breast cancer (p=0.007).  Through 4 years of reassignment of tamoxifen treated women to either continue tamoxifen or placebo, the benefit was seen in the women that did not continue tamoxifen.  There was a statistically significant difference in disease free survival between those women that did not continue tamoxifen when compared to those that continued tamoxifen (92% vs. 86%, p=0.003).  There was no significant difference in overall survival between these two groups (96% vs 94%, p=0.08).Overall, the NSABP-B14 found that tamoxifen decreased the incidence of contralateral breast cancer, decreased disease recurrence, and increased disease free survival in both pre and post-menopausal women.  There was actually a greater benefit in pre-menopausal women when compared to post-menopausal women.  Tamoxifen given longer than 5 years provided no benefit, and resulted in an increase in the incidence of thrombotic events and endometrial cancers.</DATA>

				<DATA>The Early Breast Cancer Trialists&apos; Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) has undertaken systemic overviews of randomized trials in early breast cancer every 5 years since 1984-85.  This report is of the randomized trials begun before 1990 that were unconfounded and compared radiotherapy plus other treatments (surgery) versus the same without radiotherapy. Forty trials involving 19 582 women were analyzed, with 2757 local recurrences and 9838 deaths.In all trials combined , 49.9% of women allocated to radiotherapy died compared with 51.2% of the controls, an absolute difference of 1.3%, which corresponds to a non significant 3.9% reduction in the annual death rate.  During the first 20 years of followup, for all patients and all radiotherapy regimens together there was an absolute improvement of 23.1% in 10 year survival (56.6% radiotherapy vs 54.5% control), but by 20 years the survival difference was only 1.2% (37.1% radiotherapy vs 35.9% control). Overall mortality comparisons in different subgroups was not statistically stable.Thiry seven trials were used to measure the effects of radiotherapy on the risk of isolated local recurrence. During the first decade this risk was reduced from 27.2% without radiotherapy to 8.8% with radiotherapy (p&lt;0.00001).  During the second decade the risk of recurrence  decreased from 30.1% with no radiotherapy to 10.4% with radiotherapy.Overall there was indeed a significant reduction in breast cancer death, but this benefit was only moderate .  In the absence of other causes of death the 20-year survival would have been 53.4% in women allocated to radiotherapy compared to 48.6% among controls.  The lack of any significant  difference in all-cause mortality suggests that the moderate improvement in breast cancer mortality was counterbalanced by an adverse effect of at least some types of radiotherapy on mortality from other causes. More specifically mortality by vascular deaths was significantly increased by radiotherapy.  The present meta-analysis has 20 year outcome data from 20 000 patients.  The benefits seen in this trial demonstrate an important principle that improved local control in early breast cancer, implies  a moderate but definite reduction in death from breast cancer.</DATA>
