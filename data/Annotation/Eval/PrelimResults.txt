Summary:
	- Approach: generate candidate list, use IPF filtering to reduce candidate list size,
	use concept language model approach to perform final mapping

	- Initialization time: 44.7 secs (ours) vs. 1.98 mins (metamap)
	- Annotation Time: 23.6 secs (ours) vs. 5.54 mins (metamap), a speedup of 14x 
	- Avg annotation time for each phrase: 14 ms (ours) vs. 204 ms (metamap)
	- Precision is 0.945

	- Evaluation was done as follows:
		- Generate a list of unique phrases from the corpus
		- Map all phrases using MetaMap
		- Keep all phrases mapping to a single concept (baseline corpus)
		- Run MetaMap and our annotator on corpus to map concepts and get stats
		- Compare our annotator's mapped concepts to the baseline corpus
		- For each phrase, count as successful if any of our annotator's concepts
		mapped to the single concept from the baseline corpus


Futures:
	- incorporate full variants from UMLS
	- adjust lamda parameter in concept LM and evaluate
	- failure analysis:
		- in single concept eval, why is more than one concept being mapped
		- why are some phrases not generating at least one concept
